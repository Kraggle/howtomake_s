I have uploaded it here: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/mystile \n\nHere is the updated Mystile theme, Storefront: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/storefront\n\nFind products to dropship for your store: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2CWrd2gdTIs\n\n(Please note: I deactivated the store - I only created it as an example)\n\nIn this Woocommerce tutorial, we teach you how to create a ecommerce store. Using Wordpress, it is very easy to create an ecommerce store. Even if you\u2019ve never made a website before, you\u2019ll be able to set up your own simple store. \n\nGo to Fiverr here: http:\/\/www.fiverr.com\n\nStep 1: Get iPage $1.99\/month hosting + domain name \n\nTo create an ecommerce store, you are going to need website hosting and a domain name. We strongly recommend iPage because it is very cheap ($1.99\/month) and you get a free domain name with your purchase. \n\nTo get it, simply click on this link: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/y\/ipage\n\nAt the end of the setup you\u2019re going to be in the control panel: Stay there for step 2.\n\nStep 2: Install Wordpress & Woocommerce\n\nIn the control panel click on the Wordpress button. Follow the instructions to install Wordpress. For more details, watch our video on how to create an ecommerce store. When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be able to login to your Wordpress admin account - do this.\n\nNext, to create an ecommerce store you\u2019ll need to install the Woocommerce plugin. You do a search for Woocommerce in the plugin search bar to find it, no need to download it. Be sure to activate it.\n\nStep 3: Install the Woocommerce theme Mystile \n\nNext, we are going to install the Woocommerce custom theme, Mystile. It is absolutely free. You can download it here: https:\/\/www.woothemes.com\/products\/mystile\/\n\nEven though it says it it is a \u201cproduct\u201d it isn\u2019t. It is free. Click add to cart and then create a free account to access it and download it. Return to your Wordpress admin and go to the themes section of your account (for more information, be sure to watch our video on how to create an online store). \n\nStep 4: Customize your ecommerce store\n\nThe first thing you want to customize when you create an ecommerce store is your shipping and payment options. We\u2019re going to set it up so that we can accept payments with PayPal, which means we can start getting paid straight away! \n\nHead to the settings and click on the setup button. Follow the instructions. You\u2019ll need to select what type of payments you\u2019ll accept and you\u2019ll need to select what countries you\u2019re accepting shipping from.\n\nThe next thing you\u2019ll want to do when you create an ecommerce store is add the items that you\u2019re going to sell. To start, create categories to organize the different types of items you are selling. After that, click \u201cadd product.\u201d\n\nFrom here you can add two major types of products: Simple and variations. A simple product is a product that doesn\u2019t have variations (for example, a mug that only comes in one colour) whereas a product with variations has multiple options for the same product (e.g. a mug that comes in multiple colours).\n\nFor all products, add in a title and a description. If you want your product description to be SEO friendly, ensure it is at least 400+ words long. Add in a picture gallery with your photos, and add a feature image to appear as your listing thumbnail picture. \n\nIf you select to add a simple product, you\u2019ll only have to put in one pricing option and one shipping option.\n\nIf you select to add a product with variations, you\u2019re going to need to add in the pricing and shipping options for each variation. \n\nNext, you\u2019ll want to create your homepage. Create a page. Name it \u201chome.\u201d Keep it blank for now. Next, go to your settings and select reading. Pick \u201chome\u201d to be the static page on your frontpage of your website. Next, go back to your page \u201chome\u201d and edit it. \n\nI recommend deleting the title \u201chome,\u201d adding in a custom banner, putting some text on the homepage (to make it SEO friendly) and to have a preview of your last added products. To do that, simply add this piece of code:\n\n[recent_products per_page=\u201d8\u201d columns=\u201d4\u201d]\n\nI also recommend customizing the following:\n\nAdd a custom logo (necessary)\nAdd a custom menu  (necessary) \nAdd an about us page (optional)\nUpdate the footer (optional)\n\nThis is a beginner tutorial on how to create an ecommerce store with Woocommerce - customize it more and turn it into a digital asset!\n\nTo get started, sign up for an iPage hosting plan now: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/y\/ipage\n\nPlease note, this contains affiliate links.","publishedAt":"2016-06-03T04:28:38Z","tags":["create an ecommerce store","how to create an ecommerce store","ecommerce store","woocommerce tutorial","woocommerce","woocommerce for beginners","ipage","ipage hosting","ecommerce","online store","wholesale ted","paypal","ecommerce tutorial","ecommerce for beginners","Mystile"],"title":"How to Create an Ecommerce Store: Wordpress Woocommerce Tutorial","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vQzy6rtGs3Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vQzy6rtGs3Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vQzy6rtGs3Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vQzy6rtGs3Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vQzy6rtGs3Q\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT1H9M50S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"707","dislikeCount":"82","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4720","viewCount":"244199"}},{"id":"y3Idp0CuKSg","snippet":{"description":"In this video, Sarah explains the two types of product categories on Amazon: Restricted vs. Unrestricted (or Gated vs. Ungated)\nUPDATE: Hi everyone.

Thank you & we hope you have a wonderful day, wherever you are in the world \ud83c\udf0e\n\nHere is the email template referenced in our video tutorial on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: \n\n\"My name is [INSERT NAME] from [INSERT BUSINESS NAME]. Our company director asked me to contact your company about working together on a lucrative, long-term venture. We are a company that sells products related to [INSERT NICHE HERE] and we do over 2 million dollars in sales each year. We\u2019re looking to expand our product range and create a profitable partnership between your company and ours.\n\nWe are planning to purchase [INSERT ITEM] to our product line. It would need to meet these specifications: \n\n* Specification (e.g size)\n* Specification (e.g. quantity)\n* Specification (e.g. colour)\n\nWe have been researching different companies in China that manufacture [INSERT ITEM] and we think that your company could be a great supplier for it. We would like to get some more information and have a few questions that we would like you to please answer: \n\n* Can we please get a sample of the product as soon as possible. Can you please let us know how much you will charge for the sample, including Express shipping to [INSERT COUNTRY], zip code [INSERT ZIP CODE]? We would like to pay with PayPal. \n* How long will it take to receive the sample?\n* What types of packaging do you usually use for this product?\n* How long does it take to manufacture once an order has been placed?\n* What is the product-per-unit cost including shipping via Air Express to the United States, ZIP code 85043?\n* Do you accept PayPal for the full-order?\"\n\nWe would be very grateful if you would contact us with answers to the above questions as well as any additional policies that we may need to know. We would also like to discuss with you further about doing a sample order for the product.\n\nWe are hopeful that we can start a mutually beneficial relationship. \n\nPlease add me on Skype and talk to me, as this is my ideal form of communication: [INSERT ID]\nAlternatively you can email me back at this address: [INSERT ADDRESS]\n\nKind regards,\n[NAME]\u201d\n\nHere are some final tips to keep in mind when you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba to manufacture your Amazon FBA private label products: \n\nTip #1 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Don\u2019t judge the supplier\/manufacture by their Alibaba response rate.\n\nThe Alibaba response rate only takes into account how fast they respond within Alibaba\u2019s email system, and it doesn\u2019t take into account how fast they reply to personal emails. This is not a good indicator of how responsive they will be to private communication, which is all you should care about.\n\nTip #2 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Avoid manufacturers that try to vet your business. \n\nIf a manufacturer comes back and starts asking questions about your business, clearly skeptical of the size of your company, it is best to move on. Manufacturers that do this will usually decline to work with you as they are only to work with other large companies, so you don\u2019t want to waste your time. \n\nTip #3 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: It is OK to work directly with a sales rep - if they offer you a better deal. \n\nWhen you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba, you\u2019ll discover that sales reps often have inflated prices (due to commission cuts). But occasionally, a sales rep will have a better relationship with a factory and so are able to negotiate lower prices. They will also often have good english, making communication easier. Vet sales reps and treat them as equals during the process of picking and choosing the right supplier.","publishedAt":"2017-03-15T21:45:47Z","tags":["how to find a supplier on alibaba","chinese manufacturer","find a supplier on alibaba","china suppliers","alibaba","alibaba suppliers","how to use alibaba","manufacturer","alibaba manufacturer","private label products","wholesale ted","sarah","amazon FBA","importing from China"],"title":"How to Find a Supplier on Alibaba & Find a Chinese Manufacturer","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WTZFMEDyvYk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WTZFMEDyvYk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WTZFMEDyvYk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WTZFMEDyvYk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WTZFMEDyvYk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M19S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"431","dislikeCount":"182","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7346","viewCount":"300982"}},{"id":"23-5_XZ2CLs","snippet":{"description":"We answer: \u201cWhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d Our updated Terapeak tutorial for 2017!\n\u25ba\u25ba Get your Terapeak trial: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/terapeak \n\u25ba\u25ba Get Ebook - How to Make $10,000\/Month Online: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\nPlease note: this description contains affiliate links\n\nIn this updated for 2017 Terapeak tutorial, we\u2019ll answer the question that all eBay sellers ask us: \u201cWhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d By teaching you how to complete product and competitor research. \n\nCompleting product research for eBay is a 3-step process:\n\nStep 1: Use the Hot Research Tool in Terapeak to help us pick a niche to sell in.\nStep 2: Use Amazon\u2019s 100 Best Sellers to help us locate products to analyze.\nStep 3: Use Terapeak to analyze the competition and demand for a product.\n\nAt the end of this process, you\u2019ll have a list of high-demand, but low-competition products to sell on eBay. It is these types of products that we recommend people focus on when they ask us the question - \u201cWhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d \n\nStep 1: Use the Terapeak Hot Research Tool to identify a profitable niche\n\nStart by signing into your Terapeak account. You will need to have a subscription to do this. The 7-day trial will give you access to it. \n\nThis is a list of niches that are currently selling the best and have the highest demand on eBay right now. Scroll through the list and look at niches that have at least a 33% success rate, and pick a niche. Look for one that will be easy to source items for. For example, in this Terapeak tutorial, Sarah points out that it\u2019s difficult to source items in the currency\/coin niche, but finding and sourcing men\u2019s athletic shoes is easy, which makes it a good niche to focus on.\n\nStep 2: Use the Amazon 100 Best Selling List to source items to analyze\n\nWhen people ask us \u201cwhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d They are usually struggling because they can\u2019t come up with a list of unique items to sell. This is because coming up with a list of products is difficult, and so they will usually think of generic items (such as t-shirts) that do not sell well because the competition is saturated. When it comes to selling on eBay, you want to be focusing on specific high-selling items, and a good strategy is to piggyback off of the Amazon 100 Best Selling Items for the category\/niche you selected in step 1.\n\nGo to Amazon, and open up the 100 best selling items for the niche you selected in step 1. We will then use this list in step 3. \n\nStep 3: Use Terapeak\u2019s Product Research tool to analyze the competition and demand\n\nWhen people ask the question - \u201cWhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d Our answer is always the same: Sell items that have high demand, but low seller competition. This means your items will sell fast and you\u2019ll have excellent cash-flow! \n\nTake each item you found in step 2 and then put it into the Terapeak Product Research tool. Use the original Terapeak Product Research tool - not their updated 2.0 version. When you do that, look and see if the item meets the following criteria:\n\n* It has an average selling price that is high enough that we\u2019ll be able to make a substantial profit per sale after eBay fees.\n* It has a sell-through rate higher than 33% as this indicates that we\u2019ll be able to flip it within 3 weeks. \n\nNext, filter the results by bid auctions only, and check to see if it has a bid-auction ratio of at least 2:1.\n\nThese are exactly the types of items we recommend people focus on sourcing when they wonder: \u201cWhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d Products that meet the following criteria:\n\n* High enough price to profit from after eBay fees. \n* Have a sell-through rate higher than 33% \n* Have a bid-auction ratio that is at least 2:1\n\nAre easy to sell, high-demand but low-competition products\/items! Look for these items when completing your eBay product research. \n\n***Tips for sourcing the products you find using this Terapeak 2017 tutorial*** \n\nNow that we\u2019ve answered the question of \u201cwhat should I sell on eBay?\u201d And shown you how to complete eBay product research, you need to actually source those items! \n\nHere are some eBay item sourcing strategies:\n\n* Craiglist: You can find both second-hand items and brand new items to sell on here. Don\u2019t be afraid to offer a lower price and negotiate. \n* Thrift stores\/garage sales: This is a good source of second-hand products but it is harder to find brand new items using this sourcing strategy.\n* Alibaba: If you locate an item that has potential for wholesale, then use Alibaba to source cheap wholesalers for the product. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: Affiliate links are in this video description.","publishedAt":"2017-03-03T00:56:48Z","tags":["what should I sell on ebay","terapeak tutorial","terapeak tutorial 2017","terapeak","ebay","ebay product research","product research tool","items to sell on ebay","ebay item research","ebay competitor research","wholesale ted","sarah"],"title":"What Should I Sell on eBay?

You can save money by buying a 1-year plan and not getting domain privacy. If you want to buy an SSL certificate, buy the SSL certificate at the first stage in the checkout process to get it the cheapest. \n\nStep 2 to create an Aliexpress dropshipping store: Install Wordpress \n\nIn the iPage control panel, click on \u201cWordpress.\u201d Use the Mojo Marketplace installer to install Wordpress. Be sure to install it on your domain ending in .com (and not .ipage) and keep the directory empty (and yes - it\u2019s OK to overwrite it). \n\nStep 3 to create an Aliexpress dropshipping store: Install WooCommerce \n\nGo to WooCommerce and create an account. Install it using their 1-click installation. Then go through the installer program. Be sure to add PayPal as your payment processor, and select Stripe IF you purchased an SSL certificate. \n\nStep 4 to create an Aliexpress dropshipping store: Add free shipping\n\nGo to the shipping settings in WooCommerce and create a shipping zone. Target worldwide and select it to be free shipping. \n\nStep 5 to create an Aliexpress dropshipping store: Install Mystile\n\nMystile is a free Wordpress theme. Download it (make sure you have verified your Wordpress account first), upload it to your store and then activate it. \n\nStep 6 to create an Aliexpress dropshipping store: Get a WooDropship account\n\nGo to WooDropship and sign up for a free trial account. Then install the Chrome extension.\n\nStep 7 to create an Aliexpress dropshipping store: Add products \n\nOpen your chrome browser. Go to Aliexpress and search for the product you want to add. Click the WooDropship button to add the product to your Import list. Switch back to WooDropship and go to your Import list. Replace the title and description with your desired title\/description. Click \u201cpush to store.\u201d\n\nClick edit on the product that WooDropship has pushed to your store:\n\n* Edit the formatting\n* Change the price and edit product variations\n* Change to a full-width page layout\n* Add a short product description\n* Remove and edit the photos in the image gallery\n* Put your product in it\u2019s correct category \n\nStep 8: Update the sidebar\n\nGo to widgets. Delete all of the widgets in the primary sidebar. Find the \u201cWooCommerce Products\u201d widget and place it in here. Keep the settings as they are and click save. \n\nStep 9: Add a custom logo\n\nIn the Mystile general settings tab, upload your custom logo. Have it set to hide the site title and tagline. \n\nStep 10: Update the footer \n\nIn the Mystile settings click footer customization. Scroll down and tick \u201cenable custom footer (right).\u201d Keep the box empty and save changes. \n\nStep 11: Update the homepage\n\nCreate a new page and set it to be the homepage in the reading settings. Add a banner image, text copy and add this shortcode to show the 8 latest products: [recent_products per_page=\"8\" columns=\"4\"]\n\nStep 12: Create an about us \n\nCreate a new page. Title it \u201cAbout Us.\u201d Add in website copy and at least 1 image, then save the page.\n\nStep 13: Create a custom menu \n\nCreate a menu: Homepage, products (with submenu under this containing product categories), cart, checkout, about us & my account. \n\nStep 14: Launch your store\n\nClick on the button in the dashboard that turns off the \u201ccoming soon\u201d page - done!","publishedAt":"2017-05-15T20:43:47Z","tags":["aliexpress dropshipping store","create an aliexpress dropshipping store","woocommerce dropshipping store","woocommerce","aliexpress","dropshipping","woodropship","semi-automated dropshipping","dropship","wholesale ted","aliexpress dropshipping tutorial","woocommerce tutorial","wordpress","wordpress dropshipping store","mystile","ipage","oberlo"],"title":"How to Create an Aliexpress Dropshipping Store with WooCommerce that's Semi-Automated","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qih6gvJWXPI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qih6gvJWXPI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qih6gvJWXPI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qih6gvJWXPI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Qih6gvJWXPI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT55M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"587","dislikeCount":"76","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3290","viewCount":"173507"}},{"id":"6FeCdjnFxWA","snippet":{"description":"In this video, we give you 6 tips for private labeling on Amazon FBA & choosing a product picking a product.\nGet Jungle Scout: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/junglescout (affiliate link) \nUPDATE: Hi everyone.

Because having an Amazon Pro Merchant Account is a necessary prerequisite to winning the Buy Box. Winning this is crucial as a new seller for two reasons:\n\n1) About 80% of sales are made using the Buy Box - so not winning this means you miss out on crucial sales opportunities. \n\n2) When you are the featured seller in the Buy Box the number of reviews you have are not featured, so it means that new sellers won\u2019t be discriminated against for having little-to-no reviews by buyers. \n\nEven though it costs money compared to opening a free seller account, I strongly recommend it because you\u2019ll make more money with one. \n\nSecond thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Have the documents ready when applying for an Amazon account\n\nWhen creating an Amazon account, you will need the following documents: \n\n1) Photos of a national ID (like a passport or a drivers license).\n2) A bank statement with your address on it. \n\nSo before you start an account, take photos and download your latest bank statement and upload these documents when Amazon asks for them. \n\nThird thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Act fast - DON\u2019T wait! \n\nAmazon is regularly changing their requirements. For example\u2026\n\n* In 2014 they changed Personal Care into a restricted category.\n* In 2016 they made it so new FBA sellers couldn\u2019t send in their first shipment during the 4th quarter. \n* And in 2017, they changed it so you need to upload proof of ID documents during the account creation process. \n\nThe sooner you get started, the easier it\u2019ll be. \n\nFourth thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Pick your Amazon business model\n\nThere are several types of business models to pursue when opening your Amazon store (private labeling, wholesale selling, dropshipping & retail arbitrage). Before you open your Amazon business, you need to pick the right one that meets your skillset and access to resources.\n\nFor example, private labeling has the advantage of being very hands-off. But it requires a large upfront investment. While a dropshipping business takes more time to manage, but it requires a lot less money to get started. Weigh up the pros & cons. \n\nFifth thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Get a credit card (or a debit card)\n\nWhen you sell on Amazon you need to pay selling fees. To pay these, Amazon requires you have either a credit card or a debit card. You cannot use a Payoneer card or a prepaid debit card. If you don\u2019t have this, then consider opening an Aliexpress dropshipping store on your own website. \n\nSixth thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Figure out a plan to manage your cash flow \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid by the word \u201ccash flow.\u201d All we mean is that you need to have a plan for how you are going to pay for the items you are going to sell. Why? Because Amazon holds your money for 2 weeks as a new seller. This means:\n\n1) If you\u2019re dropshipping, you need to have money to use in the meantime to order the items the customer has purchased.\n\n2) If you\u2019re private labeling, it\u2019s prudent to have money set aside to replace inventory if your product gets super-successful super-fast. \n\nWhile you could save up hundreds to thousands of dollars, the easiest way to manage this is with a credit card. If you don\u2019t have a credit card then I recommend working on your credit score and making it a priority to get one. \n\nSeventh thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Check if the category you want to sell in is restricted \n\nSome item categories on Amazon are unrestricted (ungated categories) and you can sell in them without submitting an application (e.g. home & gardening). But some categories are restricted (gated categories). Some categories are very easy to get unrestricted in (like clothing & accessories) but some are more difficult (e.g. food & grocery). Be sure to check before getting started. \n\nEighth thing to do BEFORE you start selling on Amazon: Set aside time each day\/week to manage\/grow your Amazon business. \n\nMake sure you set aside time each day to fulfill orders & answer emails\/questions. And set aside time each week to grow your business. For many this will be working on weekends. Doing this can be challenging: But it\u2019s a right of passage that most business owners go through. So don\u2019t get discouraged: The rewards are well worth it!","publishedAt":"2017-06-28T00:50:08Z","tags":["things to do before you start selling on amazon","selling on amazon","new amazon seller","dropshipping on amazon","private labeling on amazon","amazon","creating an account","amazon national id","credit cards","amazon fees","amazon restricted categories","amazon pro merchant account"],"title":"8 Things to Do BEFORE You Start Selling on Amazon (Tips for New Amazon Sellers)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LSh6jeETMyI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LSh6jeETMyI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LSh6jeETMyI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LSh6jeETMyI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LSh6jeETMyI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"718","dislikeCount":"378","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16161","viewCount":"538591"}},{"id":"yIHRbRcgMeo","snippet":{"description":"Discover our top 10 free woocommerce plugins.

Get our free ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step \n\nFreightos: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/freightos \n\nFirst mistake importers make when importing products from China: Assuming that shipping by sea will be the cheapest option \n\nA lot of new importers think they will save money if they ship by sea rather than air. On the surface it seems cheaper as importers usually pay around 60 cents\/KG when shipping via sea, compared to the $7\/KG when shipping by air courier.\n\nUnfortunately what they don\u2019t realize is that the reason it\u2019s that cheap is because when shipping via sea, you ship via container, and you need to rent an entire container. They are very large and require you to be shipping hundreds of KGs to be making it worth your time. \n\nIf you are an Amazon private label seller, you are unlikely to have enough stock being shipped to fill a container by at least 60-70% so it will be cheaper to ship by air. \n\nWhen shipping by air, you have two options:\n\n1) Air freight\n2) Air courier\n\nAir courier is when you have your items shipped door-to-door. It is the easiest but the most expensive per KG (although in smaller quantities it is cheaper).\n\nAir freight is when you have your items flown from one airport to the other. You will need to organize other additional services:\n\n* Having the items delivered to the airport\n* A customs broker\n* Having the items delivered from the airport to the final location.\n\nThere are a lot of fixed fees with this which means it becomes cheaper to use air freight with larger quantities. To figure out which option will be cheaper for you, I recommend using Freightos.\n\nSecond mistake importers make when importing products from China: Not using the Metric system\n\nIn China, they use the Metric system and not the Imperial system. So be sure to use KGs instead of lbs and CM instead of inches. It\u2019s important to remember that when working with Chinese suppliers that they expect you to work on their terms and their timeframes. \n\nIt can be frustrating, but it\u2019s worth it for the cheap Chinese products you import! \n\nThird mistake importers make when importing products from China: Using Less than Container Load for shipping\n\nWhen shipping by sea, you have two options:\n\n1) FCL which stands for Full Container Load\n2) LCL which stands for Less than Container Load\n\nInexperienced importers fall for the trap of shipping with LCL because they see that the price are extremely cheap. What they don\u2019t realize is that these LCL companies have special deals with the ports to charge you extremely high Destination Service Charges. The LCL companies then make their money in the form of a \u201crebate\u201d which is essentially commissions\/kickbacks. \n\nDestination Service Charges are usually priced per-container and cost between $500-$1000 per container for ports in the USA. But when shipping by LCL you end up paying a high fee per cubic meters. It means that you often end up paying a fee comparable to shipping an entire container.\n\nDon\u2019t fall for this trap: If you can\u2019t break even with FCL, then ship by air. \n\nFourth mistake importers make when importing products from China: not calculating the correct duties you will need to pay\n\nWhen you import products from China, you will need to pay duties at the border. If you don\u2019t calculate the correct rate you can get a shock if it comes back as more than you expected. \n\nDuties can be a bit complicated to work out because there are a lot of variables. For example, if you imported woolen jackets, you need to consider which country the wool came from, as some countries (like Israel) have duty-free agreements over wool, which would reduce the duties you had to pay. On the other hand if synthetic fibres were used instead of pure wool, then your duty rates would be higher since there are higher duties applied to synthetic fibres within the USA.\n\nTo figure out what your duty rate is, find out what the HTS (Harmonized Tax System) code is for your item. To find this, ask your Chinese supplier as they will most likely know. You can then go through the HTS manual and find what the duty rate is for the HTS code of your products. \n\nFifth mistake importers make when importing products from China: being afraid to make mistakes\n\nAnd finally - don\u2019t be afraid to make mistakes. Through making mistakes you learn how to overcome them the next time and make even more money. Mistakes are apart of entrepreneurship. Learn from others - and learn from your own as well!","publishedAt":"2017-07-11T23:47:11Z","tags":["importing from china","importing mistakes","china","freightos","air freight","air courier","sea shipping","LCL","FCL","Full container load","Less than Container Load","importing","duties","calculating duties","HTS","Harmonzed Tax System"],"title":"5 Mistakes New Importers Make When Importing Products from China","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tb7PNEU1r5w\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tb7PNEU1r5w\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tb7PNEU1r5w\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tb7PNEU1r5w\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tb7PNEU1r5w\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M39S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"963","dislikeCount":"412","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"17223","viewCount":"529772"}},{"id":"-edMSxkCxJI","snippet":{"description":"Learn how to blindly dropship items from Aliexpress (hide the supplier & price!).\n\nWant to start a dropshipping business? Get our free ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\n6 Tips for Dropshipping with Aliexpress: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vgSiIbAuooc\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We strongly recommend that you watch the video. In this video, we do an Aliexpress unboxing from items that we requested to have blindly dropshipped, so you can see exactly what the customers receives when you blind dropship an item. \n\nHere at Wholesale Ted, we get asked a lot of questions in-regards to this\u2026\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t the Aliexpress seller include an invoice in the package, telling the buyer the real price I paid? Won\u2019t they get angry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to dropship from Aliexpress because sellers include marketing information (like their seller name and coupon codes) that identifies them, so the buyer can go direct to the Aliexpress seller.\u201d\n\nLuckily, there is a simple solution to this - and that is to blindly dropship your items from the Aliexpress suppliers.\n\nQUESTION: What is Blind Dropshipping? \n\nANSWER: Blind dropshipping is when a supplier dropships an item without including any marketing or advertising identifying them as the seller. It also means they don\u2019t include an invoice so the customer can\u2019t see how much you paid. As a result, the buyer as no idea where you go the item from (so they can\u2019t go direct to them) and they don\u2019t know the real price of it. \n\nQUESTION: That\u2019s great\u2026 how do I blindly dropship then? \n\nANSWER: It\u2019s actually very simple. All you need to do is ask the Aliexpress supplier to do it. \n\nWhen you purchase an item, on the checkout page you\u2019ll be offered an option to leave a message for the seller. Simply type in a message like this:\n\n\"Hi there. Please do not include an invoice or any marketing materials with this order. Please blindly dropship this item. Thank you\" \n\nIf you add a message like this, then your item will be shipped out and not include any invoices\/marketing materials\/coupon codes inside.\n\nQUESTION: Why would suppliers be willing to blindly dropship? \n\nANSWER: A lot of Aliexpress sellers are used to working with dropshippers, and actively seek them out. Why? Because dropshippers can do large amounts of volume, and be very profitable for them. As a result of working with us, Aliexpress suppliers are used to the needs of dropshippers and know how to ship while hiding their identity. \n\nQUESTION: Why in this video do you recommend working with Aliexpress suppliers that have a feedback score between 2,000-2 million?\n\nANSWER: Sellers in this feedback range are the \u201csweet spot.\u201d They are established suppliers, so likely have previous experience working with dropshippers and will understand your requests. Yet they aren\u2019t doing an absolutely insane amount of sales volume, so they will be more likely to pay close attention to messages. \n\nQUESTION: Is there anything else I do to ensure the supplier will blind dropship my item? \n\nANSWER: Yes - there is. If you\u2019d like to be doubly safe, then we recommend reaching out to the supplier and messaging them. You can ask them if they offer blind dropshipping, and check that they understand what it is. \n\nQUESTION: So you say that you ordered items from Aliexpress suppliers and unboxed them in the video\u2026 was any marketing material or invoices included in the packages? \n\nANSWER: Nope! We ordered four different items from four different suppliers. All of the suppliers were in the feedback score range we recommended in this video (2,000 to 2 million). There was nothing included on or in the packages indicating who the seller was. There were no invoices included in the packages, indicating the true cost of the item. And there were no coupons included in the package, and they made no attempts to try and \u201cpoach\u201d customers.\n\nAnd finally, here is something to keep in mind\u2026 this highlights something very important: oftentimes, seemingly complicated problems have very simple, easy solutions. \n\nWe\u2019ve noticed that a ot of people get held back from starting a dropshipping business because of this issue. They tell us things like:\n\n\u201cI want to do this, but I\u2019m worried the customer will get an invoice in their package.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to start a dropshipping business, but it won\u2019t work, because the Aliexpress seller will include advertising information in the package, identifying them.\u201d\n\nWell\u2026 a little bit of research reveals that actually - this isn\u2019t true at all if you just ask them to not do so! They will leave all of that out. So remember - if you hit a stumbling block along the way, don\u2019t let it stop you. The solution to it is likely simpler that you realized.","publishedAt":"2017-08-29T23:00:01Z","tags":["dropship","aliexpress dropship","dropshipping","aliexpress","blind dropship","blind dropshipping","aliexpress unboxing","wholesale ted","hide dropshippers identity","aliexpress suppliers"],"title":"How to Blind Dropship from Aliexpress (hide the supplier + hide the price!)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-edMSxkCxJI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-edMSxkCxJI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-edMSxkCxJI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-edMSxkCxJI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-edMSxkCxJI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"772","dislikeCount":"154","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8467","viewCount":"246150"}},{"id":"hkL3vu8PR2g","snippet":{"description":"Watch to learn how 6 Facebook ad tips when promoting Aliexpress dropshipping stores.\n\nGet our free ebook - How to Make $10,000\/Month with Dropshipping: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step \n\n***OTHER LINKS DISCUSSED IN THIS VIDEO***\n\n* 10 Tips for Dropshipping w\/ Fred Lam: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tEG5Ls-Rgxw \n* How to Create a Shopify Store: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IakKkA_DWdQ\n* Fred Lam\u2019s YouTube channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC-ExnmYdw61X-LLLePbUFPA\/videos \n\n#1 Of Our Facebook Ad Tips: Spy on Your Competitor Ads for Free Using the Search Bar\n\nOne of the easiest ways to see if a product has potential is to see if your competitors are having success with it through spying on their ads. There are great paid products to help you spy on your competitors but you can do it for free using the search bar if you are on a budget. \n\nTo do so, go to the search bar and type in something like this:\n\n\u201cPosts about \u201cfree shipping \u201ccoffee cups\u201d\u201d \n\nYou can replace \u201cfree shipping\u201d with some other type of common offer like 50% off, and replace \u201ccoffee cups\u201d with whatever item you are dropshipping from Aliexpress. \n\nNow Facebook will search for posts that include this text. Most likely, posts that use these types of words\/phrases in them are ads, so you can go through and spy on posts that have a high engagement. \n\nSomething to keep in mind is that just because a post has a lot of engagement doesn\u2019t mean it was necessarily profitable, it just means that quite a bit of money was spent on it. Sometimes people will spend money on ads that don\u2019t work - so it\u2019s not a foolproof way to see, but it helps.\n\n#2 Of Our Facebook Ad Tips: Select \u201cProduct Conversion\u201d for your Facebook Objective \n\nWhen doing Aliexpress dropshipping and creating your ads, you\u2019ll be able to select and objective for your ad. This is the objective that Facebook will focus on. The only objective you should select is \u201cconversion\u201d - specifically, a product conversion. \n\nIn addition, you can also set it up so that each of your individual products has their own product conversion pixel. If you go to this extra effort, it will help Facebook put the ad in front of the right audience specifically for that individual product. \n\n#3 Of Our Facebook Ad Tips: The Higher Your Ad Budget, the Better Quality Visitors You\u2019ll Target\n\nOn Facebook, not all users are equal. Some users engage on posts a lot, click on ads and buy things from ads shown to them on Facebook. On the other hand, some users don\u2019t engage much, don\u2019t click on many links and are less likely to buy things from ads they are shown on Facebook. Users that engage a lot cost more to be advertised to compared to those that don\u2019t.\n\nWhen you start advertising on Facebook with a small ad budget ($3-5\/day) you\u2019ll initially have your ad shown to lower-quality users because they are cheaper and Facebook doesn\u2019t want to blow your budget. As you scale your advertising to $40-200\/day, you\u2019ll hit higher quality users, and once you scale to $200+ day you\u2019ll hit the most engaged users. \n\nYou need to slowly scale up your campaign to hit the right user base for your ad so that you can discover what Fred likes to call the \u201csweet spot.\u201d \n\n#4 Of Our Facebook Ad Tips: Don\u2019t Get Penalized by Audience Overlap \n\nWhen advertising on Facebook and testing multiple products, if you use the same audience targeting for each product, you\u2019ll risk your ads overlapping and competing with each other. If ads start to compete with each other, then the CPM will skyrocket. To avoid this, try and create unique targeting for each product you test if possible, and exclude the interests you targeted in your other ads. \n\n#5 Of Our Facebook Ad Tips: Be Aware of \u201cForced Likes\u201d and \u201cLikes by Association.\u201d \n\nWhen selecting your Facebook targeting, you will encounter broad keywords like \u201cCoffee.\u201d Broad keywords like this will target a huge range of people, plenty of which don\u2019t actually like coffee, because of \u201cforced likes\u201d and \u201clikes by association.\u201d \n\nFor example, you may not like coffee, but you might click like on a post your friend made about drinking a great cup of coffee because you like your friend and like that they are enjoying it. Because you clicked like on a status related to coffee, you\u2019ve now sent a signal to Facebook to include you in this broad targeting. \n\nTo avoid this, look for keywords that are targeted. You can identify targeted ones by selecting long-tail keywords and keywords with lowercase letters that don\u2019t use any uppercase letters. \n\n#6 Of Our Facebook Ad Tips: Focus on the Important Information in Your Facebook Analytics Account \n\nInside your analytics account, Facebook gives you a lot of data, a lot of it is unhelpful. Focus on these 4 metrics when analyzing if a product is performing well and create your own custom column of data to analyze: \n\n1) Cost per purchase (CPP)\n2) Cost per click link (CPM)\n3) Click through rate link (CTR)\n4) Cost per miles (CPM)","publishedAt":"2017-08-23T23:30:00Z","tags":["facebook ads","aliexpress facebook ads","dropshipping","dropshipping ads","facebook ad tips","facebook free shipping dropshipping","free plus shipping","fred lam","conversion pixel","facebook objective"],"title":"6 Facebook Ad Tips for Aliexpress Dropshipping Stores","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hkL3vu8PR2g\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hkL3vu8PR2g\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hkL3vu8PR2g\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hkL3vu8PR2g\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hkL3vu8PR2g\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M49S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"283","dislikeCount":"99","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5023","viewCount":"133335"}},{"id":"pAOQjDNka90","snippet":{"description":"When working with Chinese suppliers, there are 2 major Chinese cultural quirks you need to know about when importing from China.\n\u25ba\u25ba Get our free ebook - How to Make $10,000\/Month with Dropshipping: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step \n\u25ba\u25ba Watch our video - Importing from China: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wFSqwNZDixQ\n\nWhen working with Chinese suppliers and importing from China, there are two major cultural quirks and differences that you need to know about. These cultural differences can cause a lot of problems and can sometimes result in our cultures being at odds against each other: \n\n* They can result in delays.\n* They can cause communication mishaps\/breakdowns. \n* They can result in low-quality orders. \n* And they can impact the price you can successfully negotiate with your supplier. Instead of getting the lowest possible price you can could, you end up paying a higher price.  \n\nCultural Quirk #1 when Importing from China: Mianzi (i.e. Face) \n\nIn China there is a concept called Mianzi. The word Mianzi roughly translates to honor in English. It is the concept of \u201chaving face.\u201d It is a complex element on their culture and it can make or break business deals.\n\nIn Western countries, we use the phrase \u201closing face\u201d a lot - it means that someone was embarrassed. It a phrase that we adopted from China. In Western nations, no one likes to lose face, but the results of it are much more severe in China. \n\nThe reason for this is that Chinese society is built on a strong hierarchal system. People expected to be treated a particular way based on their standing in their hierarchy. \n\nSomething else to keep in mind is that, in China, if you cause someone to lose face, it is not just them that is humiliated and embarrassed - you are too. If you cause someone to lose face by embarrassing them, then people will potentially view you as a \u201cdangerous\u201d individual to interact with, since if you caused one person to lose face, then your disregard for social norms means you will likely cause others to lose face - with makes you risky to interact with. It can cause you to be socially ostracized. \n\nWhen it comes to working with Chinese suppliers, if you want to keep communication lines open, then you should avoid doing anything that would cause this. Here are 2 tips: \n\nTip #1: Avoid saying no\n\nIn China, individuals and businesses will avoid saying \u201cno\u201d as this is considered embarrassing to both parties and would cause both to lose face. Instead of saying \u201cno\u201d suppliers will give you answers like \u201cmaybe\u201d - which essentially is a polite way of saying no.\n\nTip #2: Avoid getting angry \n\nIf you encounter something frustrating with your supplier, sending an angry email is not going to help the situation - it is going to hurt it. Try to keep your communication with them positive. If you get angry, you risk having them avoid you. \n\nHere are 2 tips for helping people gain face and thus increasing communication and trust between you and your supplier:\n\nTip #1: Complement regularly\n\nCompliments are expected when doing business, so if given the opportunity compliment both your contact you are working with and the company itself. \n\nTip #2: Exaggerate a little \n\nIn Chinese culture, \u201cgreat\u201d means \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d means \u201cokay\u201d and \u201cokay\u201d means not OK. This is because in communication, people exaggerate as a compliment to others. Try to keep this in mind when communicating with your supplier. \n\nCultural Quirk #2 when Importing from China: Guanxi - i.e. Relationships \n\nIn English, the word \u201cguanxi\u201d roughly translates to \u201crelationship.\u201d It is another complex yet important element to Chinese culture, and it results in business deals being handled very differently to how we handle them in the West. \n\nIn Western countries, we tend to choose our business relationships\/partnerships based on who will give us the best ROI. If we were looking for a manufacturer, we would go to each supplier, get proposals and quotes, and select the best supplier based off of that data. \n\nIn China it is extremely common to choose your business partnerships based off previous relationships as priority is given to contacts you have built guanxi with. Building guanxi doesn\u2019t just involve having successful business relationships with someone: it involves building a personal relationship with them. \n\nIf you try to build this with your contact at your factory, you\u2019ll have a much easier time negotiating prices, deals and contracts. Here are 3 tips to help you do that: \n\nTip #1: If you get the chance, try to talk to your contact about more than just business.\n\nTip #2: Try to open conversations with small talk.\n\nTip #3: Avoid negative language so that you don\u2019t cause them to lose face. \n\nIf you have any questions, please be sure to leave them in the comments section.","publishedAt":"2017-08-14T14:00:06Z","tags":["chinese culture","chinese suppliers","importing from China","mianzi","guanxi","chinese manufacturers","chinese business","business with china","losing face","having face","China"],"title":"2 MAJOR Cultural Quirks When Importing from China (Mianzi & Guanxi)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pAOQjDNka90\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pAOQjDNka90\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pAOQjDNka90\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"43","dislikeCount":"3","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"397","viewCount":"10480"}},{"id":"GI6mW1wyol4","snippet":{"description":"We give you 8 side jobs to make money.

In this video, we\u2019re going to discuss 5 things you need to know before launching private label Amazon FBA products.\n\n***OTHER LINKS DISCUSSED IN THIS VIDEO***\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Get ZonPages: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/zonpages (SAVE 15% WITH EXCLUSIVE COUPON CODE \u201cWHOLESALE\u201d) \n\u25ba\u25ba Jungle Scout 2017 tutorial: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8rMIW8zKptI \n\u25ba\u25ba Jungle Scout 2016 tutorial: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6MhEPyWKE-U \n\u25ba\u25ba How to Find Suppliers: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WTZFMEDyvYk \n\u25ba\u25ba Get Jungle Send: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/jumpsend\n\n#1: The Most Important Thing to the Amazon Algorithm is Sales\n\nThere are several factors that make up the Amazon search algorithm such as conversions, reviews and list relevancy. But the most important, number 1 factor, is sales. What Amazon wants to see is that your sales match (or beat) your top ranked competitor for your chosen keyword. \n\nLaunching private label products is a unique business model, as most digital businesses are built on paid traffic.\n\nMatching your top competitor when you just launch can be challenging, but there is a quick \u201ccheat\u201d method to help you do so - product giveaways. This is when you create a discount coupon code that discounts an item down to just 99 cents. You then give this coupon away to people. When they use the coupon to buy the item, it counts as a sale. \n\n#2: Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Spend Money to Make Money\n\nThe most successful sellers who are launching private label products on Amazon FBA aren\u2019t afraid to spend money because they know they\u2019ll make it back in organic sales. Product giveaways are expensive, but they have big rewards from the organic traffic gain from ranking your product fast in the Amazon search engine.\n\n#3: The Minimum Order Quantity Isn\u2019t Always the Best\n\nWhen launching private label products on Amazon FBA, if you can start with the minimum order quantity from a supplier, then this is the best thing to do because it minimizes your risk. But sometimes, the minimum order quantity isn\u2019t enough to match the demand from your buyers. \n\nThis is especially important if you are going to run a product giveaway to match your competitors sales velocity. You need to check how many sales they are making every week, and ensure that you have enough inventory to match those sales. \n\n#4: Be VERY Careful with Price Competition\n\nOne marketing strategy when launching private label products on Amazon FBA is price. It\u2019s not a bad thing, but it\u2019s an advanced technique most new FBA private labellers should stay away from:\n\n1) You risk getting into a pricing war. You lower your price, so your competitor lowers their price, so you lower your price. The only person that wins in a pricing war is the customer.\n\n2) It\u2019s often unnecessary. Your competitors in the market have already tested the prices for you, and have found what is called \u201cmarket equilibrium.\u201d This is when the price matches the demand.\n\n3) You risk losing sales because of perceived value. Lowering the price psychologically lowers the value of your item. \n\nThe safest place to price your items is somewhere in the middle. Not the most expensive, not the cheapest - somewhere in the middle. \n\n#5: Follow Up Emails are KEY for Getting Reviews \n\nReviews are key for launching private label products on Amazon FBA. To get reviews you need to send emails. If you don\u2019t follow up with the customer, your conversion rates can be as low as 2-3%. But a simple 3-email sequence can bump it up to over 10%. \n\nHere is a good 3-email sequence to follow when launching private label products on Amazon FBA: \n\n1) Send the first email to the customer when their order is shipped. This builds anticipation and it also shows that you care about them as a customer since you are keeping them informed. \n\n2) Send the second email a couple of days after the product has been delivered. Ask them to please leave a review. Another important thing to ask is for them to email you if they are having problems before they leave feedback. This should stop most negative reviews.\n\n3) Finally, send them the first email a week after the product has been delivered. Ask them to leave a review, and tell them it would mean a lot to you if they did. It is also important to ask them to contact you if they are having any issues before leaving feedback.\n\nRemember: it is against the terms of service to ask for a positive review. But it is not against the Amazon terms of service to ask for an honest review!","publishedAt":"2017-09-29T20:33:46Z","tags":["launching private label amazon fba products","laughing private label products","launching amazon fba products","private label amazon fba","private label amazon","private label","private labelling","jumpsend","zonblast","amazon reviews","amazon product giveaways","amazon coupons","amazon product coupons","amazon sales velocity","ranking amazon search engine","amazon search engine"],"title":"Launching Private Label Amazon FBA Products: 5 Things You Need to Know","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JWlXVaGMXmE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JWlXVaGMXmE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JWlXVaGMXmE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JWlXVaGMXmE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JWlXVaGMXmE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M29S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"44","dislikeCount":"7","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"875","viewCount":"17696"}},{"id":"AaQJxbAID00","snippet":{"description":"Is Amazon FBA Private Labeling dead?

These tips will have you increase your conversion rates - which will help you make more money from dropshipping! \n\nTip #1 to Make More Money from a Shopify Aliexpress Dropshipping Store: Add Enhanced Ecommerce Google Analytics Settings to your Store \n\nIt\u2019s very easy to add Enhanced Ecommerce Google Analytics to a Shopify store. And there are numerous benefits to doing this:\n\n* It lets you track through Google Analytics if a customer adds a product to their cart.\n* It lets you track what products a user clicks on.\n* It lets you track successful transactions.\n* Plus tonnes more - it basically lets you track a user as they move through your Aliexpress Shopify store. \n\nWhy add Enhanced Ecommerce Google Analytics? Simple: it let\u2019s you make educated decisions. For example, if you see through the data that you have an unusually high cart abandonment at the shipping page, then you know that it\u2019s the shipping price turning customers off and you need to lower it. \n\nTip #2 to Make More Money from a Shopify Aliexpress Dropshipping Store: Be Smart - and Not Greedy - When Pricing Your Upsells \n\nIt\u2019s very easy to add upsells to a Shopify store using plugins - and these upsells are crucial in greatly increasing the Average Order Value (AOV) and money you make for each of your customers. \n\nBUT - upsells can backfire if you charge too much. You risk offending the customer and turning them off your upsell\u2026 or worse, risk offending them so much that they bounce from the cart and don\u2019t buy anything - effectively losing you a sale. \n\nTo stop this, here are some guidelines to follow when you are pricing your upsells: \n\n1) The first upsell should cost no more than double the price of the first item they purchase.\n\nThis means that if the first item is $9.95, then the first upsell should cost no more than $19.95. \n\n2) The second upsell should cost no more than double the price of the first upsell. \n\nSo if the first upsell costs $19.95, then the second upsell should cost no more than $39.95. \n\nAnd here is another tip - don\u2019t add in too many upsells. If you add in too many, you will risk offending the customer. A good number to stick to is 2. \n\nTip #3 to Make More Money from a Shopify Aliexpress Dropshipping Store: Use Proven Copywriting Techniques to Increase Your Sales\n\nWriting your product description is very important, and it can make or break a sale. If you have a great product, but a terrible page for it, you will struggle to make sales. Copywriting is a secondary but important skill to learn as a dropshipper. Here are 3 things to keep in mind when writing good copy for your products: \n\n1) Sell the Benefits and NOT the Features \n\nThis is a classic mistake that most new marketers make. They list the features for a product, thinking the customer will be impressed - but this doesn\u2019t work. You need to explain how this product is going to benefit and improve the customer's life. \n\n2) Use Powerful Words in your Product Page\n\nUse words that evoke emotions and feelings. For example, if you want to create scarcity, use words and phrases like \u201cnever again\u201d, \u201crunning out\u201d and \u201cwhile they last.\u201d \n\n3) Remember - the Headline is EXTREMELY Important \n\nMost people make the mistake of making the headline just the name of whatever product they are selling. This works, but what works even BETTER is to craft a unique, high-converting headline by utilizing powerful words to evoke emotions in the customer. \n\nTip #4 to Make More Money from a Shopify Aliexpress Dropshipping Store: Use Amazon.com to Help You Write Your Product Pages\n\nSomething I\u2019ve noticed - and this applies to me as well - is that dropshippers are often very good with numbers\u2026 and less good when it comes to words. Our strengths lie in analyzing data, not in writing copy. \n\nIf this is you, then that\u2019s OK. You don\u2019t need to be creative and come up with your own ideas - look at what others are doing for inspiration. Amazon.com is a great place to do this as a lot of people are (foolishly) dropshipping Aliexpress products on the site. You can go to their listings and use them for inspiration when writing your own. And a bonus tip, don\u2019t just look at the product listing. Go into the reviews and see what customers like about the product - and use that to help you write your description too.","publishedAt":"2017-09-11T23:00:01Z","tags":["shopify aliexpress store","shopify store","aliexpress store","shopify optimization","aliexpress optimization","aliexpress dropshipping","aliexpress dropshipping optimization","making money from shopify","making money from aliexpress","aliexpress","shopify","make more money"],"title":"How to Make More Money from a Shopify Aliexpress Store (4 Optimization Tips)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yFMPAu_m1nA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yFMPAu_m1nA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yFMPAu_m1nA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yFMPAu_m1nA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yFMPAu_m1nA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M15S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"101","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1835","viewCount":"38679"}},{"id":"PjyQ9ffydv4","snippet":{"description":"What makes the most money and is the better...

You only purchase products after the customer has bought them. In addition, the fulfillment costs are low - usually $10 an item, which means you don\u2019t need a lot of cash-on hand to start making sales.\n\nInstead, your main expenses come from having a store ($29\/month with Shopify, and as low as $35.88\/year with Woocommerce) and from the advertising (which costs around $21\/product to test). \n\nAmazon FBA on the other hand requires you purchase the products you are private labeling in bulk - which means you have much higher upfront costs. It costs around $1,000 to start and launch an average Amazon FBA business. \n\nWINNER: Dropshipping\n\nWhich is Passive - Amazon FBA vs. Dropshipping \n\nDropshipping requires that you check every day for orders and that you fulfill them. There are manual processes involved. You can hire out the work to a VA once you\u2019re successful but in the beginning you\u2019ll need to do it yourself.\n\nWith Amazon FBA private labeling all of the work is upfront. Once the products have been shipped into the Amazon FBA warehouses, they take care of most of the work for you - including fulfillment - and it makes it very passive.\n\nWINNER: Amazon FBA private labeling\n\nWhat Makes the Most Money - Amazon FBA vs. Dropshipping \n\nIt\u2019s a lot easier to scale to big, fast products with dropshipping because you don\u2019t have to wait to manufacture inventory. You can scale up if you have the ability to test lots of products.\n\nAmazon FBA takes longer, because you need to manufacture your inventory in-advance. In addition, you have less ability to capture customers contact details. When you are dropshipping you can remarket to the customer over and over again.\n\nWINNER: Dropshipping\n\nWhich Has the Least Risk - Amazon FBA vs. Dropshipping \n\nWith dropshipping, you need to test lots of different products to find a winner. On average it tends to be that for every 20 products you test you\u2019ll find 1 winning item - but there are no guarantees. \n\nWith Amazon FBA private labeling, you are selecting products using data from tools like Jungle Scout. You can see how many sales are being made, how well your competitors listings are optimized and you can use that data to select successful products. You can also follow a proven launch formula to rise your listing to the top of the Amazon search results. \n\nWINNER: Amazon FBA private labeling\n\nWhich is the Best for Free Traffic - Amazon FBA vs. Dropshipping \n\nWhen dropshipping in your own store, you can take advantage of free search engine optimization (SEO) traffic. However, it is slow. It takes a long time for Google to rise your listing to the top of the search results. For competitive keywords, you will also need to spend time\/money on backlinks, which is tricky. Optimizing meta data isn\u2019t enough for competitive keywords.\n\nWith Amazon FBA private labeling, your main source of sales is going to be the Amazon search results. The Amazon search engine is a lot easier to manipulate than the Google search engine. \n\nWINNER: Amazon FBA private labeling\n\nWhich is Best for Paid Traffic - Amazon FBA vs. Dropshipping \n\nDropshipping is a great match for paid traffic, because you don\u2019t have to worry about manufacturing products. You have access to all of the products in the Aliexpress catalog. You can immediately go and start creating ads for them.\n\nIf you have a successful product you are private labeling on Amazon, then you should definitely run paid ads to it. However, you have a bottleneck where you have to go and produce\/manufacture a new product and ship it into the Amazon warehouse before you can run more ads. If you like paid traffic and want to utilize it to it\u2019s fullest, dropshipping works best.\n\nWINNER: Dropshipping\n\nIt\u2019s a tie! The moral is that both business models have their advantages\/disadvantages.

Here is how to overcome these obstacles when creating your Aliexpress dropshipping store. \n\n#1: How to Not Get Banned on PayPal\n\nEveryone has heard the horror stories of people having their PayPal accounts banned and losing tens of thousands of dollars. It\u2019s key when dropshipping to avoid having your PayPal account being banned. \n\nA lot of people say that PayPal \u201cdoesn\u2019t like dropshipping\u201d - but this simply isn\u2019t true. What PayPal doesn\u2019t like is it\u2019s customers being lied to or tricked to. \n\nAnd we regularly see new dropshippers being shady when it comes to one thing in particular\u2026 the long shipping times. \n\nNew dropshippers assume that they\u2019ll need to not be honest when it comes to the shipping times to make sales. But this isn\u2019t true. Long shipping times don\u2019t affect conversion rates as much as you\u2019d think - what they do affect is how much customer support you need to provide.\n\nIt is very important that you are upfront with customers and set their expectations clearly in the beginning, because this is the biggest reason for PayPal disputes - and it is PayPal disputes that will get your account frozen and banned. \n\nHere is what we recommend you do to be upfront about the long shipping times:\n\n1) Add a disclaimer that shipping will take 2-4 weeks in the product page, and BOLD it.\n2) Add a disclaimer in the customer confirmation email. Be clear it will be 2-4 weeks before it arrives and to please be patient. \n\nBeing honest is the key to winning PayPal disputes. Losing disputes is how your account will be banned, and your money frozen. \n\n#2: How to Avoid Getting Chargebacks \n\nCredit card companies allow customers to do a chargeback if they have been the victim of a fraudulent transaction. If you are shown to have fraudulently charged them, that is very serious.\n\nThere are two main reasons that customers claim chargebacks on Aliexpress dropshipping stores:\n\n1) They don\u2019t recognize the transaction on their credit card statement.\n2) They are unhappy about something - usually the long shipping times. \n\nThe first is very easy to avoid. If you are using Shopify, when setting up Shopify Payments, make sure you have the name of your store in the Statement Descriptor box. \n\nThe second is trickier. Again, you\u2019ll get a LOT less chargebacks if you are upfront and honest with the customer about them. Be sure to set the expectation up front. \n\nBut no matter what - any business that is dealing with credit cards should be expecting chargebacks. That is another reason why it\u2019s very important to be upfront with the customer from the beginning with shipping times. If you were upfront, then you should easily win as you can provide proof they knew what they were purchasing:\n\n* You can link them to your product page with your clear disclaimer.\n* You can provide screenshots of the page with the disclaimer.\n* You can send a copy of the customer confirmation email, outlining shipping times.\n\nIn addition, if you use ePacket as your shipping option (which we strongly recommend) you\u2019ll have a tracking number you can provide to show the package is on-route to the customer. \n\nBut no matter what, chargebacks are a paid. So there is something else I strongly recommend that you do\u2026\n\nYou encourage communication between you and the customer. In your follow-up emails, stress that if they are having any problems, to please contact you immediately. This way, you talk to and calm any upset customers before they attempt to do a PayPal dispute or a chargeback. \n#3: How to Handle Refunds when Aliexpress Dropshipping \n\nWe strongly recommend that you have a strict refund policy in place that only allows refunds for items that are faulty or broken. Do not allow refunds for people that have simply changed their minds.\n\nIn addition, protect yourself by creating a page that has your refund policy on it, and link to it in the store footer. That way, it will be on every page in your store so customers don\u2019t have an excuse for not having read it. \n\nRemember: there are solutions to every challenge and every stumbling block. With research and common sense, you can overcome anything. Successful, rich individuals see these challenges as opportunities.

Will customers be willing to wait?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy will people buy items with long shipping times from China if you can buy an item with fast shipping from Amazon?\u201d \n\n***Long Shipping Times DON\u2019T STOP Customers from Buying*** \n\nIf you are worried that the long shipping times from China when dropshipping with Aliexpress are going to stop customers from buying, and hurt your conversion rates\u2026 don\u2019t be. This has been extensively tested. While it impacts the conversion rates a little, it doesn\u2019t impact them by much. \n\nAnd the lower conversion rates are usually offset by the high profit margins on items shipped from China. \n\nIf you have delayed creating your store because of this then STOP WORRYING because it DOESN\u2019T MATTER!\n\nSelling on Amazon is very different to selling in an Aliexpress dropshipping store, which is why you can\u2019t compare the two.\n\nOn Amazon, customers primarily find items by using the search bar. They know what they want to buy and they are now comparing the different items to sell. It is a methodical process of comparing products. Customers will compare features, prices and shipping times when making their decision. \n\nIf you build an Aliexpress dropshipping store right, people won\u2019t be buying items because they have already decided to. Instead, they\u2019ll be buying products from you because of emotions. Your goal should be to pick products that when the right person see\u2019s it, it makes them feel something:\n\n\u201cI really really love that!\u201d\n\n\u201cWOW - I need to buy that!\u201d \n\nYou aren\u2019t trying to sell them items that they are already decided to buy. You are trying to sell them items that had not planned to buy, but once they see an ad for it, have a strong desire to buy because it appeals perfectly for them. \n\nIn addition, you can use scarcity in your product ad and description to make the buyer feel like they are getting a great deal, so they won\u2019t look at prices elsewhere. \n\n***How to Overcome Downsides from Long Shipping Times***\n\nThere is a downside to long shipping times from China when dropshipping with Aliexpress - and that is customer service. While it doesn\u2019t stop customers from buying, you will get an increase in emails from customers enquiring as to where their item is. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid or worried about this. When most customers email you, they just want a nice reply from someone who lets them know that it\u2019s normal their item hasn\u2019t arrived yet and that it will be there - they just need to be patient. As long as customers feel like you are real and care about them, you will calm them with excellent customer support. \n\nRarely, you\u2019ll get customers that will demand a refund. As long as you put a shipping disclaimer in your product copy, you do not owe them a refund. If they try and do a PayPal claim or a chargeback, you will win the dispute. That is why it is important to be upfront and honest about the shipping times. I recommend you bold this so customers don\u2019t miss it. \n\n***What is the Best Way to Ship from Aliexpress?***\n\nI recommend you use ePacket exclusively when you dropship from China to the USA with Aliexpress. \n\nEpacket is a heavily discounted shipping option that is run at a loss. It is a shipping treaty between China and the USA to encourage customers in the USA to purchase more items from China. Shipments arrive within 10-20 days (2-3 weeks) and are extremely cheap, usually costing between $1-2 extra at most. \n\nIn addition, ePacket includes tracking, so that you can see if a customer's item was truly lost in the mail, or if it was successfully delivered. \n\nThis is also why I suggest you stick to suppliers based in the USA. The ePacket shipping option is different from other ePacket options offered to other countries (like Canada, UK, Australia & NZ). That is because the USA ePacket is run by the United States Postal Service, whereas the ePacket option offered to other countries is run by Hong Kong Post. \n\nThe USA ePacket shipping is extremely efficient and works great - which is why I recommend sticking to the USA in the beginning and expanding out from there. \n\nSo if you\u2019ve been letting the long shipping times from China stop you from opening an Aliexpress dropshipping store, don\u2019t: it doesn\u2019t matter!","publishedAt":"2017-10-11T22:00:02Z","tags":["aliexpress long shipping times","long shipping times from china","aliexpress dropshipping","aliexpress dropshipping shipping","epacket","aliexpress epacket","aliexpress","shipping from china","dropshipping from china"],"title":"Why LONG SHIPPING Times DON\u2019T MATTER when Dropshipping with Aliexpress (ePacket China Shipping)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sBuiN-CVxE4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sBuiN-CVxE4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sBuiN-CVxE4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sBuiN-CVxE4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sBuiN-CVxE4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M7S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"422","dislikeCount":"128","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5179","viewCount":"151592"}},{"id":"fKSalHjKhjc","snippet":{"description":"(Begins at 0:14) How to pick Aliexpress products that earn over a MILLION DOLLARS in a year.\n\u25ba\u25ba GET ZERO UP HERE: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/zeroup\n\u25ba\u25ba How to Make $10k\/month Dropshipping: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step \n\nIn this live video, we're going to be discussing...\n\n1) Actual products that millionaire dropshipper Fred Lam has been selling for the past 12 months that have collectively earned him over 6 million dollars.\n\n2) What made those products winners - why are some products super profitable (and others aren't)?\n\n3) How Fred tests products using Facebook ads to identify these super-profitable items. \n\n4) How Fred uses funnels & upsells to massively scale his products and drastically increase his AOV (average order value) - as in, get customers to spend lots, lots more money!","publishedAt":"2017-10-05T01:06:03Z","tags":null,"title":"How to Pick Products that Make Over a MILLION DOLLARS in a YEAR with Aliexpress Dropshipping","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKSalHjKhjc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKSalHjKhjc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKSalHjKhjc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT30M2S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"600","dislikeCount":"161","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8113","viewCount":"302267"}},{"id":"bwkNpNX94eU","snippet":{"description":"Learn the 3 weird dropshipping hacks that make money with Aliexpress dropshipping.\n\u25ba\u25ba Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba Video interview with Fred (who taught me hack #2): https:\/\/youtu.be\/fKSalHjKhjc \n\nDropshipping hack #1: Facebook Video Demo Ads \n\nWhen we teach most people how to set up a dropshipping store, we recommend that they get started with image ads. Not because image ads perform the best, but because people are less intimidated by them. It\u2019s the pathway of least resistance.\n\nIf you are willing to put in effort and create a video ad, Facebook will reward you with very cheap advertising, which will greatly improve your conversions. \n\nYou can create simple videos by taking the images your suppliers have provided and putting text over them. Even better though, is to create a video demo ad. This is when you take a video of you\/someone else using the product in-action. To do it, all you need is the product yourself, and a camera - a smartphone will be fine for this. You don\u2019t need a professional camera.\n\nAs an example, in this video Sarah created a simple video demo ad of an item that we\u2019ve featured regularly on this channel: the self-stir mug. The video Sarah replicated had amassed over 9 million views on Facebook over its ad campaign. It was very easy and took less than a minute to film and set up. \n\nDropshipping Hack #2: Change Ad Budgets Just After Midnight\n\nThe Facebook algorithm is very smart - which is why it is very easy for newbies to have success with Facebook ads. The algorithm works to try to put your ad in front of the right people that are most likely to convert and purchase your products. It also tries to figure out how to best use your ad budget across the day. \n\nSo if you go to scale your campaign by raising the ad budget midway through the day, it disrupts the algorithm. Normally, the algorithm spends your daily budget across the whole day, testing to see what times of the day people are most interacting with your ad and converting. If you change the ad budget midway through the day, Facebook scrambles to try and spend your new advertising budget by the end of the day. That means that it doesn\u2019t get to test it across a whole 24-hour period, so it spends it inefficiently - and thus collects inefficient data, negatively impacting your campaign.\n\nThe solution is to increase your ad budget just after midnight. This way, the Facebook algorithm has the entire day to test the ad budget and collect accurate data. \n\nHowever - not everyone wants to stay up until midnight just to update their ad budgets (I understand that!). What you can do is when you create your Business Manager account in Facebook, set your timezone to be one that is ahead of you. For example, if you live in California, you would be on Pacific Time. You could set your timezone to be Eastern Time, so that it would be 3 hours ahead. That means you could update your ad budgets at 9pm instead of midnight. \n\nDropshipping Hack #3: Sell Digital Products to Your Customers\n\nMost dropshippers don\u2019t even think about selling digital products like ebooks\/videos etc. They only think about selling physical products to their customers. This is a big mistake though, as digital products can have HUGE profit margins since they have less overhead costs, which means that merchants for digital products often pay out generous commissions. \n\nWhat this means is that you can dropship physical products from Aliexpress as a way to collect email leads. You then send out emails to those customers promoting digital products. In this video, Sarah gives the example of Numerology.com - they have custom destiny readings that they sell to customers after they have received a small, free destiny reading based on their date of birth. \n\nThis funnel (a free report into a paid, in-depth report) converts very highly. In addition, they offer 65% commissions. So if you were dropshipping products related to Astrology, you could send follow-up emails to your customers recommending that they get a free destiny reading from Numerology.com and redirect them there with your affiliate link. This would be very profitable! \n\nSo don\u2019t think that you can only sell your dropshipping customers physical products. Check to see if there are any good affiliate programs in your niche for digital products and take advantage of the big commission rates (plus you won\u2019t have to worry about shipping out the items\/fulfilling the orders either!).","publishedAt":"2017-11-28T23:00:03Z","tags":["dropshipping","dropshipping hacks","make money","make money with dropshipping","facebook","facebook ads","facebook ad tricks","facebook ad tips","dropshipping facebook","facebook videos","facebook video ads","affiliate marketing","affiliates","dropship","dropshippers","Aliexpress","aliexpress dropshipping"],"title":"Weird Dropshipping HACKS that Make Money [Facebook Ad Tricks]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwkNpNX94eU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwkNpNX94eU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwkNpNX94eU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwkNpNX94eU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwkNpNX94eU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"447","dislikeCount":"71","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6722","viewCount":"173394"}},{"id":"354un7k-Ti0","snippet":{"description":"VIDEO STARTS AT 0:18.

Some of the policy changes were good for sellers\u2026 but some weren\u2019t so good - so it\u2019s crucial you know what they are.\n\nChange #1: Amazon no longer offer a free Pro Seller Account trial \n\nIn the past, Amazon offer a free 30-day trial for a Pro Seller Account (which usually costs $39.99 a month). This was fantastic for new sellers on a limited budget. However, this year Amazon quietly got rid of this. You now need to pay for a monthly membership upfront. \n\nIf you are on a limited budget, you can still create a free account by opening an Individual Seller account. However, we don\u2019t recommend that you do this, because to be eligible for the Amazon Buy Box, you need to have a Professional account. And as the Buy Box accounts for about 80% of all sales on Amazon, it\u2019s crucial that every seller be eligible for the Buy Box. \n\nChange #2: Amazon has opened in Australia! \n\nAfter a long wait, Amazon have finally opened in Australia (Amazon.com.au). At the time of filming this video, it is invitation only. That means that unless Amazon has invited you to sell on the site, you cannot become a seller yet. However, they are planning on opening it up for new sellers ASAP. \n\nAmazon also plan to open an FBA warehouse in Australia, although at the time of filming this video it had not been opened yet. The first Australia FBA warehouse will be in Melbourne.\n\nA common question we get asked here at Wholesale Ted is whether people based in the UK should sell on Amazon.co.uk rather than Amazon.com etc. The answer to this is that Amazon.com is and always will be the biggest marketplace, so if you want to make the most money you need to sell on there: but if you find the idea of importing to the USA to be intimidating and it\u2019s stopping you from getting started, begin by selling locally. \n\nChange #3: Amazon didn\u2019t restrict new sellers over Christmas\n\nLast year, Amazon restricted new FBA sellers over Christmas time. They could not send in any packages to an Amazon FBA warehouse between October 10-December 19th, and they did not give any warning in-advance. They did this to manage inventory over the Christmas period.\n\nThis year, they did not choose to restrict new sellers. Instead, they did something else to manage inventory over Christmas.\n\nChange #4: Amazon increased 4th quarter storage fees AGAIN\n\nTo help manage inventory over the 4th quarter when the Amazon FBA warehouses get overloaded, Amazon chose to once again increase storage fees. On the flipside they reduce fees per sale to encourage you to make as many sales as you can. \n\nChange #5: Automatic refunds for 3rd party sellers \n\nIn the past, Amazon allowed 3rd party sellers to require buyers contact them first before getting a refund. It meant that oftentimes, 3rd party sellers could provide customer support to the customer, and save the sale. \n\nNow, Amazon has implemented a new policy that means customers from 3rd party sellers have the exact same refund policy as if they were buying straight from an Amazon FBA seller. This means they can print off a return address and get a refund immediately. This has increased the number of refunds 3rd party sellers are getting. \n\nTo help minimize refunds, add in an email marketing campaign that is sent out after the sale encouraging buyers to contact you if they are having any problems. \n\nChange #6: No more price refunds \n\nIn the past, Amazon allowed customers to claim a refund on the difference in price if it had changed within 30 days. Amazon then changed it so that customers had 7 days to claim the refund. Now, they have removed it altogether. This is great news for sellers!\n\n3 Ways we expect Amazon to change in the future:\n\n* We expect Amazon to favour FBA sellers more and more. This is because Amazon is very good at fulfilling orders which keeps customers happy. If you\u2019re a 3rd party seller, make sure you\u2019ve got your fulfillment process up to scratch.\n\n* We expect Amazon to keep making it easier for customers to get refunds, even if it costs sellers money. Be sure to sell items that have decent profit margins (at least 30%) to allow for any increased costs of selling.\n\n* We expect Amazon to keep making it harder to get started selling on the site. That is why we have always recommended and always will that if you want to open an Amazon store\u2026\n\n\u2026 That you do so ASAP. The sooner you do it, the easier it will be!\n\nQuestions?

For legal advice, please contact a lawyer. \n\nQuestion 1: Will you get sued if you use product images from Aliexpress suppliers? \n\nThe answer to this is almost certainly no. In China, the culture around copyright is very different to the western world. In China, the culture around copyright is that if something can be easily copied and can benefit others, then that is more important than protecting the rights of a single individual. It is a cultural difference.\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s very easy to get away with piracy in China, which is why pirated movies\/music\/games are sold freely on the streets. In fact, Chinese manufacturers copy each other all the time. Not only do they produce the same products, they steal images from each other. If you go to Aliexpress you will see that different manufacturers are producing the same items, and they are using the same images.\n\nAs a result, it is extremely unlikely that any Aliexpress supplier would try to pursue you in court for any copyright issues. If they were going to sue anyone - it would be the manufacturers that are copying them - although due to the cultural differences, that is also extremely unlikely. \n\nIf you\u2019re still worried, you can contact the Aliexpress suppliers and ask them if they are OK with you reusing their images. \n\nQuestion 2: How Can I Avoid Being Sued for Copyright Images?\n\nThey might not care in China if you copy images - but in the west, they sure do! Even if your website is not making any money, you can still be pursued legally and sued for using images without permission - so it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t use copyrighted images on your website! \n\nA good place to find images you can use is with Google Images:\n\n1) Go to Google Images\n2) Click settings.\n3) Click advanced search.\n4) Type in what you\u2019re searching for.\n5) Scroll down to usage rights. Select \u201cfree to use, share or modify, even commercially.\u201d\n6) Click search. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many images you\u2019re allowed to use!  \n\nSo don\u2019t get lazy and use images that are copyrighted. Use Google to find free images you\u2019re allowed to use. \n\nQuestion 3: Can I Sell Aliexpress Products that are Trademarked? \n\nNo - do NOT sell products that are trademarked. For example, in the video, Sarah compares two items - one that is a generic self-stir mug, and one that is a self-stir mug with Harry Potter imagery on it. Do NOT sell the Harry Potter mug, as it is illegal.\n\nIf you sell products with trademarks, you aren\u2019t just risking getting sued - you\u2019re risking having legal action taken against you.","publishedAt":"2017-12-14T23:00:00Z","tags":["sued when dropshipping","dropshipping sued","getting sued","sued","sued copyright images","sued trademarked images","using aliexpress supplier images","using dropshipper images","aliexpress","aliexpress dropshipping","trademarked images","copyright images"],"title":"How to Not Get SUED When Dropshipping (w\/ Aliexpress & Shopify)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DtEkAyKapds\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DtEkAyKapds\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DtEkAyKapds\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DtEkAyKapds\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DtEkAyKapds\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M19S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"627","dislikeCount":"163","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6266","viewCount":"222673"}},{"id":"66eeFdjzsQU","snippet":{"description":"Learn the 7 things you need to do BEFORE launching on Amazon with FBA.\n\u25ba\u25ba DOWNLOAD: Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba WATCH: How to Launch Your First Product: https:\/\/youtu.be\/JPwscpE-53g \n\n***Other Links Mentioned in this Video***\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Sales Tax Obligations: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P9aBe9sFWJs\n\u25ba\u25ba Get Jungle Scout: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/junglescout (affiliate link)\n\u25ba\u25ba Get Jump Send: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/jumpsend (affiliate link)\n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Have a Launch Plan to Get Sales\n\nOn Amazon, the vast majority of sales come through people typing in items they want to purchase into the search bar and then picking an item to buy from the list. That is why if you want your product to sell well on Amazon, you need to have a plan for how your listing is going to get on the first page of results. \n\nThe most important factor for how Amazon chooses which items go there is something called \u201csales velocity.\u201d They will greatly favour items that are making the most sales.\n\nWhat you need to do then is use Jungle Scout to find out how many sales your top competitor is making, and then beat them for 2 weeks. To do this, you\u2019ll need to have a plan in-place for how you\u2019ll match their sales (discount coupons are the most common strategy for this).\n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Take Incredible Photos of Your Product\n\nSales velocity is the most important factor when Amazon chooses which products to promote, but there is another - conversions. The higher your conversion rate, the more likely Amazon is to promote your products. \n\nAmazon have tested it and found that product photos are the #1 conversion factor. So get a test product sent to you and have professional photos taken of your product.\n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Get Friends & Family to Buy Your Product \n\nAnother important conversion factor is reviews. Luckily you don\u2019t need to have hundreds of reviews to make organic sales, but having a base of 10+ reviews is a good start. The easiest way to get reviews is to get your friends and family to buy your product and to then leave you a review. \n\nIn addition, get your friends and family to search for your targeted keyword on Amazon, scroll through the item listings and THEN buy your product. This will send a strong signal to Amazon that they should rank your product for that keyword.\n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Have a Plan to Get Reviews from Customers\n\nA big reason why you should get your friends\/family to leave a review is because anonymous customers rarely leave reviews. If you do not have a plan in-place to get reviews from customers, the conversion rate of purchase-to-review is less than 1%. However, if you have an email sequence in-place (Jump Send is a great way to do this) asking customers to leave a review, you can more than double your conversion rate.\n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Form a Limited Liability Company (LLC) \n\nTo starting selling on Amazon, you DON\u2019T need to legally form a company. You can start selling immediately as a sole proprietor. However, we strongly recommend that you consider forming an LLC because it protects you in-case anybody tries to sue you since it gives you \u201climited liability.\u201d What this means is that creditors can\u2019t go after you personally if your company gets sued. It isn\u2019t necessary to form an LLC, but it\u2019s the safe thing to do.\n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Have a Back-up Cash Plan\n\nWhen you sell on Amazon, you do not get paid straight away from your customers. Instead, Amazon holds your money for 2 weeks as a new seller. This means that you need to be able to pay for expenses in the meantime and not rely upon the money that you have earned as a seller on Amazon.\n\nIn particular, you want to have a plan in-place for how you will be able to pay for new inventory in-case your product starts selling well, as Amazon does not like it if you run out of stock, so you need to make sure you always have inventory in the FBA warehouses. Before you launch on Amazon then, make sure you have some way to pay for expenses (so have some cash set aside, or have a credit card). \n\nBefore Launching on Amazon - Know Your Sales Tax Obligations \n\nMake sure you read about your sales tax obligations. Even if you don\u2019t live in the United States, you may still be required to collect and pay sales tax within certain states. We have a video here on this channel which discusses what your sales tax obligations are, so that you don\u2019t get an unexpected tax bill! \n\nThanks for watching - if you have questions please leave them as a comment below.","publishedAt":"2017-12-05T23:07:32Z","tags":["launching on amazon","amazon","amazon fba","private labeling","private label","private labeling Amazon","amazon.com","sales velocity","jungle scout","jump send","amazon reviews","amazon sales","selling on amazon","amazon seller"],"title":"7 Things You Need to Do BEFORE Launching on Amazon (and selling with Amazon FBA)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/66eeFdjzsQU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/66eeFdjzsQU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/66eeFdjzsQU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/66eeFdjzsQU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/66eeFdjzsQU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"185","dislikeCount":"35","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2729","viewCount":"82887"}},{"id":"KV7MJK8XH_4","snippet":{"description":"Learn how to sell on Amazon as a BEGINNER (the 4-step system to selling on Amazon).\n\u25ba\u25ba Free 10k\/month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba How to Launch Your First Amazon FBA Product: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JPwscpE-53g","publishedAt":"2018-02-28T23:36:50Z","tags":null,"title":"How to Sell on Amazon as a BEGINNER (The 4-Step System to Selling on Amazon)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KV7MJK8XH_4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KV7MJK8XH_4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KV7MJK8XH_4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT31M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"104","dislikeCount":"16","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"853","viewCount":"24725"}},{"id":"HhNtOEjSksk","snippet":{"description":"Watch our Jungle Scout tutorial to learn how to make money on Amazon FBA with private labeling.\n\u25ba\u25ba Get Jungle Scout: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/junglescout (affiliate link)\n\u25ba\u25ba Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\nFind a supplier on Alibaba: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WTZFMEDyvYk\n\nSTEP 1: Research a List of Potential High-Profit Items\n\nUse the Jungle Scout Web App to uncover a list of products that have the potential to make money on Amazon. To do that, use the following criteria with the Product Database tool:\n\n1) They have 50 reviews or less.\n2) They are selling 300+ units a month.\n3) They have a price point between $20-$50.\n4) They weigh 2 pounds or less.\n\nThe reason why we want products that meet this criteria, is because we want to find items that are making lots of sales (300+) despite having low numbers of reviews. This is so that we will still be competitive when we launch our own product which will also have low numbers of reviews (as it will be new). \n\nThe reason we want to find items priced at $20-$50 is that when we launch our product, we want to price it at least $20 so that we have have at least a 30% profit margin after production costs\/shipping costs\/Amazon FBA fees. However, if an item is priced at more than $50 it usually indicates that it is quite expensive to manufacture, and as a beginner we don\u2019t want to have to spend too much on our start-up costs, which is why we set a maximum price point. \n\nAnd of course, the reason why we set the weight to be 2 pounds is so that we can keep shipping costs low (and profits high). \n\nSTEP 2: Pick the Best Products to Analyze\n\nOnce you\u2019ve used the Jungle Scout Web App to find products that have potential to make money on Amazon, we now need to go through the list and add products that meet a new sit of criteria to our product tracker. Here is the criteria we are looking for:\n\n1) It\u2019s not a big brand product.\n2) It won\u2019t be easy to break on transit.\n3) It won\u2019t be bulky or hard to ship.\n4) It doesn\u2019t require variations. \n\nThe reason we want to rule out items that are big brands is because, most likely, the reason why they are making lots of sales despite low numbers of reviews is because they have a lot of authority from their brand. So it\u2019s not a fair comparison to say that we could do the same if we enter the market with our unknown brand.\n\nWe want to avoid items that are made out of easy to break materials like glass. Not only would this cause loss inventory costs and refunds, but the bad feedback will hurt our product reviews and our seller statistics - which is not good. And we want to avoid products that are big\/bulky when shipping because this will increase our shipping costs.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to avoid products that require variations, such as t-shirts which require us to product multiple sizes. Variations can improve conversions of a product, but they are expensive to manufacture. So in the beginning when we have a limited budget, we want to avoid products like this.\n\nWhen you find items that meet this criteria, add it to the Jungle Scout Product Tracker. \n\nSTEP 3: Analyze the Competition\n\nNow it\u2019s time to use the Jungle Scout Chrome Extension to see whether a product has the perfect level of competition for us to make money on Amazon by selling it. Here is the criteria to look for:\n\n1) The price on average is $20 or more.\n2) The top 10 competitors should be selling 3000+ units.\n3) At least half of the top 10 competitors should be selling 300+ units a month.\n4) There should be at least 1 seller in the top 5 with less than 50 reviews.\n5) There should be at least 3 sellers in the top 10 with less than 50 reviews.\n\nIf an item meets this criteria then that is great: it would be a fantastic product to manufacture and make money on Amazon. If it doesn\u2019t meet this criteria, then we don\u2019t recommend pursuing the product.\n\nBONUS STEP: Analyze the SEO Competition\n\nThe way to sell products and make money on Amazon is to rank your product listing in the Amazon search results. And to do that, you want to pick keywords where your competitors have listings that are poorly optimized for conversions. The best way to quickly analyze which keywords are the best to target is with the Jungle Scout Niche Hunter, which is included in the Standard & Business editions of the Jungle Scout Web App.","publishedAt":"2018-02-22T00:40:40Z","tags":["how to make money on amazon","how to make money on amazon 2018","make money on amazon","amazon fba","amazon tutorial","jungle scout","jungle scout tutorial","jungle scout product research","jungle scout review","jungle scout web app","jungle scout chrome extension","private labeling","amazon private labeling","amazon product research"],"title":"How to Make Money on Amazon FBA with Private Labeling in 2018 (Jungle Scout Tutorial)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HhNtOEjSksk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HhNtOEjSksk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HhNtOEjSksk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HhNtOEjSksk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HhNtOEjSksk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT26M23S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"95","dislikeCount":"7","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"586","viewCount":"14595"}},{"id":"21P5uL7NCDU","snippet":{"description":"We answer the question: how much do you REALLY need to start dropshipping with Aliexpress?\n\u25ba\u25ba Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba Step-By-Step Dropshipping course: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/dropshipclub\n\n***OTHER LINKS\/VIDEOS REFERENCED***\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Start Dropshipping with $50: https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZY4HQKhRfpo\n\u25ba\u25ba How to Create a Shopify Store: https:\/\/youtu.be\/bXczHKgPdrw\n\u25ba\u25ba 8 Side Hustles: https:\/\/youtu.be\/GI6mW1wyol4\n\u25ba\u25ba Free Logo Maker: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/freelogo\n\u25ba\u25ba How to Pick Products with Fred Lam: https:\/\/youtu.be\/fKSalHjKhjc?t=13s\n\nWhen dropshipping, you have 3 major costs\/expenses\/things to budget for:\n\n1) Setting up your store.\n2) Marketing your store and testing products.\n3) Purchasing the products that customers buy.\n\n***How Much Does it Cost to Create a Store?***\n\nMost viewers watching this video will be looking to build their store with Shopify. That means it will cost $29\/month for the subscription, and then $14 for the domain name. That means you need just $43 up front. \n\nHowever, there are two optional costs that are good to consider:\n\n1) Purchasing a logo from Fiverr for $5.50\n\nTo build your store, you will need a logo. You can make a logo for free using a free logo maker. But a professionally designed logo will look a lot nicer in your store. For such a low cost, it is well worth it if you can afford it.\n\n2) Purchasing an Upsell Shopify Plugin for $47\/month\n\nThe SMAR7 Bundle Upsell is very beginner friendly. But it\u2019s also more expensive than a Shopify subscription! UGH! However, once you stumble upon a winning product, putting upsells on top of it will more than pay back the cost of this plugin.\n\nSo what you can do is you can leave this off your buy-list and purchase it once you\u2019ve found your winning product. You can then install this app and then put an upsell on top of your winning product. You don\u2019t need to buy it up-front.\n\n***How Much Does it Cost to Market & Test Products?***\n\nWhile you can use free traffic sources, they are slow. To take advantage of paid traffic, it is going to cost you money. In this video, we discuss Facebook ads. We recommend being prepared to test at least 20 products. \n\nWhen we say \u201ctest products\u201d with Facebook ads, we mean adding a product to your store, and then running a small ad for it on Facebook promoting it. If the ad is profitable, you scale that item up and it becomes a \u201cwinner.\u201d If it loses you money, then you kill the ad and test something new.\n\nTo run ads, I normally recommend starting with a $5\/day budget and running it for 4 days. That means that each test will cost $20\/product. So to test 20 products, it is going to cost $400. Along the way it is very likely you\u2019ll make some sales of products even if they turn out to be \u201closers\u201d - but it\u2019s good to budget for this just in-case.\n\nIf this is quite a lot of money (we understand!) here are some tips for you:\n\n1) Plan to split it up over 2-3 months. You don\u2019t need to run all of the 20 product test at once: you can do it gradually at your own pace.\n\n2) Use side hustles to save up the extra cash. It will definitely be work - but it is well worth it. There are ways to pick up jobs from home and to save up this money to reinvest into a business.\n\n***How Much Does it Cost to Buy Products Customers Purchase?***\n\nSomething that a lot of people don\u2019t talk about when discussing this question is the cost to purchase items that customers buy. If you spend all of your startup money on marketing & setup costs, then you\u2019ll have nothing left to purchase the products customers buy. And if this happens - your business is sunk! \n\nUnfortunately, money that customers pay you will not be send to you instantly. Stripe pays out every 7 days, and PayPal is likely to hold your money for 3 weeks (potentially more) until they trust you. This means you\u2019ll need to have money prepared in the meantime to pay for items until the money the customers paid you has cleared.\n\nOne of the most common reasons new businesses fail is due to cash-flow issues. If you don\u2019t want to be part of that statistic, then make sure you prepare in-advance by doing one of the following:\n\n1) Have a credit card. You will get the money the customers paid you well in-advance of when your payment will be due on it. Plus you\u2019ll get bonuses too (such as free air miles and cash back rewards to offset fees).\n\n2) Have a debit card with $200-300 on it prepared in-advance to purchase the items from Aliexpress.","publishedAt":"2018-02-14T22:02:46Z","tags":["how much money do you need to start dropshipping","how much money to start dropshipping","start dropshipping","dropshipping startup costs","how much money does it cost to create facebook ads","testing products on facebook","aliexpress","aliexpress dropshipping","SMAR7 Bundle Upsell","costs to dropship","how much money do I need to dropship"],"title":"How Much Money Do You Need to Start Dropshipping?

Please do NOT use my advice in-place of an accountants. I always recommend that any new entrepreneur gets their own accountant.\n\n* This video only covers your tax obligations when dropshipping to customers based in the USA, as that is what we teach on this channel (how to start a store and then target USA-based customers). \n\nQUESTION 1: What Taxes Do I Need to Pay When Dropshipping?\n\nWhen you are dropshipping, there are two types of taxes that you may need to pay:\n\n***Income Tax Obligations***\n\nEveryone is required to pay income tax (unless you live in an income tax haven). You only need to pay income tax on the profit that you made from your store, not the total revenue. You pay income tax to the country that you live in. \n\nSo that means that if you live in Canada, you pay income tax to the Canadian government. The same goes for Australia - if you live in Australia, you pay income tax to the Australian government. You do not live in the USA, then you do not pay income tax to it, even though you are selling to USA citizens.\n\nIf you do live in the USA then you will be required to obey both the federal and state laws regarding income tax. \n\n***Sales Tax Obligations***\n\nWhile everyone is required to pay income tax to their local country of residence, not everyone watching this video will be required to pay sales tax. In the USA, you are only required to collect and pay sales tax to a state if you have \u201cnexus\u201d in it. \n\nNexus is a legal term which means that you have a sufficient physical presence in a state that you now need to collect and pay sales tax within it. \n\nIn the USA, the federal government does not require you to collect and pay sales tax. It is handled by each individual state. So to be required to collect and pay sales tax within one, you need to have a sufficient physical presence in that state (nexus). \n\nThis means that if you live outside of the USA in another country (such as Australia, UK, India, Canada etc) then it is very unlikely that you have nexus in any USA state. That means you are not obligated\/required to collect and pay sales tax on any orders made by USA customers.\n\nIf you live in the USA, then you most likely only have nexus in a single state - the state that you live in. However, if you suspect you have a physical presence in another state, for example:\n\n* You rent\/own property in another state.\n* You have a remote employee in another state. \n\nThen I would strongly recommend going to an accountant and talk to them to find out which states you do have nexus in. \n\nQuestion 2: How Do I Collect & Pay Sales Tax when Dropshipping?\n\nOnce you know which states you have nexus in, you now need to collect sales tax on orders made by customers with shipping addresses within it. If you are using Shopify, setting your store up to collect taxes is very simple, and we have included step-by-step instructions within this video.\n\nSomething important to note is that Shopify will automatically calculate taxes for destination based states, which is very helpful.\n\nA destination based state (such as New York) requires you to collect and pay sales tax based upon where the customer you\u2019re dropshipping to lives, not where you live (in comparison to origin based states). \n\nThis can get pretty complicated since each city\/district has its own taxes! For example, in New York City, the sales tax rate is 8.875%. But in the city of Buffalo, the sales tax rate is 8.75%. You need to collect and pay the right sales tax for each order. \n\nWhat Shopify does is it will automatically calculate the correct tax based upon where the customer is - making this super simple.\n\nI also recommend using TaxJar (which automatically syncs with Shopify) as it will generate an automated report which will make paying sales tax much easier, plus they also have an auto-file option for most states which makes filing your taxes even simpler. \n\nGot any questions about paying taxes when dropshipping? Please ask them. We aren\u2019t qualified accountants, but we\u2019ll do our best to answer as many as we can.","publishedAt":"2018-02-07T23:00:04Z","tags":["what tax do I need to pay when dropshipping","dropshipping taxes","sales tax","nexus","dropshipping sales tax","dropshipping tax","how to pay sales tax when dropshipping","tax","income tax","how do I pay sales tax when dropshipping","dropshipping accountants","taxjar","shopify taxes","origin based sales tax states","destination based sales tax states"],"title":"What Tax Do I Need to Pay when Dropshipping with Aliexpress?!

Are you speaking English? Where are you from?\n\nAnswer: Yes, I am speaking english! I am from New Zealand. Because my accent can be difficult to understand (and also because we want this video to be accessible to people that can only read English, and to be respectful to the deaf community) we include captions on our videos including this one. Simply click the CC button to have captions turned on so you can read along with the video. \n\nQuestion: I can\u2019t get Chrome! Can I not use Oberlo?\n\nAnswer: There is a work-around using the Oberlo app. Watch my last year\u2019s video to see how else you can use it to add products to your store: https:\/\/youtu.be\/IakKkA_DWdQ?t=12m15s\n\nQuestion: Which version of Shopify should I purchase?\n\nAnswer: For most people, the normal $29\/month plan (Shopify Basic) is great. The additional features of the more expensive $79\/month plan (Shopify) are good once you start earning $5,000+ a month. You can upgrade to it later as your store makes money. \n\nQuestion: Does this work if you live outside of the USA?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it does! As I said, I am from New Zealand. I understand that a lot of tutorials are designed around USA citizens and that can be frustrating. Don\u2019t let the fact that you live outside the USA stop you from building a dropshipping business!\n\nInside our membership, The Dropship Club, we go deeper into some of the challenges that non-USA dropshippers face and give you practical, step-by-step solutions on how to overcome them. \n\nQuestion: Will customers really wait this long (2-4 weeks) to receive their items? \n\nAnswer: Yes, they will - if you warn them in-advance. It is good to add it to your product description and bold it. In a real dropshipping store, this is what I would do. We have a video which explains this here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sBuiN-CVxE4 \n\nQuestion: Won\u2019t customers go to Aliexpress\/Amazon.com and purchase the items I\u2019m selling and purchase from there since it is cheaper\/faster?\n\nAnswer: This is where marketing is key. When creating your product page copy, make sure that it looks the potential customer immediately. That is also why it\u2019s key to be careful about how you choose your Facebook targeting, and be careful about which Instagram influencers you choose to work with for your shoutouts. You want to make sure that you\u2019re advertising to an audience that is super-targeted for the product you are selling, so that when they see it, they get so excited that the buy it then-and-there as an impulse purchase. \n\nThis is something that we also discuss in the video, Why Long Shipping Times Don\u2019t Matter.\n\nQuestion: Do you have any recommendations for marketing stores? \n\nAnswer: Yes. My preference is with Facebook ads. Some other great methods are Instagram Influencers & SEO. That is only the beginning though. There are plenty of other ways to advertise stores (including Google ads, building Facebook fan pages etc). I recommend picking one and focusing on it as a beginner.","publishedAt":"2018-02-02T19:00:05Z","tags":["Shopify tutorial","shopify dropshipping tutorial","oberlo tutorial","shopify aliexpress tutorial","how to create a shopify store","how to create a shopify dropshipping store","how to create a dropshipping store","shopify","oberlo","aliexpress","how to dropship with shopify","dropship with shopify","shopify dropshipping"],"title":"How to Create a Shopify Aliexpress Dropshipping Store with Oberlo [UPDATED 2018 TUTORIAL]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bXczHKgPdrw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bXczHKgPdrw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bXczHKgPdrw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bXczHKgPdrw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bXczHKgPdrw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT36M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"923","dislikeCount":"110","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8135","viewCount":"259646"}},{"id":"IuEf6mopXco","snippet":{"description":"Discover the 5 Items that are TRAPS and that you should NOT SELL on Amazon.\n\u25ba\u25ba Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba The Dropship Club: https:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/thedropshipclub \n\n***SPOILER ALERT! If you want to play along with the game, then don\u2019t read on!***\n\nItem #1 to Not Sell & Private Label on Amazon: Wigzi\u2019s Dual Dog Leash (because it is patented) ***20 POINTS!***\n\nWhen you come to private label and sell an item on Amazon, it is crucial that you check to see if there are any active patents protecting the design of it. If you manufacture and sell an item that has a patent protecting it, then you risk the following:\n\n1) The holder of the patent can take your item down from Amazon, and you will lose the money you spent on your initial inventory.\n2) Amazon may potentially suspend your account for a serious infringement.\n3) The holder of the patent can sue you for patent infringement. \n\nMany Alibaba suppliers will manufacture and copy items that have active patents. Just because a supplier is producing and selling an item to you, doesn\u2019t mean that they have the right to do so. A simple and free site to use to when double checking this is Google Patents.\n\nItem #2 to Not Sell & Private Label on Amazon: Beach Towels (because it is seasonal) *** POINTS!***\n\nThere are some items that sell very well during specific times of the year. Beach towels sell well over summer. Costumes sell well over halloween. If you are doing product research during these periods of the year, it is easy to stumble onto one of these products and to see it as a great opportunity.\n\nBut that would be a big mistake, as the current sales volume is not a good indicator of how the long-term sales will be. Especially as a beginner, it is helpful to pick a product that has consistent sales over the year so you can have more reliable income. There is nothing wrong with selling seasonal products - they can make a lot of money, but they are a more advanced product to manufacture\/sell. \n\nItem #3 to Not Sell & Private Label on Amazon: Penis Enlargement Pills (because they are prohibited!) ***20 POINTS!***\n\nSomething that I did not realize until I investigated this issue, is that Amazon often do not take action to remove listings of items that are prohibited. I have never tried to sell a prohibited item, so I did not know. What I discovered from talking to Amazon is that while items may be banned, unless they are reported\/an official complaint is made, they won\u2019t bother removing them.\n\nBut, I still strongly recommend that you don\u2019t sell these products. Because while you may get away with it for a short time, at any point a customer\/seller can report your product. If they do this, then Amazon will prioritize the issue and your listing will get taken down: which was why most of the products listed were only a few months old, as the previous ones had been removed.\n\nItem #4 to Not Sell & Private Label on Amazon: iPad Cases (because they are a fad) ***5 POINTS!***\n\nWhile iPads are unlikely to go \u201cout of style\u201d and stop selling, each year new versions of iPads are released, replacing the previous ones. There is no guarantee of what size they will be, what shape they will be and how thick they will be. If you product a case\/accessory designed for one generation of the iPad family, there is no guarantee it will fit the next generation and it is a risky product. \n\nItem #5 to Not Sell & Private Label on Amazon: Essential Oils (because they have higher insurance premiums) ***10 POINTS!***\n\nOnce you sell $10,000 in a quarter, you are supposed to have product liability insurance for your product. There are some products that are trickier and more expensive to get insurance for. These are products that:\n\n1) Are designed to be applied to the human body (like essential oils).\n2) Are designed to be consumed by people or inserted into the body (like pills).\n3) Products that are accident risks (like blenders as they have blades).\n4) Products that are potential choking risks (which means you need to be extra careful with products designed to be used for kids). \n\nThere is nothing wrong with products that fit this category, but as a new seller, it\u2019s a good idea to stick to products that will cause you less headaches when it comes to this. You can focus on more advanced products like this after your first simpler product. \n\nHow many points did you win?

It is tempting because it is making a lot of sales - indicating that there is demand for it. But with very few historical reviews, you don\u2019t have enough information to know if a supplier will be good at fulfilling orders (especially if you start selling a lot). \n\nWill the quality of the items go down as the production goes up? Is the supplier good at shipping this item out on time? How many people truly like the item that they receive? A small number of reviews isn\u2019t enough to make an assessment on this. \n\nIt can be very tempting to sell items that have very few reviews - especially if it\u2019s in a hot niche that lacks products. But I strongly recommend avoiding them because you\u2019re risking getting refunds, disputes and chargebacks if the supplier can\u2019t follow-through. \n\nWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Dropship Product #2: Because it Contains Trademarks\n\nThis Star Wars mug is illegally using the Star Wars logo - a trademark they don\u2019t have permission to reuse. Dropshipping this is very bad for two reasons:\n\n1) The product will get removed from Aliexpress because it is illegal. It is only short-term money.\n2) It\u2019s illegal to sell it, and you are risking getting into trouble with the law by dropshipping it.\n\nWhy You Should Dropship Product #3: Because it\u2019s VERY Boring & Generic\n\nA lot of people ask us the same question: why would a customer purchase an item from your store at a markup, when they can go to Aliexpress or Amazon.com and buy it from there instead for cheaper? Won\u2019t the potential customer price-check your item? \n\nThe answer to this is that they won\u2019t\u2026 if you focus on getting the customer to IMPULSE BUY and on creating SCARCITY. \n\nTo get a customer to want to impulse buy, you need to make them have an emotional reaction to the item that they are seeing. They need to look at it and really, really want it. That is why the guitar mug that we featured in this video sells so well - because it\u2019s the perfect item for someone the both plays guitar and loves hot drinks. \n\nScarcity is also very important. This is when you make the customer feel that they have a limited amount of time to take an action. A good way to create scarcity when dropshipping is to run limited-time-offers, e.g. you\u2019ll sell the next 20 products at a 60% discount. This makes the customer take action and purchase it so they don\u2019t miss out on the 60% discount. And, because they think they are already getting a good deal, they don\u2019t bother to price-check the item against Aliexpress\/Amazon.com.\n\nBut with generic\/boring products, it\u2019s very difficult to make them impulse buy because the item is not very exciting and doesn\u2019t appeal directly to something they love. In addition, it\u2019s very hard to create scarcity because they can buy generic\/boring products from anywhere cheaply. So stick to selling unique, original, special items.\n\nWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Dropship Product #4: Because It Doesn\u2019t Have ePacket Shipping\n\nMake sure you ship items that have 2-3 week delivery options (like ePacket) so that customers get their items faster. This will make customer support a lot easier and you\u2019ll get less emails from unhappy customers asking where their item is. \n\nWhy You Shouldn\u2019t Dropship Product #5: It Has TERRIBLE Photos\n\nGood photos showcase what is unique and special about an item. This item (electric bottle opener) does not do this at all. The unique element to this item is that you can watch the cork go up the bottle opener. However, the pictures do not show this at all. Instead, they are just photos of the actual product itself, which looks boring. \n\nAs a new dropshipper, you will want to take advantage of free stock photos that your supplier provides, which means that you need to focus on dropshipping (and testing) products that have great photos as they are the most important part of the ad and product listing. \n\nHow many points did you score?

But this doesn\u2019t mean as a beginners that you should do that. Why? Well, because some countries are problematic to ship to. \n\nFor example - shipping to the UK takes a long time. It will take 20-40 days for an item to arrive. Compare that to ePacket shipping to the USA which is 10-20 days. We strongly recommend as a beginner focusing on countries with shorter shipping times of 2-3 weeks, as this will cause less customer support issues. \n\n#2: Create Your Own Store When Dropshipping. DON\u2019T Dropship on eBay or Amazon.\n\nA lot of beginners want to do Aliexpress dropshipping on eBay or Amazon because then they can save money and not have to set up a Shopify or Woocommerce store. However, we recommend that you don\u2019t do this as pricing competition is fierce on those websites. Spend the extra money upfront to sell in your own store.\n\n#3: Set Up an LLC (Company) \n\nA very common question we get asked at Wholesale Ted is whether you NEED to open an LLC before starting a dropshipping store. The answer is that no, you don\u2019t need to. You can sell without any legal paperwork. If you do this, you are by default a sole proprietor.\n\nHOWEVER, while you don\u2019t NEED to, it is a good idea to. By setting up an LLC you protect yourself legally in case you get sued. This is especially important for people that live in the USA.\n\nBut as it costs money to set up an LLC, not everyone will be able to afford this. If you can\u2019t afford it, don\u2019t let it stop you. It is optional.  \n\n#4: Make Shipping Times VERY Clear\n\nWe recommend that you add a shipping disclaimer (that the item will take 2-4 weeks to arrive) in the following places:\n\n1) On the product page description (bold this).\n2) On the checkout page.\n3) In the purchase confirmation email. \n\n#5: Create a Strong Refund Policy Page\n\nSet up a refund policy page and note in it that you only accept returns for faulty\/broken products. It is also industry standard to require customers ship the item back to you for a refund at their own expense. Include a link to this page in the footer of your store. \n\n#6: Set Up a Follow-Up Email Sequence\n\nDon\u2019t just use customer\u2019s emails for promoting products to them in newsletters: use this to keep the customer happy while they are waiting for the items to arrive. Send 3-4 follow-up emails over this period. In them do the following things: \n\n1) Remind them about the shipping times of 2-4 weeks that they agreed to when they purchased the item from you.\n\n2) Tell them that if they are having any issues they can always email you.\n\n3) Remind them that they can track their order online, and give them a link to how they can do this.\n\n#7: Run a Like Campaign to Your Facebook Fanpage\n\nBefore you run ads, set up a like campaign and get a few hundred likes to your store\u2019s Facebook fanpage to add authority. \n\n#8: Add 20 Products to Your Store BEFORE Testing Products\n\nDo not get impatient and only add a few products to your store before running ads. This will make your store look illegitimate and you will create mistrust between you and your potential customers as it makes your store look half-finished. Make sure you add lots of products before running ads\/tests. \n\n#9: Have Either a Credit Card Or Money Set Aside to Purchase Items Customers Buy\n\nWhen a customer buys an item from you, you will not get that money instantly. PayPal often holds money for up to 3 weeks. And Stripe pays out money weekly. So you need to make sure you have money set aside on a debit card, or have a credit card to purchase items the customer buys from you while you\u2019re waiting for your money to clear. \n\n#10: Be Prepared to Spend Money to Make Money\n\nIf you plan on running paid Facebook ads, then be prepared to test a lot of products. Don\u2019t run a few tests and then give up if they don\u2019t make you money immediately. Set aside a budget of a few hundred dollars and be willing to spend that while running lots of tests to find your winning products.","publishedAt":"2018-03-07T22:57:23Z","tags":["things to do before dropshipping","starting a dropshipping store","dropshipping","dropshipping mistakes","beginner dropshippers","beginner dropshipper","dropshipping shipping times","shipping times aliexpress","aliexpress dropshipping times","aliexpress shipping","LLC dropshipping","Do I need to set up an llc dropshipping"],"title":"10 Things to Do BEFORE Dropshipping (AVOID Beginner Mistakes)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YPKvNTly7Pg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YPKvNTly7Pg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YPKvNTly7Pg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YPKvNTly7Pg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YPKvNTly7Pg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1150","dislikeCount":"323","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"26307","viewCount":"717800"}},{"id":"-TrPG3haciU","snippet":{"description":"Learn the 3 common reasons people get sued on Amazon (and how to avoid them).\n\u25ba\u25ba Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba 7 Things to Do BEFORE Selling on Amazon: https:\/\/youtu.be\/66eeFdjzsQU \n\u25ba\u25ba How to Not Get Sued When Dropshipping: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DtEkAyKapds \n\nWhen selling on Amazon, there a 3 common reasons that people find themselves getting sued. Here is how to avoid them: \n\n#1: Your Product Hurts Someone (Or Property) & They Sue You For Damages\n\nIf your product hurts someone, then they could potentially sue you for damages. This is particularly relevant in the USA which doesn\u2019t have a public healthcare system, and the USA is the biggest online marketplace for Amazon. \n\nThis is why Amazon requires that, if for 3 months, your sales exceed $10,000 in revenue, you are required to get insurance for at least $1,000,000 in coverage. Prior to this though, Amazon does not require you to get insurance. \n\nThe easiest way to safeguard yourself against getting sued for this is to avoid products that are a potential risk. Anything that includes blades, heating elements or sharp edges is going to have a higher risk over simple items (the example used in this video of a \u201csimple item\u201d is a headphone case). \n\nThis also has the advantage that insurance for \u201csimple items\u201d is going to cost less than for riskier items. If you start out with a simple, less risky item, you\u2019ll also be able to lower the cost of insurance for future \u201criskier\u201d items by consolidating insurance (the more items you have insured, the cheaper it usually is to insure them as there is a discount). \n\n#2: Your Product Contains Trademarks or Copyrighted Images \n\nWhen manufacturing and importing products from China, you are going to have access to a lot of products containing copyrights and trademarks. In the video, the example used is that on Alibaba there are a lot of different items containing Mickey Mouse (the character is protected under both copyright and trademark law). \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that because companies are producing and selling these items, that they have the right to do so. This is not the case. They aren\u2019t producing\/manufacturing because they have the right: they are doing it because they know that they can usually get away with it.\n\nInternationally, copyrights are usually honoured. China has also agreed to honour them. However, they are rarely enforced which is why infringement is so rampant (despite being illegal). The reason it is so rarely enforced is because culturally in China, if something is easy to copy and distribute to the masses, this is considered a good thing to do. In the West, the cultural perspective is different: we view that the rights of the individual are more important. \n\nSo do not import items breaking copyrights\/trademarks. Your products will be taken down off of Amazon, and you are risking having legal action taken against you. \n\n#3: Your Products Violate Patents \n\nSomething interesting about patents is there is no such thing as an \u201cinternational patent.\u201d While countries will usually agree to honour copyrights, there is no protection for trademarks. You need to file your Patents in each individual country. This means that Chinese manufacturers regularly product items that are protected by patents in other countries like the USA.\n\nIn the video, an example of a product that is patented in the USA is one by Wigzi. It has patented dual dog leashes that contain the following features:\n\n* Has the leashes attached to a rotating wheel that is separate from the handle (to stop the dogs getting tangled). \n* Has individual triggers for each leash, so you can control the length for each one.\n* Has the leashes colour-coded to match the colours of the triggers.\n\nThere are several manufacturers on Alibaba that are producing dual leashes that have these exact same features. And as there is no active patent for this style of dog leash in China, they are allowed to sell them. But if you were to import them to the USA and sell them on Amazon.com it would be a big mistake as Wigzi would get your listing taken down, and could potentially sue you.\n\nWhen conducting product research, look to see if there are any other similar items on Amazon listed. If the item has unique features and there are no other products like it listed, there is a good chance that it is patented. You can then go to the website owned by the company listed as the seller and see if they have any patents on their site. Usually, they\u2019ll have them listed very clearly. You can then go to Google patents and check to see if the patent is still active.","publishedAt":"2018-04-25T22:18:39Z","tags":["getting sued on amazon","amazon sellers getting sued","amazon insurance","amazon selling insurance","amazon trademark infringement","amazon copyright infringement","chinese copyright infringement","importing items from china","patented products on amazon","patents","importing illegal items","illegal imports"],"title":"How to Not Get Sued on Amazon (Importing ILLEGAL Items from China) & Protect Yourself","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-TrPG3haciU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-TrPG3haciU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-TrPG3haciU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-TrPG3haciU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-TrPG3haciU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"96","dislikeCount":"7","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"571","viewCount":"17106"}},{"id":"llbzqxm6qGM","snippet":{"description":"Which is best for dropshippers: Instagram Shoutouts, or Facebook Ads for a dropshipping store?\nWEBINAR - Build a 7-Figure Dropship Store: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/7figurewebinar\nGet our free ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\nThere are two popular types of traffic sources when dropshipping: Facebook ads, and Instagram shoutouts. Which one is best for dropshipping? Let\u2019s take a look at the pros and cons of each.\n\n***VIDEOS REFERENCED***\n\n6 Facebook Ad Tips: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hkL3vu8PR2g \nSecrets to Making $2 Million with Facebook Ads: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x3m8cGu-EBk \n\nWhich Is the Easiest for Newbies to Make Money? \n\nOne of the reasons that Facebook ads can be a challenge for beginners to make money with, is because of the issue of trust. You are trying to create ads and then place them in front of users who have never seen you before, never interacted with you and don\u2019t know who you are. In addition, you are also asking them to hand over money to you, and to believe that if they give you money that they will get an item in return: all of this requires trust. \n\nWith Instagram shoutouts, you do not have the same issue of trust. Why? Because the Instagram influencer has already amassed trust by building up their audience. When they advertise your product, they are advertising it to a following that already knows who they are, have interacted with them and like them enough to follow.\n\nWINNER: Instagram shoutouts\n\nWhich is the Cheapest for Beginners to Get Started? \n\nWith Facebook ads, you should be willing to spend at least $450-500 in start-up money. That is because you need to be willing to run a lot of ads before you find a winning product. We recommend being prepared to run at least 20 ads, and as each ad costs $20, that is $400 for the ads (and then the other $50-100 in set-up costs). \n\nWith Instagram Influencers, you can negotiate with smaller influencers that have 50,000-150,000 followers for prices between $10-20. You are also more likely to make sales along the way (as it\u2019s easier to get conversions, since customers already trust the influencers).\n\nWINNER: Instagram shoutouts \n\nWhich Makes the Most Money? \n\nIn the beginning with Facebook ads, your ROI is going to be very low. That is because when you run low-cost Facebook ads, they place your ad in front of low-value users. The reason why they do this is so that you don\u2019t run out of ad spend quickly. In the beginning it can be very disheartening because you are lucky to break even or make a small profit on an ad.\n\nBut what you need to realize, is you aren\u2019t running these ads to make a profit NOW: you\u2019re running them to find products that have the potential to make large profits down the road when you place them in front of high value users after having scaled your ad spend up. With Facebook ads, because you can scale your ad budget, you can make millions of dollars. There is no way to scale like this with Instagram shoutouts. They are one-off purchases\n\nWINNER: Facebook\n\nWhich Traffic Method is the Most Scalable? \n\nWe know the answer to this is Facebook. But it\u2019s not just because of what we\u2019ve already discussed (that ad budgets with Facebook can be scaled). It\u2019s also because of the fact that on Instagram, you have a limited audience. It is not profitable to advertise to general Instagram stores because while there will be some people in the followers that are interested in your product, most people won\u2019t be. You need to stick to niche-specific pages, and there are limited numbers of these.\n\nWith Facebook, once the pixel\/algorithm has collected enough data about the types of visitors that purchase from you, it can start to bring in profitable traffic from GENERAL audiences. This is how you can reach so many people and scale massively.\n\nWINNER: Facebook ads\n\nWhich Is the Easiest for Newbies to Use? \n\nSetting up Facebook ads is quite technical. With Instagram shoutouts though, you use more \u201csoft skills.\u201d The process of finding good pages to advertise on is easy, and then it comes down to negotiating with the page. With Facebook you need to do lots of technical tasks like installing pixels, selecting targeting, clicking the right settings and even writing ad copy (usually the Instagram influencer does this for you). This is why beginners often find it easier to set up an influencer campaign.\n\nWINNER: Instagram influencers\n\nWhich Is the Most Passive?\n\nInstagram shoutouts require that you negotiate, plan out and organize ads for each week. With Facebook ads, once you\u2019ve got a winning ad - there isn\u2019t anything you need to do unless you want to. It\u2019s good to do things like test products, test ad creatives and things like that - but the same goes for Instagram. You should always be testing. And it\u2019s a LOT easier to test on Facebook than it is on Instagram.\n\nWINNER: Facebook ads.\n\nOVERALL: It is a tie! Ultimately neither is better than the other, they each have their own pros and cons.","publishedAt":"2018-04-18T22:15:35Z","tags":["instagram vs facebook","instagram influencers vs facebook ads","instagram shoutouts dropshipping","instagram influencers dropshipping","instagram influencers shopify","facebook ads dropshipping","facebook ads shopify","dropshipping traffic","aliexpress dropshipping","facebook ads","instagram shoutouts aliexpress"],"title":"INSTAGRAM vs. FACEBOOK Ads for DROPSHIPPING (which should you use with Shopify?)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/llbzqxm6qGM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/llbzqxm6qGM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/llbzqxm6qGM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/llbzqxm6qGM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/llbzqxm6qGM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"253","dislikeCount":"59","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1988","viewCount":"69766"}},{"id":"q-7_oc3sU5Y","snippet":{"description":"Learn 10 sales psychology techniques to make more sales & conversions when dropshipping.\n\u25ba\u25ba Free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba Get Our Premium Step-By-Step Dropshipping Course: https:\/\/thedropshipclub.com \n\n***OTHER LINKS REFERENCED IN THIS VIDEO***\n\nIs Dropshipping a Scam: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2sB7ZiLRzG4\nDO NOT Dropship These 5 Items: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=afaknQqkiAw \n10 Things to Do BEFORE Dropshipping: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YPKvNTly7Pg \nStart Dropshipping With $50: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZY4HQKhRfpo \n\nSales Psychology Hack #1: Use Percentage Discounts Over Number Discounts \n\nIf you are dropshipping an item priced at $30, and then discount it to $15, you would have two options. You could say that the item is $15 off, or you could say that you save 50%. It has been shown that using the percentage discount in this case converts at a much higher rate. Why? Because even though it is mathematically the same discount, 50 is a bigger number than 15, so it makes the customer feel like they are saving more money. \n\nSales Psychology Hack #2: Add a Reason for the Discount\n\nCustomers are more likely to buy an item if they see a reason that it is discounted. The reason for this is because it increases the sense of urgency for the customer. For example, if an item is on sale at 50% off as a special easter sale, then the customer has another added element of scarcity: they know that when Easter ends, that the sale will disappear - and so it reinforces that they need to act now and not miss out. \n\nSales Psychology Hack #3: Highlight Benefits, NOT Product Features\n\nWhen writing ad copy and your product descriptions, discuss how this product will benefit the customer\u2019s life instead of talking about the features of a product. Benefits show the customer how the mug will directly improve their life. If you simply list features, then the customer has to take the time to see how these features will impact them. Do the work for them. \n\nSales Psychology Hack #4: Use Jargon & Slang\n\nOne of the challenges with dropshipping with Facebook ads is building trust between the potential buyer and you. And one way that you can do that is by including niche-specific jargon and slang in your product ad and descriptions. It shows that you are knowledgeable in the niche, and it builds a connection between you and your potential customers. \n\nSales Psychology Hack #5: Paint Pictures & Overcome Obstacles with Photos\n\nPhotos\/pictures can do more than just show off the product. You can also use them to help the customer imagine themselves using the product - and use them to overcome objections they may have about the product (e.g. have a picture that shows the measurements of the product on it)\n\nSales Psychology Hack #6: Use HD Photos that Customers Can Zoom In On\n\nAmazon.com have shown that if customers can zoom in on pictures, it noticeably impacts conversions. Customers like to see finer details of items that they buy, and it also makes your store look more professional - building trust between you and them.\n\nSales Psychology Hack #7: Use Short Product Descriptions\n\nUsually, short product descriptions work best over long product descriptions when you are running paid traffic to the pages. Long page copy can be distracting for a customer that is in the mood to impulse purchase. This is why we recommend choosing either paid traffic or free SEO traffic to focus on: SEO traffic requires long product descriptions, which conflicts with this. \n\nSales Psychology Hack #8: Use Trust Words & Emblems\n\nAnother way that you can build trust with potential customers is by including words and emblems on your store from brands\/things that people already trust. E.g. you can include credit card company emblems on your site (as you accept them as a form of payment). You can include USPS as ePacket items are delivered via USPS. You can post SSL certificate images (if your site has one installed). And you can highlight certification certificates if the product you\u2019re selling has been approved by one, like the FDA.\n\nSales Psychology Hack #9: Use Emotive Words\n\nIf your product ad and description, use words that will evoke feelings in a customer. One good feeling to evoke is the feeling of getting a great deal (words that can do this include limited, hurry, slashed, massive and bonus). Another good emotion is curiosity (words that can do this include special, surprise, odd, bizarre and trick). And the final emotion to focus on, is the feeling of looking good (words that do this include gorgeous, stunning and elegant). \n\nSales Psychology Hack #10: FREE is the Most Powerful Word Of All\n\nThe tried and true technique of selling items for free + just pay shipping still works great. The word \u201cfree\u201d is extremely powerful. This technique has been used for years. It\u2019s not always suitable for your promos, but if you get a chance to try it, do it and see your conversions increase.","publishedAt":"2018-04-11T23:00:02Z","tags":["sales psychology","dropshipping","dropshipping sales","dropshipping product copy","dropshipping ad copy","facebook ad copy","aliexpress","dropshipping conversions","copywriting","sales discounts","how to make sales"],"title":"10 Sales Psychology Hacks for Dropshipping Sales & Conversions","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q-7_oc3sU5Y\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q-7_oc3sU5Y\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q-7_oc3sU5Y\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q-7_oc3sU5Y\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q-7_oc3sU5Y\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M27S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"289","dislikeCount":"34","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3708","viewCount":"90418"}},{"id":"i7_PZYhQy6M","snippet":{"description":"Did you know that dropshipping has changed\u2026 a LOT?

But dropshipping has existed WELL before both of these things. Follow Sarah on a journey back in time to discover the origins of dropshipping and how it\u2019s changed\u2026 \n\nThe 60s & 70s: Dropshipping Before the Internet \n\nDid you know that dropshipping actually began before the internet? It was kickstarted by mail order companies. In the 60s & 70s, companies were taking advantage of mail order catalogs, including large companies like JCPenny & Sears. It was very profitable for them, but it was a challenge to pick, pack and ship individual items out to customers. \n\nThe solution? They developed fulfillment warehouses that were specially designed to speed up this process (a lot of people think that Amazon FBA warehouses were the first fulfillment warehouses, but they aren\u2019t - but they did revolutionize them and massively improve them). \n\nWhen they created these, other exclusive mail order companies like CompuCard saw these fulfillment centers and knew that these represented a great opportunity: they could resell these items individually in their catalog and purchase them from these fulfillment centers. They did - and it worked. This was the first form of major-scale dropshipping. \n\nThe 90s: Dropshipping & the Dot Com Bubble \n\nWhen the internet was introduced to the mainstream public in the 90s, it took a long time for consumers to feel comfortable purchasing items online and using their credit cards. But by the late 90s, ecommerce stores were starting to grow - and a lot of online stores like Pets.com popped up. They made big promises to investments, riding the wave of euphoria that arose from more and more people trusting online stores. These online stores like Pets.com raised millions of dollars from investors. \n\nUnfortunately, these stores were not profitable: they were dropshipping from USA dropshippers that had become a lot more expensive over time due to increased shipping demands. And so by 2001, a lot of these stores went bankrupt as they were unsustainable, and the dot com bubble burst. \n\nThe 2000s: The Rise of Amazon.com & eBay.com \n\nTwo companies that survived the dot com bubble and burst were Amazon & eBay. These two sites revolutionized how individuals could sell online. No longer did you need to go through the technical, expensive process of creating an online store and advertising it. Now you could list your items on their site and let them drive the traffic for you. \n\nFor dropshipping, this was a huge boom. Previously it was very expensive to use dropshippers as not only did USA dropshippers charge a lot for their items, they had to spend an enormous amount of money during the store development and advertising phases. Facebook ads was not released until 2007, and it took several years for it to become as good as it is today. The only real option was Google Ads, which was and is very expensive. But now, Amazon & eBay advertised their website on behalf of individual sellers, which meant that dropshipping was now viable for anyone - not just large corporations. \n\n2010-2018: The Chinese Revolution with Aliexpress, Shopify & Oberlo\n\nIn 2010, dropshipping was changed forever. Previously, working with Chinese dropshippers was complicated, which was why most individual dropshippers chose to work with USA dropshippers. But in 2010, Alibaba released Aliexpress: and made purchasing individual items from Chinese manufacturers & dropshippers as simple as purchasing an item from an online store via a checkout. It removed the language & cultural barriers, and made the whole process even easier than working with USA suppliers - while being MUCH cheaper! \n\nIn addition, Shopify arose during this time, which made creating an ecommerce store much easier. And then in 2015, Oberlo came out: a Shopify app that turns Shopify stores into semi-automated Aliexpress dropshipping stores. This was so successful, that in 2017 Shopify actually purchased Oberlo, and integrated the app even further. \n\nAnd thus we arrive at today. Now we can dropship in our own stores & control our own destiny, because\u2026\n\n1) We have access to cheap dropshippers & items with Aliexpress.\n2) It\u2019s simple, easy & affordable to create professional semi-automated dropshipping stores with Shopify & Oberlo.\n3) Traffic is simple & cheap thanks to Facebook ads.","publishedAt":"2018-05-23T23:00:06Z","tags":["aliexpress dropshipping","dropshipping","dropshipping changes","oberlo","shopify","shopify dropshipping","alibaba aliexpress","dropshipping on amazon","dropshipping on ebay","dot com bubble","chinese dropshippers","usa dropshippers","history of dropshipping"],"title":"The TRUTH About the History of Dropshipping","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i7_PZYhQy6M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i7_PZYhQy6M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i7_PZYhQy6M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i7_PZYhQy6M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i7_PZYhQy6M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"193","dislikeCount":"23","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1286","viewCount":"23749"}},{"id":"Tep3yL_tzYQ","snippet":{"description":"Sarah reviews a viewer\u2019s dropshipping store! Get our ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba 10 Sales Psychology Hacks: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q-7_oc3sU5Y \n\u25ba\u25ba Our premium step-by-step video training course: https:\/\/thedropshipclub.com \n\nWhen reviewing this subscriber\u2019s Shopify dropshipping store, Sarah focused on 3 main elements of it:\n\n1) The store design & branding.\n2) The products listed in the store.\n3) The product listings & descriptions. \n\nLet\u2019s see what this Shopify dropshipping store did right - and how it could improve!\n\n#1: The Store Design & Branding (tips for improving Shopify store design & branding) \n\nThis store did not have a custom logo. We highly recommend that you invest in a custom logo for your store. You can buy one from Fiverr for $5 (plus a 50 cent transaction fee). The store homepage also looked very empty as there was very little content on it. An easy way to add additional content to make it look bigger would be to preview products that you are selling on the store there. \n\nIn addition, this watch store had watches for men, women and children - yet the colour scheme was very male-centric. It had the same colour scheme that you would expect to see in a male accessory store. This immediately would put off females that had come to the site. \n\nSomething else that the site needed to work on was the fact that it was emphasizing heavily that profits were being donated to charity. On the homepage there was no mention of what charity it was, and when a customer navigated to the page that was supposed to explain the mission, there was no explanation about why the profits were being donated. Unless the customer identifies with your mission and believes in it, they\u2019d rather just buy a watch cheaper elsewhere.\n\n#2: The Products Listed in the Store (tips for picking winning products for your Shopify dropshipping store). \n\nThe male watches listed were very generic. They were nice watches - but there was nothing about them that appealed to people\u2019s hobbies\/passions. Picking products that do this are key to triggering impulse purchases. \n\nTo help explain this, Sarah used an example in the video: a nice looking mug with a flower on it, versus a mug that makes your face look like a cat face when you drink out of it. No one would purchase the flower mug because while it is a nice mug, they can buy a mug like that elsewhere. The mug that turns your face into a cat is a lot more exciting because it triggers emotional feelings in people that love cats\/cute things. \n\nThe watches in the female section had a lot more potential as there were several watches that appealed to niches\/hobbies\/passions. Some examples included a peacock watch, a watch with a world map on it and a sailing watch that featured an anchor. \n\n#3: The Product Listings & Descriptions (tips for improving your Shopify dropshipping product description copy). \n\nThe product listing and description is where a lot of dropshippers cut corners. They are more likely to put time into designing a nice homepage than creating a good product description. This is a major mistake because no matter what, for a customer to purchase the item, they have to go to your product listing and see the description. It is a key element of your sales funnel.\n\nHere are some tips Sarah gave the subscriber to improve their product listing:\n\n* For the title, Sarah recommended that this subscriber change the name of the product to something that was relevant to the niche, and to try and use an emotive word in the title. \n\n* She thought the price was a good price - it was under $15 which means it is priced low enough to be an impulse purchase. \n\n* She liked that the thumbnail picture was the product on a white background, but recommended adding in photos showing the product being used in real life.\n\n* She recommended uploading photos large enough so that the customer could zoom in on them as this has been proven to increase conversions. \n\n* She was happy to see that there was a very clear shipping disclaimer. Doing this will greatly decrease refunds, disputes and chargebacks. \n\n* She recommended that the subscriber update their product description. It is currently bullet points that point out product features. She recommended adding in 2-3 paragraphs that sell the customer on the benefits of the product and how it will improve their lives and to use emotive words. She also recommended adding in trust words.\n\n* She recommended turning reviews off unless you have at least 1 review for the product to upload.\n\n* She recommended having a related products section at the bottom of the page to encourage cross-sells. \n\nTake a look at your store, and see if you are making any of these mistakes for yourself and fix them in your Shopify dropshipping store!","publishedAt":"2018-05-09T23:00:01Z","tags":["store review","dropshipping store review","dropship store review","shopify store review","shopify store","dropshipping","aliexpress dropshipping","dropshipping watches","dropship watches","aliexpress watches","picking products","winning products","dropshipping winning products"],"title":"Reviewing a Subscriber's Shopify Store!

Don\u2019t do this. Focus on adding items to your store that are unique and will appeal to a particular niche\/hobby\/passion. Not only does this encourage people to buy because they\u2019ll have a strong reaction to seeing it, but it increases the perceived value of the item. \n\nQuestion 2: Do You Have Good Product Ad Images? \n\nImages are the most important part of the Facebook ad. Do you have sharp, clear images that clearly show what is unique\/special about the product that you are selling? If you don\u2019t, source some photos - and for some products, a video may be necessary. \n\nQuestion 3: Do You Have Good Product Listing Images? \n\nImages are also the most important part of the product listing. Try and find images that are in high-quality (big enough for the customer to be able to zoom in on them) and that show the product in a real-life context (e.g. have a mug sitting on a table), not just photos of it on a white background. You can also use pictures to overcome potential objections. \n\nQuestion 4: Do You Have a Custom Color Scheme? \n\nThis helps build a brand. It doesn\u2019t need to be complex: picking 2 colours to build your store around is enough. \n\nQuestion 5: Does Your Store Have a Custom Logo?\n\nA custom logo is essential for building a brand into your store (which creates trust). You can buy a simple logo from Fiverr for just $5 (plus a 50 cent transaction fee). \n\nQuestion 6: Does Your Product Appeal to a Certain Niche? \n\nMake sure that for each item you are advertising on Facebook, that they each appeal to a certain hobby\/passion\/niche. This will encourage people to impulse buy out of emotion at wanting the item.\n\nQuestion 7: Did You Add Scarcity to Your Product Ads? \n\nMake sure that you add some form of limited discount to the products that you advertise with Facebook ads. It could be 50% off for a limited time, or offering the product as \u201cfree\u201d (just-pay-shipping) to a limited number of people. \n\nQuestion 8: Did You Add Scarcity to EVERY Product You Are Selling\n\nDon\u2019t add scarcity to each product as it will make the special offer you\u2019re advertising less exciting. Very important - do not add scarcity timers to every product page. \n\nQuestion 9: Did You Add 20 Products to Your Store? \n\nAdding in at least 20 products is important for making your store look professional and to build trust. A lot of people get lazy and add only a few - so don\u2019t make this mistake. \n\nQuestion 10: Have You Added Product Descriptions? \n\nCreate a custom video description for each product. A nice product description length to aim for is 2 short paragraphs that are just 2-3 sentences long each. \n\nQuestion 11: Have You Tested 20 Products? \n\nMost people give up on dropshipping after testing 5 or less products. Be patient and be willing to test at least 20 products to find a winning item.\n\nQuestion 12: Did You Run a Like Campaign to Your Facebook Fanpage\n\nRun a small $6-10 like campaign to your fanpage to give it some likes. This will help build trust with potential customers through social proof.\n\nQuestion 13: Do You Have Trust Words & Emblems in Your Store? \n\nSome easy trust words\/emblems to add are credit card companies & shipping companies. \n\nQuestion 14: Are Your Products Priced at $15 or Less?\n\nThis is the sweet-spot pricing for impulse purchases. Sell low-cost items that you can price for no more than $15. \n\nQuestion 15: Have You Done a Test Purchase?\n\nAnd of course, if you aren\u2019t getting any sales - do a test purchase in your store. You might find that the reason nobody is buying anything inside your Shopify store is because no one can!","publishedAt":"2018-05-02T22:15:36Z","tags":["not making sales","no sales","no sales dropshipping","no sales facebook ads","facebook ads not working","making no money dropshipping","product descriptions","facebook ads","dropshipping facebook ads","dropshipping scarcity","scarcity","scarcity sales","dropshipping testing products","aliexpress","aliexpress dropshipping","shopify","shopify store no sales"],"title":"Why You AREN\u2019T MAKING SALES in Your Dropshipping Store or Facebook Ads (& How to Fix It)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NqhaDTsCEe8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NqhaDTsCEe8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NqhaDTsCEe8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NqhaDTsCEe8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NqhaDTsCEe8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"511","dislikeCount":"106","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6375","viewCount":"194286"}},{"id":"huQTB7Msvr0","snippet":{"description":"In this video, we compare Shopify vs Woocommerce (and look at Oberlo vs. AliDropship!).\n\u25ba\u25ba Free Ebook - 6 Steps of a 6 Figure Dropshipping Store: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba Shopify Dropshipping Step-By-Step Tutorial: https:\/\/youtu.be\/bXczHKgPdrw \n\n***OTHER LINKS REFERENCED IN THE VIDEO***\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Woocommerce Dropshipping Step-By-Step Tutorial: https:\/\/youtu.be\/3yamuri8czM \n\u25ba\u25ba Get Shopify: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/shopify (aff link)\n\u25ba\u25ba Get AliDropship: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/alidropship (aff link) \n\u25ba\u25ba Get SiteGround http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/siteground (aff link) \n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to answer the following questions:\n\n1) Which requires the least start-up money: Shopify or Woocommerce?\n2) Which will cost the most money in the long-term: Shopify or Woocommerce? \n3) Which is cheaper, Shopify or Woocommerce, for opening multiple stores?\n4) Which is the easiest for beginners to use, Woocommerce or Shopify?\n5) And which has the best dropshipping plugin, Oberlo or AliDropship? \n\n#1: Which Requires the Least Start-Up Money? \n\nWith Shopify, to get started, you need $29 for the monthly Basic subscription, which is perfect for most people. You can also purchase a domain name with Shopify which costs $14. In total, that means that you will need $43 to open a store with Shopify. \n\nNow let\u2019s compare this to Woocommerce. On the surface it seems like it would be free, because Woocommerce is a free plugin for Wordpress. However, you still need to purchase hosting and a domain name. For hosting, we recommend SiteGround as it is low-cost yet still has an SSL certificate (a requirement for all ecommerce stores). You need to purchase a 1-year subscription which will cost $47.40. And you can purchase a domain name through SiteGround for $15.95. That means to get started you need $63.35. So, clearly, Shopify is the winner here.\n\nNOTE: You can purchase a cheaper domain through a site like Namecheap, but for beginners we recommend buying it through your hosting provider as it\u2019ll make the setup process easier.\n\n#2: Which is the Cheapest in the Long-Term? \n\nWhile Shopify is cheaper to get started with, Woocommerce is easiest the cheaper in the long-term. With Woocommerce, your hosting is likely to be a 1-year plan. SiteGround\u2019s basic plan is $47.40 for an entire year.\n\nOn the other hand, Shopify\u2019s $29 plan is a monthly charge. That means for 1-year with Shopify, you will pay $348. You can choose to pay upfront for 1-year for a 10% discount, which will bring the price down to $313.20 - but that is still substantially more than a Woocommerce store!\n\n#3: Which is the Cheapest for Multiple Stores? \n\nWith Shopify, each store plan covers just 1 store. So to open up a new store, you will need to purchase an additional plan. \n\nWith Woocommerce & SiteGround, while the smallest $3.95\/month plan will only host a single website, you can instead choose their GrowBig plan which will let you host multiple websites on a single account. The GrowBig plan will cost $5.95 billed annually, which means that for 1-year you\u2019ll pay just $71.40 to host as many websites as you like. Starting multiple stores with Woocommerce is definitely cheaper.\n\n#4: Which is the Easiest for Beginners to Use? \n\nShopify revolutionized the world of ecommerce by creating an extremely streamlined, easy-to-use platform to build a store with. A big part of why it\u2019s so easy to use is that Shopify was designed with the single purpose of making ecommerce stores easy to create - Shopify does nothing else, so the UI is designed around that sole purpose. It also means that it is largely glitch-free. \n\nOn the other hand, Woocommerce is far more clunky. The reason for this is that it\u2019s a plugin for Wordpress, a software platform that was designed to make blogs: not ecommerce stores. When you install Woocommerce on a Wordpress site, you are adding ecommerce functionality that was not intended to be there. What this means is that not only do you have additional blog-functionality bloating the UI (which could also be potentially confusing for beginners) but Woocommerce is more likely to be glitchy and not integrate well with Wordpress\/other plugins\/themes because its an add-on. \n\n#5: Which Has the Best Aliexpress Dropshipping App: Oberlo or AliDropship? \n\nWhile we think that AliDropship is a remarkable plugin for Wordpress\/Woocommerce stores, our preference is definitely Oberlo for Shopify. The reason for this is that Shopify actually acquired Oberlo in 2017 which means that it\u2019s now an official, support app for Shopify. As a result, Oberlo is virtually glitch-free and integrated extremely smoothly.\n\nOn the other hand, AliDropship is a plugin for a plugin for Wordpress. What that means is that Wordpress is not designed with AliDropship in mind, and so you are adding additional functionality to it. This means that you are far more likely to encounter glitches\/AliDropship not working or integrating with other plugins\/themes.","publishedAt":"2018-06-26T23:06:33Z","tags":["shopify vs woocommerce","woocommerce vs shopify","shopify","woocommerce","oberlo vs alidropship","alidropship vs oberlo","best ecommerce platform","best ecommerce platform 2018","shopify vs. woocommerce 2018","alidropship","ecommerce platform"],"title":"Shopify vs. Woocommerce - Best Ecommerce Platform in 2018?

Which makes the most money? Find out!\n\u25ba\u25ba Free Webinar! $1,000\/Day with Affiliate Marketing: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/passivewebinar\n\u25ba\u25ba Free Ebook - 6 Steps of a 6 Figure Dropshipping Store: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\n***OTHER LINKS DISCUSSED IN THIS VIDEO***\n\nHow We Make $500\/Day With Affiliate Marketing: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-EJkasSgiTs \nHow to Make $1 Million Dollars in a Year: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7AhrpqKgS2o\n\nWhat is Affiliate Marketing? How Do You Make Money with Affiliate Marketing?\n\nIn this business model, your goal is to refer customers\/clients to another business. If they purchase their products\/services, you make a commission on the sale. The way that these businesses track your sales is with something called a hoplink. When a customer clicks on this hoplink and then purchases an item, you get credited with the sale. \n\nWhat is Dropshipping (with Aliexpress)? How Do You Make Money with Dropshipping? \n\nDropshipping (with Aliexpress) is when you go to Aliexpress and find low-cost items to list in your own online store (e.g. you can make a store with Shopify) with a mark-up price. You then run Facebook ads to the products in your store promoting them. When a customer buys an item in your store, you then go to Aliexpress and order the item for them. You keep the difference in profit. \n\nQuestion 1: Which Is Easiest for Beginners - Affiliate Marketing or Dropshipping? \n\nThere is no clear winner when it comes to this question: both business models have their own advantages and disadvantages. \n\nWith affiliate marketing, it has the advantage that your affiliate merchant partner is likely established and has built up trust online. That means that if you refer a potential customer to them, that the conversion rates will be higher because they are more likely to feel comfortable purchasing from them - unlike with dropshipping where as a fresh store, you don\u2019t have built up credibility. \n\nOn the other hand, with dropshipping, your store is usually in a less saturated market for Facebook ads. For big, profitable affiliate products, a lot of affiliates will be trying to run Facebook ads directly to the offers, making traffic expensive and competitive. In addition, you have larger profit margins to work with when dropshipping, which also helps make it easier to create profitable Facebook ads. This is very relevant as Facebook ads are probably the easiest source of traffic for beginners. \n\nQuestion 2: What Makes the Most Money? Affiliate Marketing or Dropshipping?\n\nDropshipping has the highest potential to make money. The reason for this is that when you create a store and sell products in it, you are building up a list of buyers that you know are interested in the products that you sell. So if you have a store selling products related to Astrology, then you know that people who purchase items in your store are interested in products related to Astrology - and you can send out emails to them in the future promoting similar products, and make more sales\/money.\n\nWith affiliate marketing, you are helping your merchant build a list - NOT you. And they will take the buyers that you send them, and they will send them a lot of emails promoting more of their products. With affiliate marketing, you are making one-off sales. \n\nQuestion 3: Which is the Most Passive? Affiliate Marketing or Dropshipping? \n\nAffiliate Marketing is a more passive business model than dropshipping. The reason for that is while you can semi-automate a dropshipping store, you still need to manage and fulfill orders. When a customer comes to your store and purchases an item, you need to go to Aliexpress, order the item and then get it shipped out to your customer. This is called order fulfillment. You also need to do customer support and reply to emails and messages left by customers. You can in-time make your business a lot more passive by hiring staff to run it for you, though you will need to manage those staff members.\n\nBut with affiliate marketing, you don\u2019t do any of this - the merchant partner does this for you. THEY send the products out to the customers, THEY fulfill the orders and THEY answer customer emails. As long as you have a traffic source setup that is sending referrals to the merchant, the business will run on autopilot. \n\nSo which is better? The answer is neither: they both have their own pros and cons. Choose the business model that is right for you.","publishedAt":"2018-06-18T23:00:01Z","tags":["affiliate marketing vs dropshipping","dropshipping vs affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing","dropshipping","affiliate","dropshipping with aliexpress","online business model","how to make money with affiliate marketing","how to make money with dropshipping","make money with affiliate marketing","make money with dropshipping"],"title":"Affiliate Marketing vs Dropshipping (with Aliexpress) - Which Online Business Method Is Best?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/M799NBsohA8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/M799NBsohA8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/M799NBsohA8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/M799NBsohA8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/M799NBsohA8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M39S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"197","dislikeCount":"50","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1429","viewCount":"54650"}},{"id":"-EJkasSgiTs","snippet":{"description":"Discover how our YouTube channel makes $500 a Day with affiliate marketing (passive income!)\n\u25ba\u25ba Free Webinar - $1,000\/Day Passively with Aff Marketing: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/passivewebinar\n\u25ba\u25ba Free Ebook - 6 Steps of a 6 Figure Dropshipping Store: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\nWe love monetizing our channel with affiliate links because it means we get to keep our YouTube videos free, while being able to be compensated for our time. \n\nWe also love affiliate marketing because it\u2019s a very passive business model.

Here is the truth about selling on Amazon.\n\n#1: Income Screenshots are REVENUE, NOT Profit\n\nWhen you see an income screenshot posted by someone, remember that this is the total amount in SALES that they have made. This is not the profit that they have earned. If someone posts that they have made $10,000 in sales last month, this does not take into account the expenses paid to make those sales (like purchasing inventory, the costs of shipping, Amazon FBA fees or costs spent on marketing). \n\nUsually, if someone is making consistent, monthly sales, this is a good indicator that they are making a profit. How much profit you can\u2019t know - but in the industry, the yardstick that most people aim for is to make a 30% profit margin on Amazon FBA private label items. \n\nHowever, while most people do usually profit from their sales, there is one big exception to this: and that is the first month in business. \n\nWhen you launch a product on Amazon, to be able to make a large volume of sales, you need to run a launch campaign and use marketing techniques to generate as many sales as possible. To do this, sellers do the following things:\n\n* Send out discount coupons using services like ZonJump.\n* Invest money into Amazon PPC ads.\n* Discount the price of the item (price competition). \n\nAll of these marketing techniques can be very expensive, and they eat into profits. That 30% profit margin is based off customers finding your item organically using the search engine - NOT from people buying it from a discount coupon\/from a PPC ad. This means it is very common for new Amazon products to at best break even or, more likely, LOSE money in their first month.\n\nHowever: it\u2019s worth it. By investing into a launch campaign, you can create a huge volume of sales and push your item to the top of the Amazon search results and make passive, on-going sales into the future. \n\n#2: To Make a Lot of Money, You NEED A LOT OF MONEY! \n\nUnlike dropshipping where you can get started for $500, with Amazon FBA private labeling you\u2019re going to need a lot of money. As Sarah explains in the video, to launch a product that makes $10,000\/month in sales, you will need at least $9,000 just for the inventory alone, and that doesn\u2019t include the costs of marketing, tools etc. \n\nHowever, you don\u2019t need $9,000 to launch a product on Amazon. You can get started with smaller budgets like $3,000, but if you do, you will need to be realistic about the types of products that you choose to sell. Look to sell a product that is on average doing a low monthly sales volume (a good number to look for is around 100 units a month). \n\nAnother advantage of these products as well is that they usually have less competition, as most Amazon FBA private labelers want to go after higher volume items. This means you\u2019ll need to spend less money on marketing when launching your product. \n\n#3: It\u2019s Very Easy to Go Into Debt When Running an Amazon FBA Business\n\nWhen you are running an Amazon FBA business, it is very easy to go into a lot of debt. Why? Well, it\u2019s because your expenses are very high. It\u2019s very expensive to purchase inventory. Most of the money that flows into the business is going to go towards paying for expenses. This means that you need to be careful that you manage that cash in it. \n\nA common trap that Amazon private labelers fall for, especially high-level Amazon businesses, is that they try and expand too quickly. They realize that if they spend money purchasing MORE items and MORE inventory, that they can sell it and make MORE money. And so they use all of the cash they have, and max out their debt, in an attempt to purchase as many items as possible.\n\nAnd this is all well and good\u2026 until they get an unexpected bill, like a tax bill. Normally they could pay it, but because they\u2019ve tied up all of their cash and debt in inventory, they don\u2019t have any money left to pay the bill. And even though they will have the money to pay for it tomorrow, it doesn\u2019t matter, because it needs to be paid for TODAY. \n\nBut this can be easily avoided if you manage your cash flow correctly. We strongly recommend you follow the Profit First system!","publishedAt":"2018-06-06T22:00:00Z","tags":null,"title":"3 Things Amazon Gurus DON'T Tell You About Selling on Amazon FBA...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-PFtVce4cg4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-PFtVce4cg4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-PFtVce4cg4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-PFtVce4cg4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-PFtVce4cg4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"245","dislikeCount":"51","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2142","viewCount":"52252"}},{"id":"3yamuri8czM","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial, learn how to create an AliDropship Woocommerce dropshipping store step-by-step! \n\u25ba\u25ba Get Siteground: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/siteground (aff link)\n\u25ba\u25ba Get AliDropship: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/alidropship (aff link)\n\u25ba\u25ba Get our free $10,000\/Month ebook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\n***ALL LINKS MENTIONED IN THE VIDEO***\n\nGet Siteground here: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/siteground\nGet AliDropship here: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/alidropship\nGo to Chrome Extension Store here: https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/category\/extensions\nGo to AliDropship Themes Page here: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/alidropshipthemes\nGo to free logo maker here: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/freelogo\nGet free ebook here: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step \n(Video) How to Dropship Blindly: https:\/\/youtu.be\/-edMSxkCxJI \n(Video) Why Long Shipping Times Don\u2019t Matter: https:\/\/youtu.be\/sBuiN-CVxE4 \n(Video) 10 Things to Do BEFORE Dropshipping: https:\/\/youtu.be\/YPKvNTly7Pg\n(Video) How to Not Get Sued When Dropshipping: https:\/\/youtu.be\/DtEkAyKapds  \n\n***TIMESTAMPS FOR EACH STEP***\n\nStep 1: Setup Hosting & Domain with Siteground (2:40) \nStep 2: Install Wordpress (7:07) \nStep 3: Install Woocommerce (8:31) \nStep 4: Install & Activate AliDropship Plugin (Woocommerce Aliexpress importer) (10:09)\nStep 5: Install the AliDropship Chrome Extension (13:27)\nStep 6: Install the AliDropship Theme - Shopper (14:38)\nStep 7: Edit the AliDropship Settings (16:20)\nStep 8: Add a Custom Logo & Colour Scheme (18:33)\nStep 9: Add Products to Your Store (20:45)\nStep 10: Add Product Categories (21:58)\nStep 11: Create an About Us Page (22:47)\nStep 12: Create a Contact Us Page (23:55)\nStep 13: Add a Free Shipping option (24:48)\nStep 14: Set up PayPal for the Checkout (26:42)\nStep 15: How to Customize the Homepage (28:06)\nStep 16: Update the Product Pages (31:47)\nStep 17: Add a Store Menu (39:39)","publishedAt":"2018-06-01T00:00:01Z","tags":["alidropship","alidropship tutorial","how to create an alidropship store","woocommerce","how to create a woocommerce store","how to create a woocommerce dropshipping store","woocommerce dropshipping","woocommerce tutorial","how to create a woocommerce dropshipping store tutorial","woocommerce aliexpress dropshipping","woocommerce aliexpress plugin","siteground tutorial"],"title":"TUTORIAL: AliDropship Woocommerce Store (Create a Woocommerce Dropshipping Store) UPDATED 2018","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3yamuri8czM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3yamuri8czM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3yamuri8czM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3yamuri8czM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3yamuri8czM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT43M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"511","dislikeCount":"53","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2497","viewCount":"125615"}},{"id":"-70yvdzfiZ4","snippet":{"description":"See Michael's actual winning products from a print on demand store that made $1 million\/year+!\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE WEBINAR: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/go\/printprofits\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE EBOOK: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\nQUESTION: What is Print On Demand? \n\nANSWER: It is kind of a form of dropshipping. Print On Demand is when you take a piece of artwork, and you use an app like Printful (which works with a Shopify store) to place that artwork on items that customers purchase (t-shirts, hoodies, mugs etc) and to print them. Printful will then ship these items out directly to the customer. \n\nQUESTION: What sorts of artwork and designs work best for Print On Demand?\n\nANSWER: The best designs are those that target a very passionate niche. Michael Shih from Print Profits targeted the gothic fashion niche. Using the Facebook insight tool he was about to see that over 2 million users were interested in it. It also helps if you can move into a secondary niche: in this case, the sugar skull niche was related and customers passionate about one niche tended to be passionate about that niche too.\n\nQUESTION: How can you scale Facebook ads to huge profits with Print On Demand?\n\nANSWER: When scaling Facebook ads, you can scale horizontally (split testing different ads, using different creatives like images) or you can scale vertically (increasing the budget). Michael Shih from Print Profits made over a million dollars in a year from his Print On Demand store by doing both. He was able to massively increase the amount of money per order by adding in a product upsell funnel. He took the money he made, and invested it into his Facebook ad scaling spend.\n\nQUESTION: Where can you find artwork to use for Print On Demand products?\n\nANSWER: You can use image sites like Shutterstock and iStockPhotos. You can also hire an artist to make an original design for you. Make sure that you have the rights to resell and to use it for commercial products. An artist will usually charge you more if you plan to use their artwork like that. If you don\u2019t do this, your Print On Demand store could be sued for copyright infringement. \n\nQUESTION: What are some unique items you can print onto that convert well?\n\nANSWER: Most people think to sell t-shirts, hoodies and mugs. But did you know that you can print onto shot glasses, wine glasses and jewelry? Michael Shih from Print Profits has found that these convert very well. \n\nQUESTION: What are some unique ways to run tests to find winning products?\n\nANSWER: Michael has some interesting strategies that he uses:\n\n* He creates Facebook ads targeting engagement. He then adds images of 4 products and asks the viewer \u201cwhich do you like the most?\u201d \n\n* Once he\u2019s built up a customer email base, he will email them and do a poll on what types of items they would like.\n\n* He runs an ad that is promoting a giveaway, but instead of sending them directly to the product page for the free-just-pay-shipping offer, he sends them to a Shopify collection page. He then see\u2019s which products people add in addition to their cart the most, and runs ad campaigns for those products. \n\nQUESTION: What mistakes do new dropshippers make with their Print On Demand Stores?\n\nANSWER: Here were some of the biggest mistakes newbies make that Michael identified: \n\n1) They find a winning product and they stop testing new products. They find a winning t-shirt design but they don\u2019t test the design onto different types of products, like leggings, and lose a lot of money they could be making. \n\n2) They try and scale their Facebook ads too quickly. If you try and scale your ads too fast, Facebook does not collect enough data during the learning phase and the ad \u201cdies off.\u201d \n\n3) Not having a funnel in-place. Michael Shih from Print Profits was able to make over a million dollars in a year because he has a funnel which upsells customers to more items. Once you find a winning item, put in an upsell funnel ASAP.","publishedAt":"2018-07-13T23:00:02Z","tags":["print on demand","how to make $1 million in a year","how to make a million dollars in a year","print on demand shopify","print on demand winning items","winning items","winning items dropshipping","print profits","Michael Shih","Print on demand niches","facebook scaling","print on demand facebook ads","facebook ads dropshipping","print on demand designs"],"title":"[Case Study] $1 Million in a YEAR from Print on Demand w\/ Michael Shih","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-70yvdzfiZ4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-70yvdzfiZ4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-70yvdzfiZ4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-70yvdzfiZ4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"521","dislikeCount":"133","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5817","viewCount":"205915"}},{"id":"AKB8OK_xP18","snippet":{"description":"Do these 5 things BEFORE using a Chinese Aliexpress Dropshipper or Alibaba Supplier!\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE EBOOK - Download Now: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba Join Our Step-By-Step Dropshipping Course: https:\/\/thedropshipclub.com\n\u25ba\u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wFSqwNZDixQ\n\n#1: Check to see if your suppliers has been to a tradeshow\n\nIf you are trying to decide between two suppliers, checking to see if either has been to a tradeshow is a great way to help pick between them. Going to a tradeshow is very expensive and so a lot of legitimate suppliers do not go because it is hard to make enough money back to make it profitable. What this means is that if a supplier has gone, then it indicates they are financially is a good position (which means they are unlikely to go out of business any time soon). \n\nIf your supplier is on Alibaba, you can go to their profile and check to see if they have visited any tradeshows. If your supplier is based on Aliexpress, find the brand of the item that you would like to sell and then go to Alibaba to locate the manufacturer. You can then visit the manufacturers profile page to see if they have been to a tradeshow. \n\n#2: Avoid using pictures with models\n\nIf you are working with a Chinese dropshipper on Aliexpress or a Chinese supplier on Alibaba and they have stock photos that use models, we recommend that you don\u2019t use those photos yourself. This is because Chinese suppliers have a history of illegally taking pictures from model\u2019s social media accounts (like stealing the images from Instagram). They can get away with this in China, but in the West the model can contact Facebook\/Amazon and get your ad\/listing taken down. Avoid using pictures with models so that you don\u2019t infringe on copyright.\n\n#3: Check to see if you\u2019re working with a manufacturer, trade company or wholesaler\n\nOn Alibaba you will usually encounter two types of suppliers: manufacturers and trade companies. A manufacturer is the factory that originally made the item. A trade company is a middle-man between a manufacturer\/factory and you. Neither is better than the other, they both have advantages and disadvantages. The advantage with a manufacturer is that you\u2019re going straight to the source and it\u2019s usually cheaper. On the other hand, a trade company usually charges more since they make a commission on the sale, but their reps usually speak better english which makes communication much better (sometimes they can negotiate lower prices than if you were buying straight from the manufacturer as well so it\u2019s good to check even if you are price sensitive). You can check what the company is in their Alibaba profile. \n\nOn Aliexpress you\u2019ll usually encounter either manufacturers or wholesalers. Manufacturers tend to brand their store their generic label brand (e.g. Transhome) and only sell products under their brands. Wholesalers will usually name their store something less generic (e.g. Mr & Mrs Store) and will sell products from a variety of manufacturers. Wholesalers are sometimes more expensive but they have a wider selection of products.\n\n#4: Recap your agreements and contracts in writing\n\nIf you and your supplier are negotiating a contract or an agreement, make sure that you get your suppliers to recap it and write out the agreement in text. It\u2019s very easy for both cultural and language differences to cause misunderstandings. Ask your suppler to recap each element of your agreement in text (either by email or by sending a copy of your contract in writing). \n\n#5 Prioritize products that have multiple manufacturers\n\nThe profit margins for Chinese manufacturers is very small, because they sell their items so cheaply. That, along with the fact that doing business in China is relatively difficult means that unless a factory is well managed, it can go bankrupt and have to close. If you\u2019re dropshipping an item or private labeling it for Amazon and your supplier goes out of business, then unless you have a backup supplier that manufactures the same item - you will have nothing to sell and your money will dry up. \n\nThat is why, when choosing between products, it\u2019s good to look for one that has multiple manufacturers and suppliers. Then, on the off-chance your supplier has to close it\u2019s doors, you can switch to a new one - and your business can continue, and you can keep making money.","publishedAt":"2018-07-09T23:00:01Z","tags":["working with chinese suppliers","chinese suppliers","alibaba","aliexpress","aliexpress suppliers","alibaba suppliers","dropshipping","dropshippers","chinese dropshippers","chinese aliexpress dropshippers","chinese alibaba suppliers"],"title":"5 Things to Do BEFORE Working With Chinese Dropshippers & Suppliers (Aliexpress & Alibaba Tips)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKB8OK_xP18\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKB8OK_xP18\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKB8OK_xP18\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKB8OK_xP18\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKB8OK_xP18\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M53S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"491","dislikeCount":"202","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11047","viewCount":"339128"}},{"id":"J8kRw2plynY","snippet":{"description":"STOP worrying about these 7 dropshipping myths!

When customers use the tracking code we give them, they\u2019ll quickly see that the package is coming from China.\n\nIt is true though that if you were to advertise that it was going to be sent from China, that people would be less willing to purchase. So do not advertise that it\u2019s going to be sent from China, but don\u2019t try to hide it from the customer either. If a customer gets upset about it coming from China, say that you\u2019re shipping the item out directly to them to expedite the shipping process so that they get their item faster, as there has been huge demand for it. \n\nMyth #2: What About South Dakota vs. Wayfair Ruling for Dropshippers?\n\nIn June 2018 there was an important Supreme Court case for dropshippers (and online retailers): Wayfair vs. South Dakota. In it, South Dakota won their case that they could require online retailers who don\u2019t have nexus (in other words, a physical presence in South Dakota) to have to collect and pay sales tax. This was a huge ruling as previously in the USA, you had to have nexus in a state to collect\/pay sales tax. \n\nLuckily though - this won\u2019t affect most retailers, including most dropshippers. Why? Because the ruling only applies to LARGE retailers who do a lot of sales in that one, single state. For South Dakota, the threshold is you need to be doing either $100,000 in sales or 200+ transactions within South Dakota in a year. For other states to implement thresholds significantly lower, they will have to go through the courts again.\n\nMyth #3: Won\u2019t I Need to Pay Tariffs or Import Duties?! \n\nNo - as a dropshipper, you do not pay tarrifs\/import duties. It is your customer that will be required to pay them. However, there are very few times where orders from Aliexpress will attract import duties, as most countries have a very high package value threshold before they charge tarrifs. In the USA, it is $800. So neither you nor your customer needs to worry about it.\n\nMyth #4: But Don\u2019t I Need to Register a Business to Dropship?!\n\nMost countries\/states in the world will let you sell as a sole proprietor, otherwise known as a sole trader. As a sole proprietor, you do not need to register to start selling online - you can just create a store and start selling. When tax time rolls around, you may need to register for a separate tax ID, but it will depend on your local jurisdiction (please do not ask me what your local rules are, I know a lot about New Zealand\u2019s laws because that is where I live, I don\u2019t know about each individual country\/state). In time you may wish to register a company because there are lots of bonuses and benefits to doing so, but it\u2019s usually not a legal requirement. \n\nMyth #5: Won\u2019t People Track the Store Based on the Address?! \n\nFirstly, customers won\u2019t do this because there is no reason or incentive for them to want to Google the address of your supplier on the package. Secondly, even if the customer did do this, they would probably find nothing: usually the address of the suppliers is not posted online for us to access. And Aliexpress stores do not list their addresses, so customers won\u2019t find the store you bought it from (and thus, not find the price you originally paid). \n\nMyth #6: Won\u2019t the USA\/China Trade War Kill Dropshipping? \n\nDonald Trump\u2019s White House has announced plans on March 22, 2018 to increase tariffs on Chinese imports to discourage people from importing from China. This is unlikely to impact dropshippers though, as the packages we ship are below the tariff threshold in the first place. And there has been no announcement about lowering the threshold - and if it was lowered, it would be unlikely to go below the original threshold of $200. \n\nMyth #7: Wait\u2026 Oberlo Doesn\u2019t Buy the Items for Me? \n\nAlmost. Oberlo semi-automates the process for you by taking control of your screen and in seconds, adding the item to your cart and preparing it for purchase. But you still need to click the \u201cOrder Product\u201d button to do this. And you still need to click the \u201cConfirm and Pay\u201d button on Aliexpress.","publishedAt":"2018-07-02T23:00:02Z","tags":["dropshipping","aliexpress dropshipping","wayfar vs. south dakota","south dakota vs. wayfair","trade war","china trade war","tariffs","import duties","china trade war dropshipping","tarrifs dropshipping","import duties dropshipping","south dakota vs wayfair dropshipping"],"title":"7 Dropshipping MYTHS?!

Let\u2019s examine both models so you can see which store is right for you. Starting with General stores.\n \n*GENERAL STORES*\n \nGeneral stores have two big advantages. 1) they make the most money and 2) they\u2019re less hassle to run in the long-term!\n \nGeneral stores can easily make more money because you have more potential customers for your store. For example: If you build a store around pets, you\u2019d have access to a whole wide range of customers. Making it easier to make a lot more money from one single store.\n \nCompare that to a niche store built around a single type of pet - like dogs. It\u2019s easy to see how narrow your market gets. And the narrower it gets, the less buyers to your store.\n \nGeneral stores also have access to a lot more products - a huge advantage over niche stores. This gives you more room to find winning items for your store. That way, if a current item you\u2019re advertising becomes saturated by competition, you have other proven items to easily swap in.\n \nWith niche stores though, it can get a little complicated. If you build a store too niche, you can run out of products to test because you\u2019ve tested them all already.\n \nThe easy workaround solution would be to build multiple niche stores. But now you\u2019ve run into another problem: how much TIME will that take?\n \nAll of this means, that with a general store, you can earn far more from your one, single store, since you have way more customers to reach out to. And long-term, it\u2019s going to require less work to test new products and find winning items.\n \nBut I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cSarah - why on earth do you recommend niche stores?!\u201d\n \nGreat question. Allow me to explain \u2026\n \n*NICHE STORES*\n \nNiche stores are a great option for two reasons. 1) they make beginners money faster and 2) they\u2019re easier for beginners to convert sales.\nNiche stores make beginners money faster because you can firstly brand your store around your niche.\n \nImagine a cat owner comes into a store - and everything screams \u201cWe LOVE cats\u201d at them. The logo, the name, and even the About Page talking passionately about cats.\n \nWouldn\u2019t it be harder for cat lovers NOT to love a store like this?\n \nThat\u2019s the power of strong branding. It gives your site a personality. Something General stores inevitably have a hard time doing in the early stages.\n \nBranding also lets you tap into a power every store needs to be successful: TRUST.\n \nWhen you can use your branding to connect between you and prospective customers before even talking to them, making sales becomes a lot easier.\n \nAnd what do you get when you have customers that trust you? Higher conversion rates! In other words, the easier it will be to make sales.\n \nNiche stores let you tap into even more money with upsells and cross-sells.\n \nThink about it: When a cat owner comes to your pet site, they\u2019re going to see a lot of items that aren\u2019t relevant to them on the store. They don\u2019t have a fish. They don\u2019t care about those items. They don\u2019t have a dog. They don\u2019t want to buy dog-related items. So, when they click on your homepage, and see these categories teased\u2026 that is not going to be very enticing.\n \nOn the other hand, if they were to click on your homepage, and see that all of the items in the categories being teased were about cats, they\u2019ll be way more excited.\n \nThis makes it easier to do follow-up marketing with emails and social media. Because every time you send out a newsletter, promoting an item, you know that whatever it is, it\u2019ll be relevant to all of your customers.\n \nWhat this all means then is that beginners tend to have success and find winning items faster when they start with niche stores.\n \nAt Wholesale Ted, we\u2019re big advocates of building niche stores because we know that for many of you out there you\u2019re just beginning - and that\u2019s okay!\n \nAnd for beginners, it\u2019s usually a better option to take the \u2018path of least resistance\u2019, which niche stores easily have.\n \nSo ultimately, it comes down to this: scaling your business from 5-figures a month to over 6-figures a month is going to be much easier using the general store strategy.\n \nBut, scaling your business from no dollars a month to 5-figures a month is going to be much easier using the niche store strategy.\n \nEach have their own pros and cons. You have to pick which option is the best for you.","publishedAt":"2018-08-28T23:00:02Z","tags":["general dropshipping store","niche dropshipping store","niche vs. general","general vs. niche","niche vs. general dropshipping","general vs. niche dropshipping","dropshipping","aliexpress","aliexpress.com","aliexpress dropshipping"],"title":"GENERAL vs. NICHE Aliexpress Shopify Store...

If a supplier has been on Alibaba\/Aliexpress for 2-3 years and been scamming people by taking their money and running, they would have been removed by now.\n\nChina enforce very harsh rule for criminals (they\u2019re ranked 5th in the world for enforceable contracts). Any company with history that could be easily tracked by the law enforcement is unlikely going to risk a harsh prison term for some quick cash.\n\nThe great thing about Aliexpress, is you can see how long a supplier\u2019s been online for. Because you\u2019ll be buying items individually on Aliexpress, working with suppliers who have been online for 2+ years is usually more than enough to safeguard yourself.\n\nWith Alibaba however, you\u2019ll be purchasing orders in much larger quantities, so it makes sense to go that inch further. In that case, we recommend purchasing from suppliers who have had a gold subscription for 3+ years. These subscriptions cost thousands every year to maintain, so chances are a scammy supplier wouldn\u2019t be subscribed to this. \n\nTip #2: Be wary of suspicious payment methods\n\nThe biggest red flag is if a supplier asks you to pay in a suspicious way. As a beginner in dropshipping, stick to ordering via Aliexpresses checkout system.\n\nAs your dropshipping business grows, you may move to a different system called CSV bulk dropshipping. This when you download all of your orders from your Shopify store in a CSV format, and send that file to the dropshipper. They\u2019ll take that data, and then fulfill all of the orders for you off Aliexpress. \nFor Alibaba: Stick to paying for orders via Paypal or wire transfers to banks in mainland China . And if a supplier asks you to pay via Western Union - DO NOT work with them.\n\nTip #3: Protect yourself against faulty products\n\nUnfortunately, quality control issues are an unavoidable part of the dropshipping business. To protect yourself from this, only work with suppliers who have a good history of shipping out the product you\u2019re selling. Looking at the product reviews is a great indicator for this, as it shows people have had an excellent buying experience with the supplier. \n\nFor Alibaba, one way you can protect and safeguard yourself is to pay for an order with PayPal.\n\nIf you do this, then you are protected by PayPal\u2019s Dispute program. If you receive bad products, then you know that if you can\u2019t work out some form of compensation with your supplier, that you\u2019ll be able to claim a refund with PayPal.\n\nHere are some additional tips:\n\n#1: Identify your supplier is part of the Trade Assurance program\n\nIf they are, they\u2019ll have the Trade Assurance icon on their listing, which tells you how much you can be protected for if you purchase products through them.\n\n#2: Negotiate with the supplier & create your contract\n\nMake sure you agree on ALL aspects of your order. Including price, shipping dates, and the terms you\u2019ll be covered under Trade Assurance. \n\nAlso ensure your contract includes expectations for your products. For example, the size and materials they should be made out of.\n\n#3: Pay for the item through Alibaba\n\nPay with a telegraphic transfer (e-checking if you\u2019re in the USA). Paying with credit card is also an option. It has fees, but provides you with an additional layer of protection due to chargebacks. \n\nTip #4: Get your products inspected\n\nThis is more targeted towards Amazon FBA sellers who do Private Labelling. Since you\u2019ll be buying in bulk, it makes sense to inspect orders before shipping them to the Amazon FBA warehouse. \n\nIf a product doesn\u2019t pass the quality inspection, you can negotiate with your supplier to fix the problem, or worst-case-scenario, file a dispute with PayPal or Alibaba. Alibaba offers a service that lets you organize an inspector through them, which costs around $200.","publishedAt":"2018-08-21T23:00:00Z","tags":["chinese scams","chinese import scams","aliexpress scams","alibaba scams","how to not get scammed","how to not get scammed when importing from china","alibaba trade assurance program","alibaba trade assurance","trade assurance","faulty products","amazon fba","amazon","amazon fba faulty products","aliexpress","alibaba","alibaba scammers","aliexpress scammers","chinese scammers"],"title":"Chinese Import SCAMS?!

A \u201clow ticket\u201d item would be a low-cost item like a mug. A high-ticket item would be a couch that costs hundreds to thousands of dollars. So a high ticket Shopify dropshipping store might be a furniture store where you sell things like couches, tables and chairs. \n\nQUESTION: Why would you choose to build a high ticket dropshipping store? \n\nThe reason why a lot of people are excited at the idea of this is because you can earn a lot of money from just a single sale. If you make a 30% profit from a $10 sale of a mug, then that is only $3 in profit. Whereas, if you sold a $1,000 couch and made a 30% profit margin, then you would make $300. In theory, it should be easiest to sell a single large item versus a lot of smaller items. \n\nQUESTION: Is it easier to make money from a high ticket dropshipping store? \n\nOur opinion is that for most beginners, they will struggle to make money from selling high ticket items compared to low ticket products. Why? Well it\u2019s because there is a very different mentality of a customer when they come to purchase an expensive product versus a cheaper one. \n\nWhen customers come to purchase expensive items like couches, they do not take those purchases lightly. Spending $1,000 on an item like a couch is a large purchase, and so customers will research their options before they purchase to purchase the best couch.\n\nAnother reason why customers will take a lot of time to research their options is because expensive items like couches tend to be big and bulky. Thus if a customer is looking to purchase one, they will be very analytical in their purchase, as they will need to consider both the logistics of receiving the couch, and in getting rid of their old one. \n\nIt is also very difficult to refund and exchange large, bulky items like this, so customers will be researching their options carefully do that they don\u2019t pick the wrong one. It would also be very expensive and frustrating to purchase a different couch if they didn\u2019t like the first one (let alone the annoyance in having to get rid of the one they didn\u2019t like). So they\u2019ll be researching all of their options carefully to make the right choice the first time. \n\nBecause customers will be researching their options, it means that you\u2019ll now be competing with big brands and stores. For example, if you opened a furniture Shopify store, you\u2019d now be competing against brands like IKEA, Pottery Barn and Ashley Homestore that will show up when customers start to Google and search for their different options. \n\nTo be able to compete with these big brands, you will need to:\n\n#1: Build up enormous trust between you and the potential customer\n\nHigh ticket purchases are a big deal for customers. They will want to be able to trust that they can trust you\u2019ll be selling them a high quaity product, and that it will be delivered to them. Big brands like IKEA already have that trust built up with customers already.\n\n#2: You will need to send the customer through a sales funnel. \n\nA simple, basic Shopify store is not going to be enough. You are going to have to create a much slicker looking store and have an excellent, well writen and designed sales page. You\u2019ll also need to provide a phone number, and be prepared to close sales over the phone. \n\nYou will also need to have a LOT of start-up money set aside as you\u2019ll need to be able to buy these items when customer purchase them. \n\nWhereas, with low ticket dropshipping, you are selling items that cost $15 or less. They are so cheap that a significant group of customers purchase them impulsively, and they don\u2019t do a search to price-check the competition because they think they think the item you\u2019re selling is such a good deal already. This form of dropshipping also requires less start-up money. \n\nFor these reasons, we recommend that unless beginners have a mentor to guide them through the process of setting a store like this up and running one, that they stick to lower cost products.","publishedAt":"2018-08-14T23:00:03Z","tags":["high ticket dropshipping","dropshipping high ticket products","dropshipping high ticket items","selling high ticket products","high ticket products","dropshipping kayaks","dropshipping furniture","shopify furniture store","dropshipping high ticket products on shopify","shopify","aliexpress"],"title":"Do NOT Dropship High Ticket Products ($600 Profit Per Sale?!)

Sort of like having your cake and eating it.\n \nYou might think this is possible if you just get a good job and raise $40,000 in a few years, but there\u2019s the twist: if you\u2019ve got a job, banks won\u2019t lend you the rest of the money. Banks only loan you as much as you make in a year, so to loan $160,000, you\u2019re going to need to earn $160,000. And there are very few jobs that earn this much.\n \nQuite frankly, this is a classic example of how the \u201crich get richer.\u201d  People who earn less have to waste more of their savings on their deposit, losing out on extra money earned by investing it into an appreciable asset. Whereas, those with more money get to invest LESS, and widen their income gap further by getting to invest more of their leftover money into other assets.\n \nSo yes, while you can save up to buy a Lamborghini with a job, most people wouldn\u2019t spend their money that way.\n \nLuckily, there\u2019s another way...START YOUR OWN BUSINESS.\n \nWhen it comes to owning supercars, the only people I know who own these are entrepreneurs and business owners. With jobs, there always an earning cap - since you exchange your time for money. And with only so many hours in a day you can work, once you\u2019ve given all of them, that\u2019s it - you\u2019re sold out. However, with business, you make money through buying OTHER people\u2019s time, then use those people to earn passive income.\n \nOne business we teach subscribers on our channel is Dropshipping. In case you don\u2019t know, Dropshipping is when you open an online store, but you don\u2019t need to purchase any items in-advance - as you only pay for the item AFTER the customer purchases.\n \nInstead of buying stock in advance, you purchase each item individually from a manufacturer who is willing to ship it to your customer for you. Your job is to list the item at a mark-up price on your website, then when you\u2019ve purchased it from the manufacturer, you keep the difference as profit.\n \nAt the start though, you\u2019ll have to give up your free time to set up the store. And it may take a while to start making money since there\u2019s also a learning curve. PLUS, you\u2019re going have to start your business with your own money.\n \nAnd so most people would look at this, and rather spend their evenings doing something like watching Netflix. So, they either give up, or never even try to start their own business.\n \nBut there\u2019s people like Reynard, who doesn\u2019t give up, spends his time and money, and doesn\u2019t stop until he\u2019s built a successful, profitable store. And its people like Reynard that will one day have the money to buy their own Lamborghini.\n \nHow? Let\u2019s say Reynard spends 1-2 hours each day growing his store until it\u2019s making $5,000 a month. He can then go and take $1,500 of that money and hire someone to run the store for him each month instead. Now he\u2019s making $3,500 a month - PASSIVELY. Even as he sleeps, customers come in and purchase items from him.\n \nBut he doesn\u2019t stop there. Now he\u2019s outsourced the running of his store to an employee, he uses the time he\u2019s gained to build ANOTHER store.  Faster this time, as there\u2019s no learning curve and he can just follow the formula he developed. And he builds THAT store up to $5,000 a month.\n \nWhat do you think he does next? Yep, he repeats the process again\u2026and again\u2026and again.\n \nReynard has escaped the trap of spending his time to make money. Instead, he uses MONEY to make MONEY by finding OTHER people willing to exchange THEIR time to earn money.\n \nThe reality is, if you\u2019d like a Lamborghini, then a job isn\u2019t going to get you it. Instead, invest your free time wisely to grow and start a business that can turn into a passive income source. So, one day, you\u2019ll be able to get your very own Lamborghini.","publishedAt":"2018-08-05T07:18:23Z","tags":["buying a lamborghini","how to afford a lamborghini","how to buy a lamborghini","lamborghini","buy a lamborghini","how do people buy lamborghinis","what jobs do lamborghini owners have","affording a lamborghini","being able to buy a lamborghini"],"title":"The Truth About Buying a Lamborghini (How to REALLY Afford a Lamborghini)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXwVZU3_9Kc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXwVZU3_9Kc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXwVZU3_9Kc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXwVZU3_9Kc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXwVZU3_9Kc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"704","dislikeCount":"387","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4834","viewCount":"136434"}},{"id":"d6tQ3rSriBY","snippet":{"description":"Will Donald Trump's escalating Trade War with China kill dropshipping & Amazon FBA?!\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE EBOOK: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba MY DROPSHIPPING COURSE: https:\/\/theecommclubhouse.com \n\nPLEASE NOTE: This channel is politically neutral. We will not talk about any political opinions on it. The comment section however is free for you to sound-off your opinions.\n \nWHAT is a Trade War? For those who don\u2019t know:\n \nIt\u2019s when Country A increases tariffs (import taxes on products imported from country B) to discourage people from importing them in the first place\n\nIn retaliation, Country B increases their tariffs (import taxes on products that they buy from Country A)\n\nWhich becomes a back-and-forth retaliation.\n \nThis is China and USA\u2019s current situation. On June 15th, Donald Trump declared that the US would impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese imported goods in response to unfair trading practices. This was enough to kill profit margins for many sellers - and potentially kill a lot of businesses.\n \nTrump also added if China responded with their own tariffs the US would impose 10% tariffs on an ADDITIONAL $200 billion dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese imported goods. China responded pretty much immediately by imposing their own similar tariffs on US imported goods. Which has now locked both countries into an economic battle.\n \nSo, what does this trade war mean for YOU as an online seller?\n \nIt\u2019s a common assumption that products are cheap in China due to cheap slave labour. And while there\u2019s some truth in this, working conditions have MASSIVELY improved. For example: The Pearl River Delta region of China - notorious for the production of big brand toys - used to have terrible conditions between the 90s - 2000s that left many workers injured. This is much different today where enormous labour reforms have been put in place to protect the rights of the workers.\n \nDue to this, the cost of labour rose, but still remains cheap for online sellers to source products from China. How is this so?\n \n*THE BELT ROAD INITIATIVE*\n \nFor those who don\u2019t know, this is:\n \nChina\u2019s development strategy to create roads, train tracks and shipping ports that connect to Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe Silk Road Economic Belt - a series of 6 land corridors - contains roads and train tracks to connect China to a slew of countries.\n \nThe dark side to this development was its funding strategy. In the past, China loaned $8 billion dollars to a country you\u2019d consider \u201ctoo risky\u201d to loan - Sri Lanka. China knew they most likely WON\u2019T pay this back, but they didn\u2019t mind. They instead used this debt to further their Belt Road Initiative.\n \nAs a result of not being able to pay the debt, the Sri Lanka government made a compromise: They would give them a 70% stake and a 99-year lease of their shipping port, Hambantota, which had been built with money they had initially borrowed from China.\n \nThis made it cheaper and easier for China to export its goods around the world AND import key raw materials, like oil and iron ore. They then turn these raw materials into goods and export them back out again. As a result, this infrastructure network lowers the cost of producing goods, hence why we all import from China.\n \nSo why don\u2019t online sellers need to worry about this Trade War? Well first, China is king of producing common, everyday goods. In fact, the majority of goods imported by the US from China fall under the bracket of \u201ceveryday goods\u201d - like electronics, clothing and kitchenware. And it\u2019s these goods that are similar to what most online sellers focus on.\n \nBut Donald Trump has NO INTENTION to compete with China over these. He doesn\u2019t care about manufacturing everyday goods. What he\u2019s interested in, is competing with China with HIGH-TECH GOODS.\n \nHigh-tech fields like robotics, automobiles, and pharmaceutical products are currently dominated by other countries, including the United States. And THIS is what Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are all about. NOT the types of items most small online sellers import and sell.\n \nRemember back at the beginning of this video when I talked about how the US has imposed 25% tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imported goods? The vast majority of these products include raw materials and industrial goods used in high-tech industries.\n \nDropshipper and Amazon FBA sellers don\u2019t sell these types of goods. And the vast majority of products they DO sell aren\u2019t even on the list. Besides this, import packages need to exceed $800 to be even eligible for tariffs. An amount that most importing packages online sellers make never exceed.\n \nAdditionally, the $200 billion dollar worth of goods that Trump threatened to target in retaliation isn\u2019t much of a threat to online sellers. The majority of products on the list are related to high-tech fields, raw materials or food (which again, has nothing to do with online sellers).","publishedAt":"2018-09-17T22:00:05Z","tags":["donald trump trade war","china trade war","china usa trade war","donald trump tariffs","$200 billion tariffs","donald trump","why are products in china so cheap","the belt road initiative","china belt road initiative","donald trump trade war tariffs","dropshipping tariffs","dropshipping importing duties","amazon fba tariffs","amazon fba donald trump"],"title":"Will Donald Trump's War KILL Dropshipping & Amazon?!

This is NOT official legal advice!\n\nIn this updated video, Sarah discusses what your tax obligations are as a dropshipper after the Wayfair vs. South Dakota Supreme Court ruling. This video is relevant for the following types of sellers:\n\n* They are sourcing items from Chinese dropshippers, such as Aliexpress dropshippers.\n* They are selling to customers that are based in the USA.\n\nPlease note, on this channel we only focus on teaching new dropshippers how to focus on the USA market, which is why we will only discuss your tax obligations when selling to USA based customers. \n\n***What Taxes Do I Need to Pay?***\n\nWhen dropshipping you there are 2 types of taxes to pay:\n\n1) Income tax\n2) Sales tax\n\n***Who Do I Pay Income Tax To?***\n\nYou pay income tax to your local government\/governing body. So if you live in Australia, you will always pay your income tax to the Australian government. It doesn\u2019t matter if your customers are based in the USA: you do not pay income tax to the USA government, you would pay it to the Australian government. \n\n***Do I Need to Collect and Pay Sales Tax?*** \n\nIn the USA, it is states that you need to collect and pay sales tax to - not the federal USA government. Previous to June 2018, there was a law in the USA that meant that you had to have nexus in a state before you were required to collect and pay sales tax in it. Nexus is a legal term that means you have a sufficiently large physical presence in a state to be eligible to collect and pay sales tax. \n\nFor example, if you lived in Arizona then that would be a very large physical presence, and so you would have nexus in it. If a customer comes to your dropshipping store and purchases a mug from you, you would be required to collect and pay sales tax on that order. The sales tax rate in Arizona in 5.6%. You could need to collect this tax on the order and pay it to the Arizona state. \n\nNow let\u2019s imagine that a customer from Texas came to your store. Because you didn\u2019t live there (or have any physical presence in Texas), this means that you didn\u2019t have nexus in Texas. That meant that you were not required to collect sales tax on that order and pay it to the Texas state.\n\nThis also meant that if you were not a USA citizen that you usually did not have nexus in any state, and thus didn\u2019t have to collect\/pay any sales tax at all. \n\nHowever, in June 2018 a Supreme Court ruling (South Dakota vs. Wayfar) changed this. It abolished this law and said that states can now require large out-of-state vendors to have to collect and pay sales tax. So\u2026 does this mean that you now have to collect and pay it even if you don\u2019t have nexus?\n\nNO! It doesn\u2019t. To be required to collect and pay it, the following needs to happen:\n\n1) A state needs to pass a law which overrides the baseline nexus law (most states have not passed a bill yet).\n\n2) You will need to be a large vendor (the current baseline is doing $100,000+ sales in a single state, or 200+ transactions in a year). \n\nFor most established stores, this means that they will likely only have to start collecting and paying sales tax in a small percentage of states - likely the large ones such as New York City. \n\nBUT, if you are a new dropshipper then you do not need to worry about this until you start making a lot of money and making a lot of sales. For now, you only need to collect and pay sales tax on orders made in states that you have nexus in (which for most people, will only apply to the state that they live in). For states to legally pass a bill that targets small vendors, a new Supreme Court case will be required. \n\nWant to find out how to start collecting sales tax on your orders in Shopify?

Sort of like kitchen \u201chacks\u201d designed to make cooking easier.\n \nThe problem was, these so-called kitchen \u201chacks\u201d can often be a trap. For 3 reasons:\n \n1. It\u2019s cheap junk that solves fake problems.\n \nUnfortunately, the creators of these gadgets often invent or create \u201cfake problems\u201d that very few people have as an excuse to sell a product to merchants.\n \nThis anti-soup spill funnel is a prime example. Have I ever tipped soup from a pot and had it spill? Definitely. Did it happen enough that I thought I needed to go buy a piece of plastic to fix the problem? No. Instead I just got better at pouring the soup into my bowl.\n \nUsing the Amazon method I demonstrated in the video is a great way to \u201cverify\u201d whether a product actually solves a problem.\n \n*TIP*: If you want to find products that SELL, make sure they 1) solve a REAL problem or 2) Adds an additional bonus to someone's life.\n \n2. There\u2019s no niche to target your Facebook ads\n \nKitchen is a broad niche, so it\u2019s easy to spread yourself too thin when running ads. Not only is it too broad - but you need to find the right product to promote. And promote it in the right way.\n \nSo what\u2019s the RIGHT way to promote kitchen gadgets? VIDEO ADS!\n \nIf you weren\u2019t shown how any of these gadgets worked, some of them could easily be mistaken for Star Trek props. A video of these items \u201cin action\u201d is the difference between viewers going from \u201cWhat the hell is that thing?\u201d to \u201cSHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!\u201d\n \n*TIP*: Use video when it\u2019s hard to tell what your product does.\n \n3. They are easily available in local stores\n \nFor example, a gadget of yours - a pineapple corer - can easily be found at supermarkets (next to the pineapples). Which makes it seem pretty mundane and reduces its \u201cwow\u201d factor.\n \n*TIP*: Find products that customers won\u2019t easily find elsewhere. This makes it seem rare and exclusive.\n \nAspect #2: Your Strategy When Advertising Products on Facebook\n \nMy first concern was how low you\u2019d priced your items for. As a rule of thumb, I recommend selling your items at 3x the price of its cost. This leaves you a 30-15% profit per sale after expenses.\n \nExample: A mug costs $3 and sold for $9. For most winning items, \u00bd of the revenue from the sale goes towards advertising costs (your Facebook ad). So when we deduct the advertising expense ($4.50) plus the cost to buy the mug ($3) - we\u2019re left with a profit of $1.50.\n \nNow let\u2019s do the math with one of the products you\u2019re selling: Vegetable slicers.\n \nYou currently sell this in your store for $6. On AliExpress, the cost to buy a vegetable slicer is $2.75. When you deduct advertising costs plus the price of the item, you\u2019re left with just $0.25 profit. Which isn\u2019t even close to making a \u201cdecent\u201d profit. \n \n*TIP*: Go through and check the prices of your items to make sure that they are priced high enough to be profitable.\n \nAspect #3: Your Store Design and Branding\n \nHere\u2019s the brutal truth: Your store lacks in branding and purpose.\n \nIt\u2019s clear that your store is designed to solve annoying problems and make cooking easier using kitchen \u201chacks.\u201d Yet, you fail mention ANY of this on your site.\n \nInstead, you talk about how you\u2019re here to help people \u201cdesign a kitchen\u201d in \u201ctheir own way.\u201d\n \n*TIP*: Change the language on the site to not only reflect WHAT you\u2019re selling, but to make it look like you\u2019re passionate about it too.\n \nOn the plus side though, you did an awesome job in adding trust badges and emphasizing the benefits in your product description copy.\n \nBut now to take your store from \u201cgood\u201d to \u201cgreat\u201d - consider the following areas:\n \n*Your trust emblems are placed awkwardly. Align them to the left with the text and \u201cbuy\u201d button to give it that professional look\n \n*Get rid of ANY low quality images in your product listing that look pixelated. You can often find it just by doing a Google image search for the title of the AliExpress item you want to sell.\n \n*Add a favicon to your store. A great image for that would be your logo image.

Instead, Sarah takes a look at them to see if they are legally compliant (and spoiler - they aren\u2019t!). Here are the mistakes they made: \n\nMISTAKE #1: Selling Copyrighted Products \n\nThe first store that Sarah reviewed (Scoops World Online) was making a HUGE mistake by selling phone cases that featured copyrighted photos, pictures, characters and trademarked logos (and yes - photos can contain copyrights as well!). \n\nOn Aliexpress, a lot of sellers will sell items that contain copyrighted pictures and characters, and sell items that contain logos that are trademarked. A lot of people make the mistake that surely these manufacturers are only selling them if they have the right to do so? But unfortunately, they almost always don\u2019t. The reason why they do it is because they know that they can get away with it, not because they have the right to do so. \n\nIt\u2019s very tempting to sell items that feature copyrighted characters\/trademarks because they sell extremely well. The reason why they sell extremely well is because companies like Disney have poured enormous amounts of money into making them super popular. That is why they protect their copyrights\/trademarks: they want to capitalize on that popularity and keep all of that money for themselves! \n\nHowever, this does lead to another question that we get asked a lot\u2026\n\nQUESTION: Can I Sell Items that Contain Chinese Manufacturers Names? \n\nYES! Yes you can. There is NOTHING wrong with selling items that contain copyrights or trademarks, as long as you acquired those items LEGALLY. So you can tell a Captain America action figure, as long as you acquired it from a source that either produced it legally, or bought it legally. \n\nThe problem with Chinese manufacturers is they usually did not produce their Captain America phone cases legally in the first place, which makes the items illegal - and thus, it makes it illegal for you to purchase them and resell them. If the manufacturers had produced them legally, it would be legal for you to sell them. \n\nSo when a Chinese manufacturer places their brand\/logo on an item (e.g. the manufacturer Transhome likes to put the name of their factory - Transhome - on their products) it\u2019s absolutely fine to buy and resell that, as they had the right to make that item in the first place. \n\nMISTAKE #2: Not Having a Refund Policy Page \n\nThe second store that Sarah reviewed (Doggo Trend) did not have a refund policy page anywhere on the website. This is a big problem because it means that if the customer wants to return an item for an illegitimate reason (e.g. they bought the wrong sized shirt) that you can\u2019t point to a refund policy page and say, we don\u2019t accept refunds if you purchase the wrong size, and we made this clear before you bought it. The customer now has an opening to argue with you that they should receive a refund - which increases the chances that they\u2019ll try to do something like file a dispute with PayPal.\n\nAnd yes: you would probably win that dispute. But now your seller metrics have been negatively impacted. Be sure to protect yourself with a refund policy page. \n\nMISTAKE #3: Not Including a Shipping Time Disclaimer \n\nWhen dropshipping from Aliexpress, the shipping times can be 10-20 days long with epacket to the USA. This is an abnormally high shipping time. It is not fair to the customer to not warn them that the shipping times are going to be long. The third store that Sarah reviewed, Kokosale, did NOT include a shipping time disclaimer on their product pages. This is very concerning: you should include a note (and we recommend bolding it) saying that shipping will take either 2-3 weeks, or 2-4 weeks to be safe. \n\nIf you do not warn the customer, they could get very upset and legitimately ask for a refund, file a PayPal dispute or file a chargeback. And the chances are, you will lose that dispute because you were engaging in shady practices. So don\u2019t try to hide the shipping times - set the expectation for the customer. Be upfront and let them know!","publishedAt":"2018-10-24T21:58:23Z","tags":["getting sued when dropshipping","sued when dropshipping","dropshippers sued","dropshippers being sued","selling copyrighted products","copyrighted products","legally dropshipping","refund policy page","refund policy page dropshipping","long shipping times","dropshipping with long shipping times","epacket shipping"],"title":"Dropshippers Getting SUED?!

The short answer: It can. The long answer? It can - but if you're not careful, it can have the opposite effect. \n\u25ba\u25ba Watch this to learn more: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=juO4zxsjSjw\n\nIt\u2019s a scientific fact that spending money on material things doesn\u2019t make us happy. However, using your money to buy back your TIME allows you to spend more time with friends, family and pursuing hobbies.\n \nThis means spending money on things like:\n \nHiring a cleaner\nHiring someone to mow the front lawn\nHaving a chef prepare your meals\nHiring a nanny to take care of your kids\n \nBuying back our time allows us to focus on the things we truly LOVE. And this has a direct, positive impact on happiness.\n \nQUESTION: Why Do Billionaires & Athletes Get Depressed?\n \nThis can be explained using the hedonic treadmill as an example. You see, this is the scientifically observed tendency where all of us quickly return to a stable level of happiness. For example: If you won the lottery tomorrow, you\u2019d get a HUGE boost of happiness. You\u2019d be super happy. But eventually, you\u2019ll return to your previous, baseline happiness level. Long-term it doesn\u2019t matter.\n \nMost athletes and entrepreneurs fall into this trap. After reaching a goal, they enjoy the rush of happiness and achievement. After a while though, that goal becomes normalized, so they try and reach bigger goals to achieve that sense of happiness again.\n \nWhat we\u2019re really doing (without realising), is associating success with happiness. And this is where we get trapped running our own hedonic treadmill.\n \nThis is dangerous. You may have noticed that in the entrepreneurial community, there is a LOT of peer pressure to be always working. Always hustling. HOWEVER, this mindset can eventually result in something that is the total opposite: BURNOUT.\n \nA Swedish study showed that when we work, we fire different neurons in our brain. So of course, the more work we do, the more we engage them. However, doing this too much leads our brain to try and work more efficiently. So, it goes into survival mode and starts to rewire your brain so that your neurons start fire TOGETHER. This means it becomes harder to access different parts of your brain, such as the parts involved problem solving, focus, and emotional reasoning.\n \nQUESTION: How Can You Experience Happiness Every Day?\n \nWhile we get a big dose of happiness when something big happens, science has also shown that little things make us almost just as happy.\n \nFor example:\n \nEating a nice apple\nGiving someone a hug\nExercising and treating your body right\nDrinking a nice cup of coffee\n \nThe difference though, is that the happiness boost from these little things doesn\u2019t last as long as the big ones. So, the key is to add lots and lots of these nice, little things into your life every day.\n \nIndirectly, this is also a sense of gratitude: The quality of being THANKFUL. And is an awesome way of experiencing genuine happiness from the INSIDE OUT. Rather than the outside in.","publishedAt":"2018-10-13T23:00:03Z","tags":["depression","anixety","depression and anxiety","does money buy happiness","happiness and money","does wealth buy happiness","mental health awareness week","depression awareness","hedonic treadmill","hedonic adaption"],"title":"My Struggle With Money, Depression & Anxiety (Does Money Buy Happiness?)

Here are 10 of our best psychological \u201ctriggers\u201d that you can use in your store today to increase sales and conversions.\n \nTrigger #1: Incite Customers to Buy by Giving Them Something for Free\n \nWhen you give a customer a freebie like a coupon, we trigger the social norm of reciprocity. When someone does something nice to us, we feel a strong obligation to return the favour.\n \nUse personalized coupons that offer someone a unique discount. For Amazon sellers, include a coupon inside the customers packaging.\n \nTrigger #2: Create Envy with Customer Reviews\n \nCustomer reviews help to create envy in your prospective customers.\n \nIf we see our neighbours benefiting from something, we become envious and want to receive this benefit too. And so that\u2019s what positive product reviews do.\n \nIf you\u2019ve got a Shopify store, include a review app like Stamped.io that asks customers to leave a review. For Amazon sellers, use Jump Send which also automatically emails your customers asking them to leave a review.\n \nTrigger #3: Use Curiosity to Drive Traffic & Engagement\n \nCuriosity should feel like an itch you NEED to scratch.\n \nThe spin-to-win coupon pop-up box is again a good example of this. And for Amazon sellers, a great way to add curiosity to your marketing strategy is to be creative with the review request email titles you use e.g.  \u201cI have a favour that I\u2019d like to ask you?\u201d instead of just asking for a review.\n \nTrigger #4: Use Photos to Help Customers Visualize\n \nIf you run an online store, don\u2019t just include the basic photos of a product against a white backdrop. Instead, look for photos that the supplier has provided showing it in a real-life context. And if the supplier doesn\u2019t have these, consider buying a test product and taking your own photos. The same applies to if you sell on Amazon.\n \nTrigger #5: Use Photos to Create Emotions in Customers\n \nIf you run an online store, be sure to include pictures of people using the product and - more importantly - ENJOYING themselves using it too!\n \nTrigger #6: Use Price Anchoring to Push Prices Higher\n \nPrice anchoring is when you place two products with different prices side-by-side, and it\u2019s most effective when there are at least 3 pricing tiers. Most people pick the middle-price product. It looks cheap compared to the expensive option, but people will assume it\u2019s higher quality than the cheap option. It\u2019s the comfortable compromise.\n \nTrigger #7: Include Product Pictures with Human Faces\n \nSimilar to trigger #6, this trigger uses humans - particularly the face - as a way of increasing sales conversions. Consider purchasing a test product and taking your own photo with the item.\n \nTrigger #8: Pain Is More Motivating Than Pleasure\n \nPain is a stronger motivator than pleasure. In your product descriptions, emphasize how your product can remove a pain point that a prospective customer is experiencing (and wants to get rid of).\n \nTrigger #9: Create a Common Enemy\n \nEssentially, this is creating an \u201cUs vs. Them\u201d attitude against a competitor you have. Look at your market or niche you are selling in: Who is your common enemy? Identify who they are and position your product against them.\n \nTrigger #10: Phrase Your Prices as Low\n \nWhen you emphasize how low your prices are using words like \u201conly\u201d and \u201cjust\u201d, conversions and sales always increase. When you\u2019re phrasing your pricing in marketing materials, don\u2019t be afraid to verbally minimize the price e.g. \u201cIt costs just $9.\u201d","publishedAt":"2018-11-12T22:00:03Z","tags":["sales psychology","law of reciprocity","sales tricks","sales hacks","how to increase sales","increase conversions","make more sales","improve conversions","conversions","price anchoring","how to sell","how to sell online"],"title":"10 Psychological Triggers to MAKE PEOPLE BUY From YOU!

The real reason is actually rather simple: They take advantage of their credit card miles.\n\nIf you can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a credit card that gives you lots of rewards, then you can accrue huge amounts of miles. This is what you call \u201ccredit card churning.\u201d\n\nHowever, doing this will require you to spend thousands of dollars on a credit card (which obviously, not everyone has the luxury of doing). That is why you need to be able to spend lots of money on the credit card, without actually \u201closing\u201d that money or \u201cspending\u201d it in the traditional way.\n\nAnd how do you do that? By using an American Express Explorer Card (AMEX). For those who don\u2019t know, AMEX is a type of credit card that rewards you with flight miles each time you spend money on the card.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you wanted to fly from New York to Singapore. If you booked this flight in cash it would cost you $10,759.72 (Pretty darn expensive, right?). However, with an AMEX card, for every $1 you spend, you earn 2 AMEX points. These can be transferred to Singapore Airlines frequent flyer program, KrisFlyer. \n\n2 AMEX points will get you 1.5 Singapore Krisflyer miles. So that means that if you spend $80,000 on your American Explorer Card, you\u2019ll get 160,000 AMEX points, which if you transferred to Singapore Airlines - would be 120,000 Miles!\n\n\u201cBut Sarah\u201d, you might say, \u201cI\u2019m not even rich enough to be able to spend $80,000 on a credit card?!\u201d.\n\nBut being \u201crich\u201d enough to spend $80,000 from your own pocket is far from the case when learning to fly free. \n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a much, much smarter solution: building a business that allows you to spend money on your credit card, to make money back!\n\nWhen building a business - let\u2019s say an AliExpress dropshipping store  - there\u2019s a number of expenses you\u2019ll need to pay for: Shopify, Facebook advertising, plus the items you\u2019ll be purchasing from AliExpress and selling for a higher price in your store.\n\nThe great thing is, all of these expenses can be paid with a credit card! The easiest and most effective way to build up free flight miles, without having to spend thousands of dollars yourself.\n\nThat means if you were spending $10,000 per month on expenses on a credit card, you\u2019d also earn an additional 20,000 AMEX points. And if we transfer those to Singapore Airlines, we\u2019d be earning 15,000 miles with them each month. \n\nOver a year, that would be 180,000 points. And 180,000 points gets us 1 \u00bd first class flights from the New York to Singapore - the equivalent of over $16,000 in FREE premium flights. \n\nThe reality is: When you go to a job, you spend your time to make money - but get zero reward for this. But with a business, you focus on spending your MONEY to make money instead. And this DOES get rewarded. It gets rewarded with free travel around the world!","publishedAt":"2018-12-20T00:22:21Z","tags":["first class","flying first class","flying business class","singapore airlines a380 first class","emirates a380 first class","air miles","credit card churning","churning","business class","free flights","flying free"],"title":"The Truth About Flying FIRST CLASS (Flying for FREE in Business Class & First Class)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAikfEMh2K0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAikfEMh2K0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAikfEMh2K0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAikfEMh2K0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAikfEMh2K0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"394","dislikeCount":"276","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2911","viewCount":"124842"}},{"id":"OqRpUTTkQmk","snippet":{"description":"5 Print On Demand Tips that 6-figure & 7-figure stores use to scale their stores! \n\u25ba\u25ba PREMIUM PRINT ON DEMAND COURSE: https:\/\/theecommclubhouse.com\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE EBOOK DOWNLOAD: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\n***OTHER LINKS MENTIONED IN THE VIDEO***\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Dropshippers Getting Sued: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DZp3MG7qIkk \n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nWATCH OUR MOST POPULAR VIDEOS:\r\n\r\n\u25ba\u25ba How I Made $1000\/Day At Age 15 [Animated]: https:\/\/youtu.be\/kd7bS68o4gA\r\n\u25ba\u25ba 5 Ways To Make Money Online If You Are BROKE: https:\/\/youtu.be\/KRSMH-mvVa0\r\n\u25ba\u25ba 3 Ways To Turn $50 Into $100\/Day: https:\/\/youtu.be\/YF3nUXhYAzE\r\n\u25ba\u25ba 10 Psychological Triggers Used To Make People Buy [Animated]: https:\/\/youtu.be\/iDdgZbQJ1mA  \r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED WATCHING - Having Realistic Expectations In Business:\r\n\u25ba\u25bahttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OQ8WOBW3lGc&list=PLjNYIrpZp6BhzPiUJUUrpfIaFTlcZKF5n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA! \r\n\r\n\u25ba\u25ba Follow Sarah's Adventures on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sarahchrispy\/\r\n\u25ba\u25ba Like us on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wholesaleted\/\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nWHY SUBSCRIBE TO WHOLESALE TED? \nA business isn't a way to get rich fast.

You list your items for sale and people buy it. IT\u2019s super profitable, as over 35 million people come and buy items from stores on Etsy.\n \nThe model involves selling stuff like t-shirts and mugs with popular word art, leveraging a print-on-demand service like Printify. This is a Shopify app that prints designs onto various items for your store. When someone comes to your store and orders an item, Printify will be notified of the order. From here, they print the design onto a plain t-shirt and ship it to the customers address from their warehouse.\n \nBasic, white designs with word-art sell super well on Etsy because they make fun gifts for friends & family and the phrases used as word-art are already in-trend.\n \nStep #1: Find Highly Popular, Trendy Phrases\/Jokes that are Selling Well\n \nStudy your competitors stores by identifying which of their designs are generating most of their sales. To do this: type inside your browser search functionality and type in \u201cpeople have added this to their cart.\u201d All of the items added to people\u2019s carts would\u2019ve been highlighted so you can easily identify them and sift through them.\n \nFocus on designs that are PURELY simple word art. IGNORE designs that feature images.\n \nStep #2: Repurpose Popular Designs for FREE Using Photoshop\n \nReplicate and repurpose text based art using Photoshop ($9.99\/month) or GIMP.\n \nThis isn\u2019t copying. Instead, your aim is to make variations of the same product, by modifying the font, font size, colour and orientation of the word art.\n \nEach time you list an item on Etsy it costs you 20 cents, and item stays up on the site for free for 4 months. Our aim is to get to a total of 100 products to \u201ctest\u201d and see which are the most popular (making the most sales). So, to do this, create a list of 10 products a day in your spare time using this strategy.\n \nFrom here, following the Printify tutorial outlined in the video, push the products you created using Printify and add them to your store.\n \nStep #3: Use Search Engine Optimization Techniques in Your Listing\n \nType in the search bar your main keyword for your niche, then take note of all the keywords that show up under auto-suggest. For example, if you typed PHD as Sarah showed in the video - you can see relevant keywords like \u201cPHD gift\u201d and \u201cPHD graduation gift\u201d people are typing in the search bar.\n \nTake the keywords you\u2019ve taken note of and use add them to your product listing as \u2018tags.\u2019 This includes your title and product description. Don\u2019t forget to also add the specific phrase\/joke you\u2019re using. Consumers hardly read titles on Etsy, they focus on the images, so feel free to keyword stuff.\n \n(EXTRA TIP: When writing your description, don\u2019t just put two lines of text. Spend time and look at top selling stores and base your description off of what they do so that it looks professional and trustworthy.)\n \n*The next 3 BONUS steps do require an additional $80 to start, pushing our $20 start-up to $100*\n \n#4: Create Discount Coupons for Your Item and Give it to Your Friends\n \nGo to the coupon creator inside your Etsy account and apply a 99% off coupon to your product with a no order minimum requirement. Give the coupon to your friends and make sure they create their own Etsy accounts.\n \n#5: Have 5 Friends Each Buy a Different Product from Your Store Using a Search Keyword.\n \nHave your friends sign into their Etsy accounts, go to the search bar, and type in the keyword you\u2019re trying to target. Once they\u2019ve scrolled through the results until and found your mug, get them to click on it.\n \n#6: Have them Buy the Item Immediately Using the Discount Coupon & Reimburse them\n \nHave your friends immediately buy your item without leaving the page. This will indicate to Etsy your product has a high conversion rate of people landing on your item listing to then purchasing it. And as a result, Etsy will push your product closer to the top of the search results!\n \nThe discount coupon will drastically drop sales fees. And you can reimburse them the cost of the item and shipping they paid.\n \n#4: Get them to leave a review with a photo  \n \nAsk your friends to leave a review and upload a photo of the item they purchased with it. (Hopefully they will leave a 5\/5 star positive review!)","publishedAt":"2019-01-10T23:00:00Z","tags":["make $100 a day","free traffic","$100 a day","make $100","print on demand","print on demand tutorial","etsy","etsy print on demand","etsy search engine optimization","etsy tutorial","printify","printify.com","printify tutorial"],"title":"How to Make $100\/DAY with FREE Traffic (TUTORIAL) - Print On Demand Tutorial with Etsy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AdT1ffAg1Fw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AdT1ffAg1Fw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AdT1ffAg1Fw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AdT1ffAg1Fw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AdT1ffAg1Fw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT21M10S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"904","dislikeCount":"216","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10111","viewCount":"295450"}},{"id":"kyOCh1m88UY","snippet":{"description":"Sarah reveals the top 5 online businesses to make money (& change your life!) in 2019.\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE EBOOK: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba PREMIUM DROPSHIPPING COURSE: https:\/\/thedropshipclub.com \n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nWATCH OUR MOST POPULAR VIDEOS:\r\n\r\n\u25ba\u25ba How I Made $1000\/Day At Age 15 [Animated]: https:\/\/youtu.be\/kd7bS68o4gA\r\n\u25ba\u25ba 5 Ways To Make Money Online If You Are BROKE: https:\/\/youtu.be\/KRSMH-mvVa0\r\n\u25ba\u25ba 3 Ways To Turn $50 Into $100\/Day: https:\/\/youtu.be\/YF3nUXhYAzE\r\n\u25ba\u25ba 10 Psychological Triggers Used To Make People Buy [Animated]:  https:\/\/youtu.be\/iDdgZbQJ1mA\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED WATCHING - Having Realistic Expectations In Business:\r\n\u25ba\u25bahttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OQ8WOBW3lGc&list=PLjNYIrpZp6BhzPiUJUUrpfIaFTlcZKF5n\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA! \r\n\r\n\u25ba\u25ba Follow Sarah's Adventures on Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/sarahchrispy\/\r\n\u25ba\u25ba Like us on Facebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wholesaleted\/\r\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\r\nWHY SUBSCRIBE TO WHOLESALE TED?\nA business isn't a way to get rich fast.

Includes both FREE traffic & paid traffic methods.\n\u25ba\u25ba FREE $10,000\/Month eBook: http:\/\/wholesaleted.com\/4-step\n\u25ba\u25ba STEP-BY-STEP Dropshipping Training Course: https:\/\/thedropshipclub.com\n\n***OTHER VIDEOS REFERENCED***\n \nPick MONEY MAKING Products to Dropship: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j3QzPy6Mcok&t=26s\nInterview with Fred Lam: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fKSalHjKhjc\nInterview with Adrian Morrison: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x3m8cGu-EBk\nLaunch Your First Amazon FBA Product: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JPwscpE-53g\nMake $100\/DAY with FREE Traffic (on Etsy): https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AdT1ffAg1Fw\n \nTraffic Source #1: Facebook Advertising\n \nFacebook Ads are the kind of ads you see as you\u2019re scrolling through your newsfeed on Facebook. They\u2019re beginner friendly, an \u201call-around\u201d traffic source and can be used to sell anything \u2014 while having the benefit of being low-cost and easy to use.\n \nEven better, is you don\u2019t need to be an expert to see results. Essentially, you just tell the Facebook ads algorithm what you want to achieve, who your ideal customer is, give them your ad image, video and text \u2014 and let them do the rest.\n \nAnd then you can choose who EXACTLY you want to target with your ads. Because Facebook has so much data on its users, you can get very specific about who you want to target.\n \nWhether promoting low-cost items, driving traffic to an upcoming webinar, or trying to increase engagement on one your site\u2019s articles, Facebook is a highly effective, yet easy-to-understand traffic source we highly recommend beginners use.\n \nTraffic Source #2: Search Engine Traffic (SEO)\n \nWhile SEO is more on the technical side, the concept is rather basic.\n \nWhen you type in a keyword (for example, \u2018make money\u2019) into a search engine like Google, you get back millions of results related to this keyword.\n \nGoogle shows these results based on relevancy. For example, if an article from a blog featured the keyword \u2018make money,\u2019 this would be in a way signalling to Google\u2019s algorithm that this blog is probably related to the search term \u2018make money.\u2019 So based off of this relevancy, Google will rank this website high within the search results for this keyword!\n \nThe downside is while search engine traffic is free, \u201cgaming\u201d the algorithm to earn this free traffic is rather a challenge.\n \nA while ago, Google used to select the best results based on keyword relevancy. This however got watered down when people started to \u2018keyword stuff\u2019 their sites with the aim of appearing more relevant to Google\u2019s algorithm.\n \nNow Google is much smarter, ranking in the search engine is focused on a rather subtle factor that cannot be easily gamed: Backlinks.\n \nTraffic Source #3: Instagram Ads\n \nWhile Instagram is owned by Facebook \u2014 it is a totally different monster.\n \nWith Facebook, long ad copy texts work super well and receive high engagement from users. Instagram, however, is VISUAL \u2014 and so visual ads like video stories work much better.\n \nThe best part? More and more, Instagram ads are becoming more effective than Facebook ads, once you know how to sell the right product.\n \nAnother \u2018perk\u2019 with Instagram ads is they share the same user interface with Facebook for creating ads, making it easy-to-understand and use (even on your first go!).\n \nTraffic Source #4: YouTube Videos\n \nGiven Wholesale Ted has 250,000+ (at this point of time), it\u2019s fair to say YouTube is a great way of driving traffic.\n \nAt Wholesale Ted, we create videos built around search terms people are looking for \u2014 like \u201chow to create a shopify store.\u201d These videos can be tutorials showing viewers step-by-step how build a store; or review videos where we talk about the features, pros and cons, and give our own personal opinion on a product or service we believe our subscribers would benefit from.\n \nTo monetize this video, we add an affiliate link to the description \u2014 then as a \u2018thank you\u2019 for the value we have provided through our video, people use our link to purchase the product or service we recommend. When the person buys through our link we earn a commission.\n \nTraffic Source #5: Google AdWords\n \nDifferent to Google, Google AdWords is a program whereby you pay Google to have your ad shown for a particular keyword.\n \nThese ads are extremely powerful, not only because Google is the biggest search engine in the world, but because these ads are SUPER targeted.\n \nThe downside to this is that bidding for competitive keywords drive the bidding price up, making your ad more expensive to show.\n \nWhile this also minimizes the profit you can make from selling cheap low-cost items, like in Aliexpress dropshipping\u2026\n \n...it is a GOLD MINE for selling high-ticket items like couches, kayaks \u2014 plus other type of items like electronic devices.","publishedAt":"2019-02-20T23:01:42Z","tags":["traffic sources","traffic sources for 2019","facebook ads","instagram ads","google adwords","SEO","search engine optimization","etsy","amazon","youtube","facebook vs. google","facebook vs. instagram","adrian morrison","fred lam","bren davis","online traffic","facebook"],"title":"Top 5 Traffic Sources To Make SALES & $$$ (FREE Traffic & Paid Traffic Methods)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/imw7RCSuT-4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/imw7RCSuT-4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/imw7RCSuT-4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/imw7RCSuT-4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/imw7RCSuT-4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT25M32S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"463","dislikeCount":"225","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8644","viewCount":"249084"}},{"id":"Fsq6ohxLQX4","snippet":{"description":"Watch our massively updated for 2019 Shopify Aliexpress Dropshipping tutorial now!

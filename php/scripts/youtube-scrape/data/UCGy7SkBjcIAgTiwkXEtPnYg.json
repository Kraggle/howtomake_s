I started in January of this year, I always wondered about how to work from home - could it really be true? Can you really make a living and build wealth making videos online? I quit my job, and started YouTube, with no backup plan. That was not smart. Instead of investing in the stock market or dividends, I chose to invest in myself. There are many roads to financial independence. It was a rough start.\n\nIn January - I made $0, my click through rate (CTR) was non existent, I didn't understand how to do thumbnails and titles. \n\nIn February - I made $0 - slowly learning how to structure my investing videos about compound interest, stock market, dividends, robinhood, etc.\n\nIn March - $90.48, but it's not enough for YouTube to pay you ($100 is the minimum). I earned $0 in March.\n\nIn April - I made $1511.57. I had ONE video go viral and get a ton of views. Even though the income is higher, I wasn't paid anything in April because YouTube pays one month behind, which was $90.I earned nothing, four months in.\n\nIn May - I made $1923.07, I had another video go crazy called how I made 781.47 with Robinhood Dividends, where I showed my income from my dividend investments. This was the turning point in realizing that some videos pay more depending on your topic. Personal finance, financial minimalism, finance, credit cards, brokerages, etc. pay a lot more money than most other topics on YouTube.\n\nIn June - $2558.13, I learned ANOTHER lesson that I didn\u2019t know about before. I learned I could monetize my videos by placing ads in the middle of my videos. I went back and placed mid-roll ads in every video I could find.\n\nSo far, I've made $6,083.25. Far surpassing my $1000 of income goal in 2019, but that translates into $5.07 per hour working as much as I have 6 months in. Almost less than half the minimum wage.\n\nIn July - I made $3,895.60, I noticed a direct correlation between monetization and views.\n\nIn August - $5808.33. This is replacing my \u201cincome\u201d from what I was earning at my job at this point. \n\nIn September - $14,879.04, my first five figure month. I started earning between $20-$30 for every one thousand views. My investment of my time is now starting to have a huge compound interest effect.\n\nIn October - another 5 figure month. $11,622.\n\nIn November - $30,782.18. This is unbelievable. I just made someone's annual salary in one month. Incredible.\n\nIn December - $41,080.62. I'm speechless. I'm glad I quit my day job.\n\nNext is Patreon, where you can find my spreadsheet that keeps track of your stock investments, shows your dividend stocks, and more. I've made $14,104 from Patreon.\n\nAmazon Links - $1941\n\nAffiliate Marketing - $54,508.27 (I just started affiliate marketing 3 months ago, unbelievable income source so far).\n\nDividend Income - $7005.85\n\nShopify Income - $7,704.66\n\nMy total income for 2019 has just passed $200,000 (I don't have the exact amount, but it's slightly above $200k). I'm so glad I quit my day job to take a chance. None of this would be possible without my dividend investment that gave me courage, and YOU for watching my videos. Thank you so much. \n\n2020, I would love to do a course and sponsored videos as additional sources of income.\n\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I also never made more than roughly 60K a year in base salary working for my previous employer. Still, I was able to save and grow my savings into a six figure dividend machine that pays me money every month to passively exist.

Borrow a card, vanish it and show both hands EMPTY - make it reappear at the tips of your fingers. Then, vanish it once more and have it appear inside your mouth! The best part? You can do this with a credit card. This is one of my favorite card moves of all time.\n\nWelcome to the \"Invest in Yourself - Cardistry and Magic Edition\" series. In these episodes, I will showcase and teach cardistry or a magic sleight whilst teaching it to my friends and family. This way, I get to learn alongside everyone and try to correct the problems YOU may encounter.\n\nWhat kind of an investment channel would this be if I didn't teach some dope cardistry and magic? Beyond investing in the stock market (dividends), it's equally important to invest in YOURSELF. Grab a deck of cards, and let's get started.\n\nLegal Disclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor.

Reason #2: Robinhood cryptocurrency trading is NOT free, there are hidden costs involved as I point out in their crypto user agreement. Usually, Robinhood Stocks are FREE to buy and sell (that's how I invest with dividends), Bitcoin on robinhood on the other hand, is NOT free. \n\nLegal Disclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor.

Similar to Tether, it's aimed at crypto investors who want to take their cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and provide them with a safe haven to transfer into something more stable. In turn, Facebook hopes to raise more than ONE BILLION dollars from it's investors such as Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Spotify, Uber, Lyft, Stripe, Coinbase and many more.

Retirement planning doesn't have to be difficult. There are 3 simple steps we can take to investing our money and getting back up to speed. The good news, is that 50 years old is still considered young in my perspective. You don't have to be old and broke. Here are the 3 steps to retire.\n\nStep 1 - get money. That's an obvious one that most retirement and personal finance guides are missing. We can do this one of two ways, increasing our income or boosting our savings rate. Start shopping around for competitive rates on everything you pay bills on. This includes, your internet, tv services, memberships, insurances, etc. Next, take up some side hustles on the weekends. The video shows the best side hustles you can do.\n\nStep 2 - Invest. Forget dividend stocks, and\/or chasing the next hot stocks in the market. Instead, open up any qualified employer sponsored retirement programs such as 401k, IRA (Roth or Traditional), and\/or an HSA. Start maximizing your contribution to the maximum limit. Money you put in here will be better than investing in individual stocks because the rate of return on your money is 100%. Find out our employer's 401k matching limit and max it out.\n\nSpecifically, find a plan that has a target date of 2035. I recommend Vanguard's VTTHX ( Vanguard Target Retirement 2035 Fund ). This is one of the best index funds of the broader market with low fees, automatic rebalancing, and massive diversification. Vanguard: https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/mutual-funds\/profile\/VTTHX\n\nStep 3 - Emergency Savings. Let's protect your nest egg in case of an emergency. During the last recession of '08, as many as 46% who lost their jobs during the unemployment spike liquidated their 401k to pay for necessities. Don't make this same mistake. This can be avoided by doing some preparation work ahead of time and building an emergency savings fund of at least $ 1,000.\n\nWatch the rest of the video to find out more details.\n\nLegal Disclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor.

This is the ultimate beginner guide to repairing, fixing, and building your credit score. First, take a look at some of the lesser known benefits of credit card perks to get you excited, and once you're ready, let's increase your credit score!\n\nStep 1: Get yourself a secured credit card whether your score is non existent or you want to fix bad credit. Here are the best credit cards to do that with,\n\nOption A: Capital One Secured: https:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/credit-cards\/secured-mastercard\/ (NOTE: unlike the Discover It Secured, this card has a lower minimum but does NOT have a feature to \"review\" and apply for a non secured credit card, which means you'll have to manually close your account to get your deposit back after establish credit)\n\nOption B: Discover It Secured: https:\/\/www.creditcards.com\/credit-cards\/discover-it-secured-card\/ (NOTE: I recommend going with this card if you have more cash for their security deposit because they have an automatic 8th month review period where you can go unsecured if you follow the steps to credit card building in the video)\n\nStep 2: Learn how to use these cards to build your score and which factors affect your credit score. There are 5 different factors and categories responsible for your credit score, the video starts explaining at the 7:03 minute mark)\n\nStep 3: Check your credit score! You can do this by performing a \"soft inquiry\" either on the online credit card site, or by downloading the free Credit Karma app. Alternatively, go to annualcreditreport.com to get your free credit report (the only federally authorized source that allows you to check for free)\n\nStep 4: Do the steps laid out within the video and your fico score should shoot up in a matter of months. Congratulations! This is how we were able to fix and repair our credit score using the best secured credit cards\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Since I'm a dividend investor who's looking to build passive income, the fluctuating stock prices of the market do not affect my income. So even though it looks like I lost money on paper, I'm able to continue investing. As a stock price fluctuates, the dividend yield adjusts accordingly to keep my income largely the same. People wonder which stocks to buy so we'll break down which type of stocks specifically within the market, are the best to building passive income regardless of which money app you use - Robinhood, WeBull, M1 Finance, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Vanguard, etc. Welcome to your financial investing guide 101 - investing for beginners and my reaction to the what the market has been doing.\n\nLegal Disclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor.

Just like the Roth IRA debate! Which investment is better? Real Estate? Or Reit Stocks? While the stock market is generally considered the best investment, the real answer is far more tricky. \n\nFirst, what is a Reit? A REIT is a stock, it stands for Real Estate Investment Trust. As a shareholder of a REIT, you get paid on a schedule in the form of passive income - dividends. REITs can be considered dividend stocks. Dividends are my personal favorite way of getting paid. Most of the stocks I own are in the Robinhood App.\n\nLet's settle this debate once and for all! \n\nLegal Disclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor.

Hailed as the #1 retirement investment account in the world, I want to explore what it is exactly, and why I don't personally have one. So - what is a roth ira?\n\nI share with you my robinhood app account and show you my dividend growth strategy for early retirement. Before discovering this strategy, I used vanguard's roth ira and I invested into index funds but I've always been fascinated on how not to pay taxes.\n\nSo a roth ira is a \"tax advantaged account\". Originally known as the ira plus, the maximum limit on contributions was just $2000 and limited to people with very low incomes. Nowadays, the roth ira has a maximum income cap limit. However,  a roth ira itself is NOT an investment.\n\nA roth ira is an account that contains the tax advantaged investments themselves. For example, you can put growth stocks, dividend stocks, mutual funds, bonds, CDs, and cash inside of this investment account. The idea is that you can pay taxes on  your income now, and withdraw your money post capital appreciation absolutely tax free.\n\nHowever, there are pros and cons to holding and investing within  a roth ira for someone in my position. Today I want to properly explain this retirement account and show you the advantages and the disadvantages of having a roth ira\n\nLegal Disclosure: I\u2019m not a financial advisor.

I want to show you my financial journey in real time by using the Robinhood investing app to build passive income and eventually - be rich. The strategy we're going to use to accomplish this is not very well known. It's called dividend growth investing combined with compound interest over time in the stock market ( using safe investments ). There are 3 simple steps we will take to recreate my multiple income streams. I truly believe this is one of the best ways to make money. The best part is that I did it with no college degree, as an immigrant, working only 5 years averaging roughly $40,000 a year - or just $20 an hour.

More specifically, comparing bonds to dividend stocks. Both are income producing assets, but how are they different? And should you own one of these, or both? There's a lot of questions to be answered! \n\nI'm primarily a dividend investor with my main taxable account in the Robinhood brokerage app. Ever since I was a beginning investor, I've always had a fascination with figuring out how to invest money the best way.\n\nTraditional advice says that everyone needs to own bonds.

I chose the Roth IRA because it\u2019s the most tax advantageous for my purposes.\n\nInitially, I was debating between going with M1 or Vanguard, but ultimately I picked M1 due to it's approach to investing basics, ease of use, flexibility, and low cost to start investing in the stock market.\n\nUsually I use Robinhood, however, Robinhood does not offer a retirement account. While I\u2019m also primarily a dividend investor that focuses on high quality dividend paying companies, I wanted to show beginners how to set up a Roth IRA with this incredibly easy to use finance app. \n\nNow I have the perfect trio, Robinhood, WeBull, and M1 Finance to complete the set of the best investing apps. The instructions in this video are simple and easy to follow along! \n\nIf you want to learn how to be rich slowly, this is it!\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

This Is the exact steps I followed between the ages of 19 to 28 to be able to achieve financial freedom. This is investing for beginners, a 101 guide on getting started with money management. \n\nThe first step is the essentials phase where the priority is paying for things that allow us to exist. First we start with rent and\/or the mortgage, followed by groceries. It\u2019s imperative to learn how to cook and aim for meals that cost anywhere between  $1-$2 to save as much of our incomes as possible. \n\nThen we pay for essential utilities such as water, electric, and gas\/heating along with essential hygiene items. The following step is paying for income earning expenses such as internet, phone, and anything that is required to help earn an income. \n\nHealth Care is the next one. In order to avoid paying the mandate, I used to donate to a church which exempted me from needing \u201creal\u201d  health insurance to avoid being penalized. The president has since done away with the mandate so you will not be penalized on the federal level, but each state has unique rules about this so double check with your state. At this point in time, consider making minimum payments on all debts and loans (student loans, credit cards, etc.)\n\nPhase 1 -  This is an optional step that will vary for everyone and it\u2019s not necessary but build an emergency fund of $1,000 or one months\u2019 worth of expenses. If you have liquid assets that can cover these expenses (such as my Robinhood Dividend Stock Portfolio), then this is not necessary. Pay any \u201cnon essential\u201d bills here as well (cable, internet, phone, etc.)\n\nPhase 2 - Contribute to your company\u2019s 401K and make sure to get  the full company match but do not exceed it at this point.\n\nPhase  3 - Make payments on mid to high interest rate debts of 10% or higher with either the \u201cavalanche\u201d or \u201csnowball\u201d methods, whichever one fits you best.\n\nPhase 4 - Invest and contribute to an IRA, your individual retirement account (I have a Roth IRA with the M1 Finance app). If you have any expenses to pay that  may increase your income such as certifications (for me it was my youtube equipment) , consider saving that money in a high yield savings account, if  you need it immediately,  use a checking account. \n\nPhase 5 - Aim to save at least 15% of your pre taxable income for retirement. This number is based on a research that showed people will need anywhere between 55% to 80% of their pre retirement income to support them in retirement. \n\nPlease reference the following guide for more details.

What does that mean? Minimalist Money is an approach on how to invest in a way that compliments the simple life. Minimalism is automation. \n\nToday I wanted to make a video that I could show my 20 year old self about investing. Using a free brokerage app like Robinhood, I wanted to show the 3 investments that one should own if they want to automate their personal finances to generate more passive income or want to grow their wealth with the stock market.\n\nI provide TWO approaches to growing your wealth.

Passive income is my favorite way of getting paid. Here are the top 7 ways I earn money online.\n\n#1 - Dividend Income investing from the stock market which happens to be my favorite way of receiving passive income. Dividend Passive Income requires a lot of money but it encourages you to save money, be frugal, and invest it rather than buying things you don't need.\n\n#2 - The second way I make money is through royalties. This is a lot more rare and most people don't make royalties but this can be a great source of passive income that I've been receiving since I was 19 years old through a course sale.\n\n#3 - Amazon Links is the third method. In fact, better than amazon links is the amazon bounty program which is a superior way to earn income on  Amazon.\n\n#4 - Shopify passive income is another great source where I earn income from selling my merchandise. This can be a great way to boost your passive income.\n\n#5 - Affiliate Marketing is a huge source of income for me by talking about the brokerages I use in my every day life to buy my stocks. By signing up to my link and funding your account, you will earn a stock valued at up to $1000 and  I will earn a small commission. It helps my channel out while giving you some stocks to get started with your investing.\n\n#6 - My Patreon page which is the one I'm thankful for the most. A lot of youtube creators will use Patreon to give early access to content. However, rather than stretching myself out too thin, I used that income to reinvest it and create tools for tracking our passive income from the same automated data provider that Robinhood and many other major brokerages use. This is an extremely expensive service and i'm using patron money to help fund it.\n\n#7 - YouTube passive income, the one you've been waiting for, my biggest source of passive income. The catch is, is that it's anything but passive. You have to work extremely hard, be consistent, honest, and helpful without  peddling your products and\/or constantly giving people a  timeshare presentation. \n\nHope you learned and got something out of this passive income video!\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

This is why it's so important to learn how to invest (even if you're a beginner to investing), so that you can build a passive income that isn't relying on government programs like social security (which may not be around forever).\n\nI started using the Robinhood app in late 2014, and in that short amount of time I was able to save over $100,000 in 5 years. I then used that money to build wealth by creating the most passive source of income known to the stock market - dividends. I used what I thought was the best brokerage - the Robinhood app to buy and sell stocks for free because it really does a good job catering investing for beginners.\n\nI was scared and terrified of losing money but I quickly learned as I went along. This video shows my 5 year progress of how I got here, and just how powerful reinvested dividends, and compound interest can be.\n\nIf you ever wanted to know how to make money while you sleep, this is it.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

What is the best investment, and where do you start? There's a lot of options to choose from. The ones we'll be covering in the video are stock market, dividends, real estate, bonds, cryptocurrency, and penny stocks. There are a LOT of other ways to invest but these are the major ways of investing that people seek in order to grow their passive income and wealth.\n\nNot all investments are created equal and each caters to a different person with different risk levels and money goals. Index funds typically tend to be riskier but have some of the best rates of return by following the broad stock market. Real Estate requires money and low interest rates but it can grow your net worth by leveraging. Real estate has created more millionaires than any other asset class.\n\nBonds are the least risky of all. They protect your wealth by giving you returns roughly equal to inflation at 2% per year. Young people in their 20s should not invest here. \n\nDividend investors have similar returns to index fund investors, except dividend investments are cash flow focused. I consider these to be the best investments that suits my needs the most. The downside is that you need a lot of cash to make passive income. Dividends are also taxed advantageously.\n\nIf you want to hedge your investments with an uncorrelated asset class, then cryptocurrency (gold of the digital age) is a good option to explore. The risk vs return is very favorable for investors and crypto enthusiasts who believe that fiat currency will go to zero.\n\nFor people who want to make money online, or make money fast, penny stocks are capable but they are extremely unreliable and take a lot of your time. Options are better than penny stocks but extremely difficult to be profitable with consistently. \n\nThese are the major forms of investing, and I'd like to cover more in the future.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

The Robinhood app announced two winning investment features that make it compete with the top brokerage of all time - Charles Schwab. The robinhood vs charles schwab battle continues.\n\nThere is arguably no better way to build wealth than investing in stocks. Prior to Robinhood launching with commission free trading, it was unheard of to pay zero commission for buying a stock. Nowadays, all other brokerages have decided to follow suit.\n\nJust yesterday,  Robinhood announced dividend reinvestment plans DRIP, and Fractional Share investing. These two new features will allow beginner investors to get started with less money. Robinhood now allows an investor to purchase 1\/1000000 of a stock with as little as $1.\n\nThe great news is that fractional share investments still entitle you to receive passive income in the form of dividends. However, your dividend will be based on the dividend yield in relation to the % of ownership in the stock. Robinhood automatically tracks your fractional share ownership.\n\nWho is DRIP investing for? It's for people who want to automate their investments, and be efficient by spending less time manually reinvesting their dividends.

When  it comes to personal finance, these are goals that are great to keep in mind when saving for retirement, budgeting, being debt free, saving money, paying off debt, investing, and beyond.\n\nWhen it comes to money, these are the essentials of financial minimalism and success. If you follow these money saving tips like I did, you'll be able to manage finances in a way that will build your wealth and net worth really fast. I was able to save $100,000 and when invested, that money has grown close to $200,000 in just 5 short years using the dividend investing strategy. Let's set some goals, and make it happen! Here are the top 12 goals to setting ourselves up to create more passive income and become financially free.\n\n1. Pay off at LEAST one credit card, more if you can. \n2. Start keeping track of your money and expenses. You can use an app like Personal Capital, or Mint, which tracks your expenses, budget,  income, and your credit score.\n3. Make a budget by limiting the amount you can spend per category, this way, you don't go over budget. There are two ways of accomplishing this described in the video.\n4. Try to go 100% cash for one month and see what happens. Cash is a finite resource, in contrast to credit cards which are harder to conceptualize a limit.\n5. Donate $100 to charity. It doesn't have to be money, it can be used clothing, or anything else that you no longer use.\n6. Start an IRA, this can be a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA. If you already have one, the goal will be to max it out. If you've done that too, convince one other friend to do the same\n7. Learn self control when shopping using the simple money trick shown in the video\n8. Set your bills on autopay\n9. Start a sidehustle or earn $1000 from your side business\n10. Learn to cook 3 frugal meals that cost between $1-$2 each\n11. Start investing in the stock market. Open up a brokerage account like Robinhood, WeBull, or M1 Finance, fund your account $100 and start as early as possible\n12. Save 50% of your income. You most likely have to earn between $40k-$50k salary to be able to do this, and live well below your means. It's possible, and that's exactly what I did.

It's not entirely passive because you need to consistently create content, but it's worth it if you can stick to it! \n\nHere is my YouTube income comparing two videos. One of my videos got over 15 million views, and the other one has almost 700,000 views. You would think the one with more views makes more money right? That's an incorrect assumption.

It's a commonly asked question. In today's video I want to explain a little bit about what goes into making a credit score, and how which one is ultimately better to use, cash or credit cards?\n\nMy parents discovered credit cards. Imagine coming from a country where the concept of credit cards, didn\u2019t exist, you could only buy, what you had in physical cash. If you didn\u2019t have it, you couldn\u2019t buy it. Then coming to the US and realizing, there\u2019s these little plastic cards that make you be able to buy anything through financing. \n\nSo if you\u2019re in credit card debt, student loan debt, or any other kind of debt, let\u2019s get some stats out of the way because I don\u2019t want you to feel bad. \n\nThe total consumer debt in the United States stands at nearly $14 trillion dollars. 1.5 trillion is coming from student loans, which is a household average of $46,822. Car loans, 1.3 trillion dollars or a household average of $27,804. Home loans\u2026.. 9.44 TRILLION dollars or $189,586. \n\nAnd credit cards\u2026.according to Experian which is one of the credit bureaus that make up your credit score (whenever people ask how to increase your credit score) they are 1 of 3. The average credit card debt is at $6,194. That\u2019s actually not bad, that\u2019s manageable, but it continues to climb at a rate of 3% per year. The average FICO credit score is 703 which is pretty good, and the driving force behind the increase are millennials. So if you fall anywhere in that debt range, just remember to breathe, it\u2019s going to be alright.\n\nBefore filming this video, I found an article by discover credit card, that said \u201cCash or Credit: Why Credit Cards win\u201d which I thought was hilarious , a credit card company claiming that credit cards are better than cash. \n\nDave Ramsey, a big finance guy in this space says burn all credit cards and get rid of them. Graham Stephan, another respected finance YouTuber says, use them. So which is it? To understand the answer to this question, let\u2019s cover some pros and cons that you may not have thought about before because they each have their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nPros of Credit Cards:\n\n-Here is the uncomfortable truth, no matter how much you may hate credit cards: here in the United States, it's tough to live without a credit card. You literally NEED a credit card to pay for things like hotels, and rental cars. Credit cards can be accepted everywhere but cash is not.\n\n- If your cash gets stolen, you\u2019re completely out of luck, there\u2019s no getting it back. With credit cards, if you lose it, all you have to do is call and cancel, some credit cards allow you to freeze the credit through the app directly without even needing to call.\n\n- Credit cards help build your credit history. This is something only installment loans, and credit cards can do. Unfortunately utility and phone bills generally do not build your credit like a lot of people think they do, but they can hurt your credit if you don\u2019t pay them on time.\n\n- Credit cards can also pay off your loans by consolidating your credit card debt into one interest free credit card, so if you have a ton of credit card debt, consider transferring it to a lower interest rate card so that it can buy you some time - usually limited time and IF you have a good credit score. \n\n- The BEST perk that credit cards provide over cash is the consumer protection and rewards like cash back.\n\n-The downside to credit cards is pretty obvious. the annual percentage rates on these \u201cunsecure loans\u201d, or APR as they call it, is a HUGE 16.97%. The stock market ON AVERAGE, returns about 10%. So if you\u2019re not paying your cards off every month, you\u2019re giving those companies MORE money than you would make if you had money invested in the stock market.\n\nPro of Cash:\n\n- Cash is a great tool for exercising self control, and budgeting in the most effective way possible. \n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I didn\u2019t understand dividends, and how to make money, but  I\u2019ve always wondered, why do stock prices go up and down? I thought it was because people are buying and selling stocks all the time right? So the price keeps changing and that makes sense, but who changes those prices? Is it people in the stock exchange, is it a committee of people like the stock brokers, or is it some automatic computer algorithm? And if it is automatic, how does it know what to change the stock price to? More importantly, who controls this program? These are very basic stock market investing questions that I\u2019ve had since forever and believe it or not, even some professional investors are not be able to answer these basic beginner investing questions\n\nBefore the age of computers, there was something called floor trading, which still goes on today - traders would come together in an exchange like the NYSE, New York Stock Exchange located in New York city at 11 Wall Street hence the term Wall Street. Here, they would trade stocks or securities with one another with a very interesting method called the open outcry.\n\nThey would essentially just shout at each other - for example, \u201c I want to buy 100 shares of Disney at $50\u201d and then someone would shout back \u201cSold 100 shares at $50\u201d, they would then write it down, everything was handwritten and kept track of manually. At the end of the day, they would settle all their transactions and that\u2019s how it worked for a long time. If you were a retail investor, you would call up your broker, and make your stock order with him or her and they would try to match you with someone on the floor who was either buying or selling what you had to offer. \n\nNowadays, everything is digital and free with apps like WeBull, M1 Finance, and Robinhood. So what determines the price of a stock then now that it\u2019s all digital? Not the value of the shares which stems from fundamentals like earnings reports, dividends, and other financial factors - rather, the actual price itself that you see on a stock exchange, why it moves, and who\u2019s controlling it? \n\nThe \u201cprice\u201d is actually nothing more than the last price that the stock or security was traded at. There is no formula or math equation that looks at a company\u2019s intrinsic value. At any moment, the price ONLY represents what people are willing to pay for a stock. So the price you see in the brokerages that keeps on being updated every second is what the last price of the stock that was just bought at or sold. \n\nThere are many factors that could influence a change in the stock\u2019s price but the main reason we can say it changes is due to market supply and demand. For example, if the stock price starts to increase, that means a lot of people want to buy the stock - that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to Tesla right now. A stock price will fall, when everyone is trying to sell it because then, you\u2019ll have less buyers, and when there\u2019s no no around to buy it, people are going to be willing to sell it for a lot less until It meets the demand.\n\nEach exchange does this process behind the scenes, and you don\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s important to understand how it works so you don\u2019t end up buying stocks that are over priced. This is all automatic and it happens invisibly that through a digital database that contains the \u201celectronic limit order book\u201d or ELOB.\n\n Imagine a column of buy offers on one side, and a column of sell offers on the other. On the buy offer side, the offers are organized from largest dollar value, to smallest dollar value. The sell side is the reverse, it starts with the smallest dollar value, and goes down to the highest dollar value. This is what\u2019s known as the \u201cbid\u201d and the \u201cask\u201d.  Buy is bid, ask is sell. \n\nThat\u2019s where limit and market orders come into play, and that\u2019s what is discussed in the video.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

In order to generate passive income, we have to save money so that we can become millionaires.\n\nLast year In 2019 GoBankingRates polled Americans to find out how much they ave in their savings account, and the results are getting worse and worse. 69% of people polled said they have less than $1,000 in savings which means they live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nHow can that be when the economy is booming and the stock market, the real estate market are all growing insanely high right now? According to this same survey when asked what the REASON was that people cited not being able to save is because the cost of living is keeping Americans down. Being a financial minimalist myself, I know life CAN be expensive, but it doesn\u2019t HAVE to be expensive, and ultimately, I think that\u2019s one big excuse that we tell ourselves. The REAL reason, is our inability to delay gratification.\n\nI believe the true reason for our decline in savings is because we live in an on demand economy. Buying products and signing up to subscriptions is becoming as easy as a swipe of your finger and it\u2019s done. The easier it is to make bad decisions, the more we\u2019re going to make them. However, ultimately, the decision to be careless with money comes down to us. It\u2019s a choice we all have to make, drive a Tesla but work until you\u2019re old, or ride a bicycle and retire when you\u2019re young. \n\nWhen it comes to saving money fast, it's more important to focus on the wins by increasing your income. Once you're able to make $40k-$50k per year annual salary, then we can focus on saving. It makes no sense to save money on coffee if you're not making much money. \n\nI like to think of it in 3 general broad categories that we have to budget for. Food, travel, and housing. \n\nWhen it comes to food, we're very frugal and focus on cooking at home and making cheap meals. This saves us a ton of money.\n\nWhen it comes to travel, Corrie and I drive a very cheap car that we just recently sold for $600. In order to really save a lot of money, I don't own a car at all and instead I will bicycle wherever I I need to go.\n\nFor housing, we keep our costs low by house hacking as renters. We can save a ton of money by renting different parts of the house to each other. This is the single biggest expense you have to manage if you want to start building wealth and saving money fast. \n\nOverall, focus on the big wins and you'll be amazed at how quickly you can save six figures and start investing it. I did it in just 4 short years, and Corrie has managed to save $25,000 in just one year. Anything is possible as long as you start and conquer your need to spend money on material things.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

The stock market is at it\u2019s all time high. CNBC just published an article on their theory of what is pushing stocks so high, and it turns out it\u2019s not institutional investors like mutual funds and index funds. Instead, it\u2019s hedge funds playing catch up to this bull market. That's not a confidence inspiring sign.\n\nI've been a dividend investor since 2014, saving my money, investing (using brokerages like Robinhood, WeBull, M1 Finance, and Vanguard). Over the last 5 years, with some luck, minimalism, and money management skills, I've managed to save and invest over six figures and $7,000 of passive income. \n\nA lot of beginner investors ask me if they should wait for the stock market crash \/ economic recession, or start investing and buying stocks today. What is the right answer?\n\nIn order to understand the answer to that question, we have to understand why everyone is afraid of a financial meltdown in the first place. \n\nIndicator #1 something called the inverse yield curve. What it means is when long term investments yield lower interest rates than short term investments. There is an increased risk in investments that are longer term, which doesn\u2019t make any sense. If you\u2019re going to invest and lock your money away for many years at a time, you want it to have a higher yield than a lower one.\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about the inverted yield curve, it looks at bonds to see their yields or \u201cinterest rates\u201d, and if short term bonds provide higher interest rates than long term bonds, then we get the inverse yield curve.  When this happens, it is often times seen as an indicator for an upcoming recession and investors believe that interest rates will fall.\n\nHistorically, we have seen this in the past and it\u2019s been a reliable indicator of showing us the last 7 recessions successfully. This happened in the 80s, during the Dotcom bubble bust around 2000, and it preceded the 2008 recession as well.\n\nIndicator #2 - The ISM Index. This is a big one, this is is called the Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index. This index looks at the economy\u2019s manufacturing sector month to month. Specifically it looks at orders, employment rates, production, supply chains, and inventories in the manufacturing space which is a big sign of the health of the economy.\n\nA PMI Index of more than 50 means that this important part of the economy is expanding and growing. A score of 50 means no change from last month, and below 50 means the economy is contracting and slowing down. As of right now, the PMI Index is 52.4, with forecasts for that number to be increasing. This means investors can probably expect to be bullish on the stock market in reaction to the higher profits when this index is above 50.\n\nIndicator #3 - Warren Buffet indicator. You may have read somewhere that Warren Buffet has an excessively large cash position of close to $130 billion dollars. Does this mean Warren Buffet is preparing for the worst economic crash in US history? I don't believe so, and the video addresses why that is.\n\nIndicator #4 Ray Dahlio. A very smart billionaire made an insurance bet of 1% of his hedge fund - the equivalent of 1.5 billion dollars indicating the market will move lower. \n\nWith all these indicators, what is going to happen to the economy and what is your plan?\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

What it is - is its a savings account, pure and simple. Think of your checking and savings but it\u2019s a separate account that gives you multiple tax advantages. Anyone can have an HSA who's enrolle in a high deductible health plan which is often abbreviated as - HDHP.\n\nA deductible is what YOU have to pay FIRST before your insurance kicks in. For example, if you have $2,000 deductible healthcare plan, that means if you get into an accident and break your finger off, that means YOU have to cover up to $2,000 of it FIRST, before your insurance will pay for the rest of it. That\u2019s what a deductible is. A premium on the other hand, is what you pay for your health insurance, usually on a monthly basis.\n\nMoney that goes into your HSA is yours FOREVER, and you use that money to pay for medical expenses without paying taxes on it. If you change jobs, or get fired from a job, you still get to keep your HSA BUT you can only contribute to it IF you're enrolled in a qualifying HDHP.\n\n if you lose your job halfway through the year, you can still contribute up to a certain percent of however long you worked for. So for example, if you worked for 6 months of the year, you can contribute up to half the limit which is $3,550 for individual plans, and 7100 for family plans in 2020. Also, you do NOT have to contribute a portion of your pay check each time, you can literally contribute NOTHING the entire year and then  do one giant lump sum at the end of the year and max it out like I did with my Roth IRA when I set mine up when I made the tutorial with the M1 Finance app.\n\nThe HSA account is a way for the government to provide help for people with higher out of pocket costs by motivating people to hopefully save and invest their money so that they can pay for said costs. If you can take advantage of an HSA, it would be a very smart move for your money but in order to understand just WHY this is considered a super IRA, you have to understand the benefits of a few other accounts, specifically, your Traditional IRA, and your Roth IRA. The HSA account is like a hybrid of both of those accounts.\n\nMost people however dismiss this account because of ONE simple rule. The health savings account can ONLY be used to pay for medical expenses. if you don\u2019t use end up using your HSA for any medical expenses, you can actually use that money for ANY expenses after you turn 65 without a penalty. You\u2019ll still have to pay income tax on money that you withdraw that are not qualified medical expenses, just like you would in a traditional IRA, but you won\u2019t have any more penalties or fees. So worst case scenario, this HSA account literally becomes like your traditional IRA.\n\nLeave this money alone, and let it sit invested in a low cost index fund that\u2019s tracking the market IF your employer offers it. So instead of paying your medical bills and then reimbursing yourself with your HSA, pay for your medical bills with your normal tax money that you earn, and just leave your HSA account alone and let compound interest do the magic of multiplying your money.\n\nBUT MAKE SURE, to keep track and hold on to ALL receipts of your medical expenses so you know how much you can withdraw from your HSA. As you start to pay those bills, you can increase the amount you can withdraw in early retirement. You\u2019re basically concerting your HSA into an early retirement Roth IRA over time.\n\nAfter age 65,  any money that\u2019s left that wasn\u2019t used to pay for medical expenses you basically treat as a traditional IRA with any additional withdrawals to be taxed as ordinary income.fter age 65,  any money that\u2019s left that wasn\u2019t used to pay for medical expenses you basically treat as a traditional IRA with any additional withdrawals to be taxed as ordinary income.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

That\u2019s one of the most common questions I get. How do you know?\n\nSelling can always be a stressful thing to do because ideally, if we did a good job buying a stock, the best time to sell - should be never. If you are going to be selling some of your stock whether that's for some passive income, or if you'd like to save money to perhaps invest somewhere else, here are 5 great rules to stick to.\n\nFor reference, I'm using the Robinhood app, and I'm a dividend investor but this should apply no matter which type of investor you are. Please Note: this video is for entertainment purposes only and I will not be held responsible for any incurred losses.\n\nSell Rule #1, you might want to sell when the company long term \u201cprofitability\u201d is not looking too good. They did a study analyzing stock returns between 1990 and 2010, and stocks with the highest trend in earnings growth, returned 11.5% per year, which is a LOT if you\u2019re not sure - while the stocks with the lowest earnings growth, returned only 1.5% per year - which is pretty much less than inflation. Just for comparison, the top 500 companies in the US returned an average of 6.3% per year. So basically what that means is, companies that can grow their earnings over time will see the stock price obviously move higher. \n\nSell Rule #2  - selling when a stock has gotten excessively expensive. One good example right now is Tesla. The hype is at it\u2019s peak, everyone screaming about Tesla and it\u2019s worth more than GM and FORD combined. When that happens, it\u2019s a good time to consider pulling back on the company and waiting until a more reasonable valuation and the price of the stock drops. \n\nSell Rule #3 - If the size of your position becomes overly large - you may consider selling. If you\u2019re a dividend investor like me, you might notice one of your companies is responsible for a REALLY big portion of your income, and you don\u2019t want to be in that situation. Because if the dividend gets cut, you lose a big part of that income, so you want keep them in moderation so they don\u2019t represent an overly large percentage.\n\nAnother way to look at it is if the value of the stock itself has increased to more than 5% of your entire portfolio. Anything above 5% of your entire investment portfolio should be taken a look at and maybe leveled off and brought down below 5% because anything more than that - can become risky. 5% is not the definitive rule, it\u2019s just what I\u2019ve been comfortable with\n\nSell Rule #4 - sell when you have a better investment idea. This could be anything, it doesn\u2019t even have to be another stock. It could be real estate, a bond, or your education. In the case of my stock portfolio, there are definitely companies in that are losing money that could be put to better use elsewhere in a company that\u2019s perhaps more healthy, pays a safer dividend,  or has a higher earnings growth. Fortunately for me, there are enough winning companies that offset any losses from my other investments that more than make up for it all. \n\nSell Rule #5 is probably the best and easiest way for us as dividend investors to keep track on when to sell a company. Obviously, the goal is to have our dividend income fund our lifestyle from all the passive income we collect, however - If a stock becomes dangerously close to cutting it\u2019s dividend, it\u2019s usually time to sell.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

What is the exact net worth?\n\nIn order to have a real understanding of how much your true net worth is, you need to look at the bigger picture. Using globalrichlist.com , plug in your area and income. In the case of the average American worker, based on $50,000 per year annual salary, most Americans are in the top 0.31% of the world. Forget about being in the top 1%, they are nearly all in the decimal category.\n\nJust for comparison sake, It would take an average labor worker in Ghana exactly 312 years to earn what most Americans will earn in just ONE year. 312 years. If you wanted a can of soda, it would take yu roughly 1 minute to earn it, and it takes them an HOUR of work. $50,000 per year would also pay the monthly salaries of 307 doctors in Malawi. \n\nImagine how the world feels when Americans complain about not making enough money on six figures per year? The consumer mentality needs to change.\n\nMy definition of how much money you need to be considered rich has evolved throughout the years. At first I thought it was wearing designer clothing, then I thought it was luxury watches, then cars, and ultimately I thought I could call myself rich when I started living in a million dollar condo in Las Vegas. All of these definitions are wrong.\n\nAccording to CNBC and mainstream media, to be considered \u201crich,\u201d in the US, you need a net worth of at least $2.3 million. Of course, that study ONLY shows what people THINK they need, and most people simply have no clue. So what it does it mean to be considered rich exactly?\n\nHere is the answer: you are rich when you no longer have to actively work for your money. You can actually figure out your \u201crich\u201d number very easily. Download an app like Mint or Personal Capital, or just start tracking what you spend on average per year. Just take what you spent last month (on everything, house, food, car, etc) , multiply it by 12 and we\u2019ll call that your average annual expense. Then you take THAT number and multiply IT by 25. Make sure you\u2019re using your expenses number, not your income number. This is called the \"cross over point\" or the rule of 25, it's when your passive income is the same or greater than your debts and expenses.\n\nMy expenses are roughly $2,000 per month or $24,000 per year. Multiplying $24,000 times by 25 I get $600,000. I need $600,000 invested at 4%, to never have to work for money for the rest of my life because 4% of $600,000 is $24,000. This is called the rule of 25. That is the true definition of \u201crich\u201d. \n\nThe cool thing with my plan about how I\u2019m getting there with dividends. You can comfortably live on something like $24,000 per year especially if it\u2019s through dividends and dividend growth investing because you would earn nearly ALL of that money tax free through qualified dividends if your income falls below $38,600.\n\n Politicians, authors, reporters, nurses, teachers, engineers, also have no clue.  They\u2019re not bad at earning money, they\u2019re just bad at understanding how to manage it. Your earning power has nothing to do with being rich, your stuff has nothing to do with it, your job title has nothing to do with it, AND - debt has nothing to do with it. \n\nMake sure to get your stocks from Robinhood and WeBull if you haven\u2019t already.

These are the S.M.A.R.T. goals that will help you achieve incredible success in the year 2020 and beyond. Whether you want to retire early, want to build dividends, passive income, have short term money goals, this is a great guide to follow.\n\nStarting with the first way of winning big and setting goals that will put you on the path of success of S.M.A.R.T. (Smart Goals) is\n\nS - It has to be something that is specific. Saying \"I want more money\" isn't specific enough. Be specific with your goals and understand the difference between goals and dreams\/visions. Dreams are not something you accomplish in the short term, while goals have a specific strategy.\n\nM stands for measurable. Your has to be something you can measure. Saying \"I want to be happier\" is not specific nor measurable so it will difficult to keep track of progress. Make sure your goal is measurable.\n\nA stands for Attainable. Your goals have to be something within your reach and capabilities of accomplishing. Make sure it\u2019s something that\u2019s within your reach. 10 years ago at 20 years old, I never imagined, I would ever have $10,000, let alone, save $100,000 by age 25, but they were attainable goals. If I hadn\u2019t committed to saving 50% of my income when I was making roughly $25 an hour, I wouldn\u2019t be here today. \n\nR stands relevant. If you\u2019re trying to build a brand then pick an industry that\u2019s relevant - some industries today are more relevant than others. Some industries, like in my case - personal finance, is cyclical, kind of like the economy - it experiences different cycles. If you\u2019re into building a brand about blockchain, that may have a small window of time to boost you like crazy, so consider what\u2019s relevant and what will benefit you in some way obviously and that your circumstances allow you to achieve it in a relevant way with resources you actually have. \n\nT stands for Time-bound or Timely. Your smart goals have to have a deadline. One of the most important things I learned in life is that if you don\u2019t have a specific deadline, things just don\u2019t happen. This is just as true for business finance related goals as it is for personal relationships.\n\nLasty, you need to figure out your \"why\". Why are you saving money and investing in WeBull and Robinhood? What's the end goal of all that saving and investing in the stock market? The better your why is, the more likely you will remain consistent and keep pushing forward whehn you're not seeing results at first.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Who wouldn't want to retire early ? How early? Some people can retire by their mid 20s, some at 30s, and my plan is to invest my money until I'm 40. I'm using the Robinhood app as my brokerage of choice, but this can be done with any brokerage. My investing plan is to use dividend to generate enough passive income to pay for my bills.\n\nIn this video, I want to show you my progress with dividend investing in the last 5 years. Specifically, I want to show you my dividend income for January of 2020 and compare that to my income in January of 2019. \n\nIn order to achieve F.I.R.E. or Financial Independence Retired Early, we have to stay consistent. I've scheduled an automatic deposit with the Robinhood app to transfer $2000 to my account on the first of every month. This way, I can stay consistent. I encourage everyone who wants to learn how to invest to be consistent, even if you don't have much money to start with. \n\nIn order to be successful in the stock market, you just have to mentally prepare yourself. There are many ways to put your money to work for you, but the best way to invest that I've found that works with my mental health, is dividend investing. You won't see the same returns and gains as real estate investing because your money isn't leveraged, but you will see a steady stream of passive income that will continue to grow and hopefully get you to retire early, before you turn 40.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

If proven to be true, the case for Tesla going to several thousand dollars per share could be very real.\n\nSince we have fractional shares from brokerages like Robinhood, we can invest in smaller positions and have our money grow tremendously over the next 10 years. Some predict that Tesla's Market Cap will reach over a trillion dollars in just ten years time. That means your money could 6x-10x from this point in just ten short years. Historically, the stock market only doubles your money roughly every ten years, so this is a very exciting investment.\n\nIf you ever wondered how to invest, how to make money in your 20s, Tesla could be a very good long term play for your money\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Today I'd like to show him how to make passive income by investing in either index funds, or dividends using exchange traded funds or \"ETFs\". \n\nHere are some topics we'll be covering with the robinhood app. Signing up, basic features I use, setting up auto transfer from your bank, which features to avoid (such as leveraged trading, robinhood gold, margin trading, etc.), how to buy and sell, and finally, I'm going to set my friend up with a stock based on his investing goals. \n\nBased on Nick\u2019s answers, I went with either a broad market S&P500  ETF, or a dividend etf. When I say broad market, I\u2019m referring to the S&P500 which tracks the biggest 500 companies in the United States. An index fund, tracks the performance of all these companies in what are called mutual funds.  An ETF is an exchange traded fund version of that which is a fancy way of saying, it\u2019s a stock that is regularly traded on an app like Robinhood, which I consider to be the best brokerage app.\n\nPersonally, I own close to 100 stocks, but it takes a lot of time to manage them, an ETF is essentially a compressed version of them all in one stock, for a price that\u2019s just a fraction of my portfolio - by spreading your money across all the different equities. An ETF is a great way to automate investing, saving you time, while beating most people\u2019s market returns.\n\nAnother advantage of ETFs is the self shedding and self growing process. Meaning, if one of the stocks falls out of it's respective criteria, it will be replaced by anther stock, without your input and management. You have zero work with ETFs.\n\nThere are many ETFs to select from, VIG, SPHD, SCHD, SPYD, SDY, the list goes on and on and it really does get overwhelming, but there\u2019s not that much of a difference between them other than what they track and what are called \"expense ratios\" which is we as investors pay yearly for this automation.\n\nOne of my favorite dividend etfs is SPHD with a dividend yield of 4.3%. That means for every $100, you will be earning $4.30 per year. This is paid out monthly (spread out over the course of 12 months).\n\nAlternatively, another good stock is VTSAX, it\u2019s the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. It tracks the entire stock market of the US, it contains over 3,600 companies. If you were to get the index fund version of this fund, you would need a minimum of $3,000, but because this is the exchange traded fund version of this stock, it's much cheaper.\n\nBy buying either of these consistently, you can create an incredible stream of passive income that will pay you dividends for a very long time in retirement. \n\nSpeaking of early retirement, when you're ready to sell, you don\u2019t sell all your stocks at once. You only sell what you need to pay for life\u2019s expenses. The better way, is to withdraw 4% per year. The theory is that you will never run out of money because your invested money will make money faster than you can spend it.\n\nIs Robinhood safe though? What if Robinhood goes out of business? Fortunately, Robinhood is SIPC insured. Even if a brokerage like this goes out of business, your cash and stocks will be protected up to $500,000, cash is protected up to $250,000 of that half a million. That\u2019s called SIPC insurance, and you don\u2019t ever want to use a brokerage that isn\u2019t SIPC insured, nor use banks that are NOT FDIC insured.\n\nPlease remember when investing, to always do your own research, the opinions expressed in this video are solely my own.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I've made many mistakes with regards to my finances and money long before I understood how to invest my money properly. This is also long before I discovered dividends and how to navigate the stock market. \n\n85% of Americans admit to making some sort of mistake with their personal finances. I am a part of that statistic, and here are my top 7 money mistakes.\n\n#1 - going to college: I was on a scholarship, and almost half of my college tuition was paid for. However, I still feel like it was a mistake for me to go and waste an entire year of my life and over ten thousand dollars paying for classes and books that are literally still collecting dust in my garage. \n\nBesides losing $10,000 which could be now be worth over $21,000 more in my account if invested, what I lost the most from the experience, is the opportunity cost of time. It was an expensive mistake for sure\n\n#2 - Not getting a credit card until I was age 25. Thanks to my parents, whom I absolutely love, I was scared off of using credit cards. They had absolutely no idea what it meant to wield the power of a credit card. That led toward the inevitable spiral that is credit card debt, a ruined credit score and history and with that, a lot more trouble when we needed really important things like financing on a car, financing on a house, and even renting a simple apartment. \n\nSo naturally, I was terrified of using credit cards and I avoided them at all costs. I had no idea that if used responsibly, and that\u2019s as easy as not spending beyond your means, keeping the utilization rate low, paying on time by setting it to autopay and paying off the whole balance every on time, you could earn things like cash back, points to be used toward travel and free stuff, consumer protections, roadside assistance, etc. Credit cards can be your best friend in a time of need.\n\n#3 - Buying Useless Luxuries. I bought an overpriced platform bed that cost me $2,500 which could have been invested in the stock market and returned over double that by now. Huge mistake\n\nMy second reckless purchase was a luxury car that in total cost over $21,000. Similar story, trying to impress my neighbors. If invested in the S&P500, I would have had an extra $45,000 in my robinhood app. Expensive lesson learned! \n\n#4 - Called my girlfriend to find out her biggest financial mistakes.\n\n#5 - Never letting my significant other pay for me which was a huge mistake. In order to have an equal and healthy relationship, both people need to feel invested not only emotionally, but financially as well. \n\n#6 - being too complacent at my career where I was earning $50k per year. Because I was working for my heroes that I grew up watching, I never challenged them and that limited my intellectual and financial growth. I'm upset at myself for this mistake the most, because it cost me many years of opportunities and sacrificed relationships. Stay loyal to yourself, never to the business that employs you.\n\n#7 - Trying to get rich quick. I'm sure we've all been there, desperately looking up phrases like how to work from home, how to make money quick, how to make money online, how to invest, etc. This led me down a path of investing in penny stocks, buying stock picking newsletters, over priced courses, listening to guru advice, etc. In the end, it cost me time and money. Another mistake learned. You will never build wealth and passive income by buying a secret. There is no such thing and you will never get something from nothing.\n\nThese are my biggest money mistakes that I've made in my 20s, I'd love to hear yours!\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

When I say millionaire, I don\u2019t mean have a million dollars cash in the bank account.  I mean a net worth of a million dollars, across all my assets like stocks, real estate, cash, etc. Everything. Speaking of cash - what does a million dollars even look like? \n\nHave you ever seen a million dollars? What does it feel like? Today, I found exactly what a million dollars looks like. \n\nDave Ramsey\u2019s advice to becoming a millionaire is one of his most popular videos which got several million views and it\u2019s a pretty simple strategy. The way to become a millionaire is to invest exactly $100 every single month in a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA or a Traditional IRA, by buying a stock that\u2019s growing at 12% per year - and if you can do that for 40 straight years, then you can become a millionaire if you can invest 100 a month with said 12% stock. Sounds easy.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s a highly debated and disputed point amongst the finance community whether or not such a 12% stock even exists because keep in mind, the average historical stock market return rate is around 10%, or 6 to 8% real return after inflation. In fact, John Bogle, the legendary investor who created index funds and Vanguard, has even made a compelling case that the next ten years will return only \u2026..4% per year.  So 12% returns for 40 straight years is really optimistic. \n\nThe stock in question was American Funds Investment Company of America, mutual fund ticker AIVSX which was started in 1934. It has averaged roughly 12% since it was FIRST created. \n\nAnother one is the Pioneer Fund , ticker symbol PIODX which averaged 11.88% since 1928. So he\u2019s not wrong that if you can save $100 and invest it at 12% in a Roth IRA account, letting it grow tax free, you\u2019ll be a millionaire by age 60, if you started by age 20. \n\nIf you\u2019re using the Robinhood app like I am, a really good alternative to the AIVSX is VOO which is a large cap ETF with a much smaller expense ratio of .03% than AIVSX\u2019s HUGE .5% and has outperformed it in the last 10 years. If you look for VOO in Robinhood you will find it. This is not financial advice because I\u2019m still, not a licensed professional.  \n\nNow here\u2019s where I\u2019m taking a complete opposite approach to becoming a millionaire . My investing philosophy differs from Dave Ramsey\u2019s. I\u2019m not saying my investing approach is better, but unlike Dave Ramsey\u2019s approach which says you\u2019re going to be working for 40 years until you\u2019re a millionaire and ready to go out and live your life without needing a job, I prefer to work for a shorter period of time and retire much earlier in life by taking a slightly higher risk. Of course when I say retire I mean when your passive income meets and\/or exceeds what you pay for your bills. Because at that point, you don\u2019t need an active job if your passive income can pay for your lifestyle. \n\nTbere are lots of different ways to do this like with real estate for example, and there are a ton of YouTube channels that are dedicated to specifically that with real estate, like Graham Stephan, MeetKevin, and others, but those are the only two real estate focused channels I watch. I personally prefer what are called income producing dividend stocks. These stocks allow me to collect passive income no matter where I am in the world, no matter what I\u2019m doing. In addition to that, I want to maximize my time here on YouTube to finally reach millionaire status in 1 year.\n\nThis is my million dollar plan. The plan to have a net worth of 1 million dollars by the end of 2021.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Instead, it's about finding a career that will make you the most money, that you can get the quickest, that you can live with the most.\n\nPhase 2 - The next phase of your life - is between ages 18 to 24, you are most likely in college now. Set yourself up to become a millionaire in retirement by creating an IRA account, Roth IRA or Traditional IRA. Second thing you NEED to to do is AVOID DEBT. \n\nSide: Phase 3 between ages of 25-30 is most likely when you get your FIRST career job. Hopefully it\u2019s something that pays you at MINIMUM, 40 - 50k per year. Make sure to start strong. This is one of the most important times to be negotiation with the person hiring you. If you start too low, it will take you YAERS just to catch up to someone who spent an hour asking for more. This is what happened to me. \n\nPhase 4 is between ages 31 - to 54. This phase, is probably the most important phase. It\u2019s important because this is where you can make up for all the lost time and all the poor decisions you might have made in life. And the way we do that is 2 WAYS. You use either one or BOTH for more effect. Negotiating, and job hopping to make more money.\n\nMy favorite way to make more money out of these two methods is job hopping which is where you switch jobs or positions every few years. That's the best way how to make a higher income\n\nWhile you\u2019re earning this money, guess what you need to do? Be living below your means, saving your money and investing the difference. I do dividend investing and I create passive income though bluechip dividend stocks with my portfolio, which has taken a beating lately, and I love it, because I get t buy MORE stocks at cheaper prices that pay me even MORE money. \n\nIf you can make your decisions based on this thought process, you can fast track yourself to make more money and be \u201crich\u201d by the time you\u2019re in your mid 20s or early 30s. That\u2019s not a joke. In fact there\u2019s a group of people that have done just that, the FIRE community. By taking all of this advice into consideration, there are now people that are 25 years old that no longer have a job because they lived below their means, they invested their savings and thy live passively off their investments\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Also The fed has cut rates once again to prop up the economy due to what\u2019s going on globally with the illness, AND, as a result of the fed cutting rates, Robinhood cuts their APY to down to half percent on all uninvested cash effective March third.. \n\nSo what does this all mean for you and I, our money, my investment portfolio, will I be switching? What does the Fed rate cut mean for all of us? \n\nThe rumors suggest that it was thought to be due to a coding error because of a leap year, while others believed they were just outright hacked. Neither actually ended up being true. According to the coCEOs of Robinhood, and I quote \u201cthe cause of the outage was stress on our infrastructure \u2014 which\u00a0struggled with unprecedented load. That in turn led to\u00a0a\u00a0\u201cthundering herd\u201d effect \u2014 triggering a failure of our DNS system.\u201d\n\nRobinhood DID eventually send out an email acknowledging they were experiencing issues. Which in my opinion was was too little too late, because they should have sent that email out at the start of the day when the issue was happening, not at the end of the day because by then people were furious and rightfully so. \n\nBut it gets worse, Tuesday morning, their service went down AGAIN. -_- They eventually restored their app 2 hours later by 12pm, but those two crucial hours cost people MORE money which brings us to another important point.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Robinhood is going to compensate people for this issue and get people their money back, here is how. \n\nTo all people subscribed to their GOLD service, their premium subscription service that lets you borrow money to trade, gives you access to MorningStar research, NASDAQ data, and larger instant saw deposits. You will be given 3 months of subscription to this service for FREE. Which sounds REALLY nice, until you realize that it\u2019s only for those who already had the service - which I don\u2019t. Their email says nothing for people who are not subscribed to that service.\n\nIf you were personally affected by this outage, please go to Robinhood.com\/contact, login, and you will be asked a series of questions regarding what happened. And according to Robinhood, they will be handling each person on a case by case basis.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

You could BARELY use Robinhood at all. This was worsened by a perfect storm, because that Monday March 2nd was also the biggest day of economic recovery since the last stock market crash - when it gained 4.6%. That means a lot of people lost money, not only because they were not able to buy stocks, but especially people the options traders who bet the market would go down, and when it didn\u2019t, they weren\u2019t able to sell their stocks, and lost money all their money. \n\nAnd if things could not get worse, they are also being looked at by the SEC - which is one of the scariest things that can happen to a company. It\u2019s like the equivalent of the IRS calling you and asking you about those taxes you forgot to pay 3 years ago. And because the SEC is closely looking at Robinhood now, there\u2019s a CHANCE that they could find something sketchy and dubious and take them off the App Store for good. Those are all possible outcomes and in order to continue TRUSTING an app with a lot of our money, I think now is the perfect time to ask ourselves the BIG question\u2026is Robinhood SAFE to use anymore? What happens to our money exactly if the worst was to happen, just like it did to some people who opened Robinhood on Monday of last week, and saw their account balance was LITERALLY - $0.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Would you panic at this point? Would you sell your stocks? \n\nIn TODAY\u2019s video I want to talk about what I\u2019m doing as a dividend investor because the Fed is about to inject 1.5 TRILLION DOLLARS into the economy to save the market from completely disappearing, I\u2019ll show you what my portfolio is doing specifically, as a breakdown along with my income to see how I\u2019ve been affected during this stock market crash and by sharing my story, I hope I can give you some insight, some confidence to keep going, and to keep investing.\n\nI like to make these dividend investment portfolio video updates once a month, like I\u2019ve been doing since January of 2019 to see my own journey as a way for me to keep track how I\u2019m progressing, through both good times, bad times like we\u2019re in now.\n\nNo matter what\u2019s going on in the market, I like to make money, that makes the most sense to me. If I did it any other way, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d have the courage to hold all my stocks because the last month, literally rewinded the clock on almost 4 years of investing progress. In one month, 4 years vanished in the blink of an eye. This is very much so why I\u2019m a dividend investor in these times - my money keeps paying me money. Every single month that I\u2019ve been an investor, I still make several hundred dollars, and sometimes as much as a thousand dollars to do nothing, and just passively sleep.\n\nNow is the perfect time to start investing as a dividend growth investor or really any other kind of investor. RIGHT NOW, you have been given a time machine, to go back, and make right all those times you wanted to start investing but didn\u2019t because you heard the market was too high. If we reference stock prices, you can see when prices were at all time highs - that's when people really want to start investing, when they see everyone else around them making money. You get the fear of missing out - fomo. But now more than ever as stock prices fall, is the time to get serious.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe the amount of people that say \u201cthis time is different\u201d. I get those comments all the time.  \"The stock market is about to do something the likes of which you have never seen before!\" Insert vague prediction with no deadline along with a few technical words. When you hear that stuff, it creates a perpetual myth of fear and uncertainty which is exactly what makes the situation worse. \n\nBut ask yourself this\u2026.\u201d Has this stock market crash, really changed the way business will continue to make money in America, or anywhere else in the world?\" I don't believe so, and in this video I explain exactly why and how I want to continue investing through these tough times ahead.\n\nAs always, pay down your credit card debts, loans, save your money, live frugally, become a financial minimalist and start investing to finally build your wealth and perhaps, become a millionaire\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

If you were laid off the first thing you need to do is set up your unemployment benefits.\n\nOnce you've set up some passive income if you don't have a job, here are 5 things to avoid doing with your money and investing right now.\n\n#1 Do not move your money from your bank account into a mattress. Don\u2019t cash out your money and put it somewhere, it\u2019s not going to help. In fact, it\u2019s going to put your money in a more risky situation if something happens to your house. Your bank should be FDIC insured which means even if it goes under, which most likely it will not, your money will still be insured up to the legal limit of $250,000 and you\u2019ll be fine.\n\n#2 Do not sell your investments and do not touch your retirement accounts. At the end of the day, the stock market can recover just as quickly as it fell and no one knows or can predict the stock market bottom when investing. \n\n#3 if you need money for the next 3 to 6 months like my parents, do NOT INVEST, pause contributing to any retirement accounts, unless you have enough to cover for your expenses because it\u2019s likely the market will continue to fall as the layoffs get worse. Be careful contributing to your retirement account (beyond employer contribution matching) only to realize that money could have been useful to pay your bills because you just got laid off. It may not make sense to withdraw your money because it lost a significant portion of it\u2019s value so hope for the best, plan for the worst.\n\n#4 Avoid scams. There is an influx of people posing as the CDC, the IRS, or people promising to have new investment opportunities ajljljnd while you're staying home, you will receive suspicious looking emails asking you for money, your login details, and you want to use caution and be extremely careful.\n\nHere is what you do want do with your money:\n\n#1 Build an emergency fund. Hopefully after watching my channel you already have one but if not, NOW is the time to build one. You need 3 - 6 months of cash stock piled to pay your monthly necessities. 6 - 9 months if you want to be conservative. You can do this by reducing your expenses and cutting out unnecessary spending.\n\nYou can also do this by selling off unnecessary goods and luxury items you may have that you\u2019re not using. You can also do this by taking on side hustles like driving Uber, Uber Eats, postmates, task rabbit, and my personal favorite, Airbnb. If you\u2019re out of a job, your time is crucial, don\u2019t treat it like an extended vacation. Don't take on extra debt.\n\n#2 While you're doing the above, track each dollar with apps like Mint, or Personal Capital to see where your money is going then ask yourself if you can cover your debts for the next few months if you don't have a job. If you cannot, it's important to call your banks and credit cards and ask them about any relief programs you can take advantage of. In the case of real estate and your house, if there is nothing available, the last resort is to ask for \"forbearance\".\n\nHere are links and resources to help you get through these tough times.\n\nUnemployment Resources by State:\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/fkyu8h\/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources\/\n\nTax Payment Extended Until July:\nhttps:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/payment-deadline-extended-to-july-15-2020\n\nMortgage Payments: \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/03\/18\/what-to-do-if-you-cant-make-your-rent-or-mortgage-payments.html\n\nForgiveness from Credit Cards and Banks: https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/finance\/credit-cards\/issuer-assistance-programs-amid-coronavirus-fears\/\n\nNon profit financial counseling: www.nfcc.org\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Today I'm going to spend 100K and make one of the biggest investments of my life. \n\nToday's video is more about investing in the future of my parents by paying off their mortgage and buy their house. Now I personally don't own any real estate, but for my parents, this is the largest asset they will have when they retire. Recently, they've both been laid off and I thought this would be something they could really use in these tough financial times that we're all facing. \n\nIn this video, I took all of my YouTube ad revenue that I received in 2019, went to the bank, and took out a cashier's check. But instead of investing it with Robinhood \/ WeBull \/ M1 Finance like I usually do, I'm just going to surprise my parents.\n\nThe check I withdrew total $75,000 but the taxes I paid overall make the total exceed 6 six figures. The reason my taxes were so high is because in 2019, I was not an S-Corp, which means I could not shelter my business profits from self employment taxes which is medicare and social security. In 2020, I incorporated and I can finally lower my tax burden. However, doing it this way was the best way to invest money because otherwise, my parents would have to front a huge tax bill that I would not want them to pay. \n\nThis was one of my biggest milestones that I've always wanted to achieve, far more than becoming a millionaire investor or building a multiple six figure dividend portfolio.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

More specifically, how to make money by investing in gold. Is it worth your time and money to consider? Or is it better to invest in the stock market? When it comes to investing for beginners (especially), investing in gold can be a smart decision.\n\nBut why do people love gold so much, where does it come from, and how would one invest in gold anyway? Do you buy physical gold on websites like eBay or digital gold through an app like Robinhood? Is there an ETF? These are all questions that we\u2019re going to try to explore today, and the answer may surprise you.\n\nAs far back as ancient times, we used to barter and trade physical goods. But trading physical property was cumbersome and presented its own challenges. So instead, we experimented with things that could REPRESENT those goods, and we played around with all sorts of different commodities like precious stones, silver, copper, and other shiny metals until we settled on something that we all agreed was valuable and desirable. Something that was relatively evenly spread throughout the world, yet still rare enough that no one person or country had control of all of it, and that was gold. \n\nBut we realized the practicality of gold as money had its problems because it was hard to divide, it was heavy, it wasn\u2019t easy to spot a fake, and our neighbors always wanted it for themselves. \n\nInstead, someone rich came along and told us they would hold our gold, in exchange for certificates in the amount of gold we gave them. We entrusted these people to hold on to the gold for us out of convenience. And in return, we made that person, become the most powerful entities in the world - they became the central banks. \n\nWhen it comes to actually investing in gold, there are many ways to do it like through a brokerage like Robinhood (or your favorite brokerage app) or physically owning gold. \n\nAs far as the performance of gold versus something like the S&P500 (the US Stock Market), gold tends to inversely correlated to what the stock market is doing. In other words, when the market is uncertain and there is a recession, gold tends to be the better performing asset class. When the stock market is doing well, gold tends to lag behind investing in the market.\n\nIt can generally be a good idea to invest in gold, especially if you want to use it as a store of value to preserve your wealth in times of economic uncertainty\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

DRIP stands for Dividend Reinvestment Plan, and it allows you to be paid dividends and automatically reinvest them back into the same stocks that paid those dividends. \n\nThese features have a few advantages to normal non automated investing so I wanted to show you an overview and basic tutorial of how to invest for beginners, if you wanted to invest $100 in the stock market.\n\nSome things to note about how Robinhood is treating fractional shares. There are two types of transfers available - partial and full. A full transfer will move your stocks from one brokerage to another (at the cost of $75 via ACATS, Automated Customer Account Transfer Service), and your fractional shares will be sold and the money given to you. A partial transfer will move your stocks and leave the fractional shares in Robinhood.\n\nNo matter which option you choose for your investment, fractional shares cannot be moved from one brokerage to another until they become full shares. \n\nFractional shares also receive dividends in proportion equal to the amount of shares you own in that stock. For example, if you own 10% a stock, you will receive 10% of that dividend payout at the end of the trading day rounded to the nearest penny. \n\nThere is a common misconception that if you reinvest your dividends through DRIP, you don\u2019t actually have to pay taxes on that money. This is a myth, you still have to pay taxes on that money because it is still considered as money you received. \n\nDRIPs and Fractional Shares are important because these features make it easier to get into a habit of investing, which over a long period of time builds good consistent habits, and that\u2019s how wealth is created - as opposed to day trading like most people think when they think of investing. But these features will help make you an automatic millionaire by using compound interest to your advantage.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Is it stocks ? Which kind of stocks? Dividend stocks or something else? Is it perhaps real estate with its ability to borrow cheap money and leverage it during low interest rate periods? Or is it something else? Today I want to share my how to invest for beginners by showing how I'm investing during a recession.\n\nNormally I use WeBull, Robinhood, and M1 Finance as my primary brokers, but today I wanted to show you another investment of mine that I think will outperform all of these by far. At the very least, it's a good hedge as an insurance policy against our current recession. Will the stock market recover? Or will we see lower lows? \n\nI've tried watching and reading millionaires, billionaires, and real estate moguls for dozens of hours, and I wasn't able to find any actionable advice. So I came up with what I thought was the best strategy going forward, not just for passive income and defensive stocks, but also an asset class that may be the future of the financial market.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I think the stock market is an interesting mechanism for building wealth and becoming a millionaire. Unfortunately, I think the near to mid future is extremely uncertain and as a dividend investor, I want to make sure to protect my passive income by cutting as much risk as I possibly can.\n\nJP Morgan recently announced that they\u2019re only loaning money out to people with a 700 credit score and above, and you have to put 20% down, which will exclude most people trying to buy a home.

On top of that, analysts are predicting the economy will go down 40% and in April alone, with the second quarter of the year they\u2019re saying the economy will decline another 30% and they\u2019re expecting to see 25 million people unemployed.\n\nBut underneath the facade, the fundamental truths about a company don\u2019t lie. Some of the things I look at are: Earnings Payout Ratios, Free Cashflow, EPS or Earnings Per Share, Sales Growth, Return on Equity, and their Dividend Yields Safety Scores and history. \n\nAll of those things have taken a huge hit for nearly every company in the stock market and as a result, they\u2019re doing their best to protect whatever cash flow or money they have, to keep themselves from completely going out of business. One of the ways they do this is by firing as many \u201cnon essential\u201d people as possible, but another way they do this, is by cutting their dividends. \n\nIt\u2019s a stark reminder that we are not contractually owed dividends, dividends can be cut if they are unsafe. Usually speaking though, a company\u2019s LAST line of defense is to cut their dividend. They know by cutting their dividend their stock prices will fall very hard. Recently, I had that happen to me with the companies in my portfolio that I have with Robinhood.\n\nI\u2019m going to be selling 8 stocks that I think I could do better with in terms of where to put my money. I\u2019m still going to be a long term investor, but here are my 8 future sales:\n\n #1 - Chatham LODGING Trust - a REIT. Especially right now with lack of travel, and the entire hotel industry getting pummeled, I would rather put my money somewhere safe while we recover in the meantime. Based on my Yield on Cost of 6.67%, I will be losing roughly $211 of annual income. \n\n#2 - The second company we\u2019ll be selling today is GPS. Their earnings per payout ratio in the last 12 months was an unhealthy 112% of everything they made. That means they literally paid MORE money to shareholders than they actually made, and the only way to do that is either taking money from your cash reserves, OR use debt to pay shareholders like some of the energy stocks are doing right now.\n\n#3 - Pebblebrook Trust Hotel, another REIT. Again, REITS are getting pummeled, similar reasons as CLDT. Looking at the big picture, they are unlikely to be profitable in the next 3 years. It also underperformed the REIT market as a whole , because it lost me -63.7%, while US REITS returned -11% in the same time.\n\n#4 - SKT, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, another REIT.\n\n#5 - BP, an oil stock. With a safety score of only 30, that means it\u2019s unsafe. They have a payout ratio of 413% of their income, they\u2019re paying WELL in excess of 4 times what they make. Not a good sign of things to come.\n\n#6 - CZNC Citizens and Northern which is a bank that has failed to grow it\u2019s dividend last year with a flat EPS growth in the last 5 years.\n\n#7 - DIN Brands Global, payout ratio is below 50%, sales growth has been 17% the last 2 years, operating margin above 16% which is good restaurants but the safety score is still pretty low at 33. Restaurants I feel are a pretty risky play at the moment and this one cut it's dividend in the last recession.\n\n#8 - HBI which is Hanes Brands\n\nThat represents my future stock sales that will lose me roughly $712 of annual dividend income. \n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

You should have received $1200 if you make $75k per year or less, which is most of America. IF you make more than that much of Adjusted Gross Income, which can be found on line 8b of your 1040 tax form, it will phase out $5 for each $100 after that, until it completely disappears at $99,000. Or $112,500 for head of household, or $150,00 if filing jointly as a married couple.\n\n#2 I\u2019m getting the PAYMENT STATUS NOT AVAILABLE when I check the status of my payment. \n\nIf you live on something like 123 Main St, you may want to try putting in 123 Main, and drop the street. If you live on a street like 123 Abraham St. SW, then you would drop St. AND SW so it would be just 123 Abraham. Also try running your address through the USPS Zip Code look up tool. You can enter your address and USPS will give you the proper formatting: https:\/\/tools.usps.com\/zip-code-lookup.htm?byaddress\n\n#3 My Bank is not working, I can\u2019t check my balance: That\u2019s normal right now, everyone is checking every single day, all their systems are crashing, so here\u2019s something to try: most bank accounts should have this feature where you can set an automatic notification to be emailed or notified about any deposits over a certain threshold. Set it to something like $100, and you\u2019ll be automatically notified if you get a deposit.\n\n#4 What if my bank account is not the same as my previously filed tax years? In that case, the IRS will mail the check to you if you couldn\u2019t use \u201cget my payment\u201d to set up direct deposit. \n\n#5 What if I owe money? The IRS will not take your money or \u201cgarnish\u201d your stimulus check if you owe taxes, but banks can come after your check if you are overdrawn on your account.\n\n#6 Why didn\u2019t I receive the $500 dependent credit? If you\u2019re trying to get the $500 dependent credit because you have a child, your child has to be 16 or younger to qualify. If you qualify but did not receive it still, it's best to get in touch with the IRS directly.\n\n#7  I\u2019m a college student, will I receive my money? If someone claimed you as a deponent then you will not receive it unfortunately. But if you\u2019re working and paying taxes, and you meet all the other income criteria, you should receive it. \n\n#8 Will I receive my money by check or by direct deposit? You will receive your money the same method you received your tax refund last year. If you didn\u2019t get it through direct deposit, you will be mailed a check. However, the IRS released a new tool called \u201cGet My Payment\u201d where you can set up direct deposit.\n\n#9 What if I had a change of address from the last time I filed taxes?  Here is what you do, the quickest way is to hop on with a live IRS agent, the best time is early in the morning: 1-800-829-1040. Alternatively, you can fill out the change of address form: https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f8822.pdf \n\n#10 What if I don\u2019t have a bank account? The IRS will begin sending paper checks April 24th, with 5 million checks mailed each week to the people with the lowest adjust gross income, it will take between May to September for people to get their checks. If you want to speed that up, use the Get My Payment tool to get direct deposit. They\u2019re starting Phase 2 today, another 15 million direct deposits.\n\n#11 Do I owe taxes on this money? No you will not.\n\n#12 Can I Quit And Receive Unemployment? No you cannot.\n\n#13 I\u2019m on social security, will I receive a check? YES you will, you don\u2019t have to have paid taxes to be eligible to receive the check if you\u2019re on social security benefits either.\n\n#14 What if I\u2019m NOT a US citizen or I\u2019m a DACA recipient. Will I still get my money? YES, but In that case, you need your social security number or your Individual Taxpayer Identification Number to qualify. You have to be here legally and actually be paying taxes.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I want to share with you what congress is proposing because there\u2019s several ideas on the floor that look very similar to this concept of UBI or otherwise known as Universal Basic Income. \n\nThe CARES Act has given people a one time cash payment of up to $1200 (the stimulus check)but a lot of people are STILL waiting for their stimulus checks with most saying that it\u2019s simply not enough to keep their life going. \n\nA NEW stimulus bill will be voted on TODAY, April 20th, that proposes an additional $300 BILLION dollars for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $75 billion for hospitals, $50 billion for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), and another $25 billion for testing kits, for a grand total of $450 BILLION additional dollars. \n\nThis whole stimulus narrative is bringing us closer and closer, to what seems like an inevitable solution. Everyone in America will be given entitlements to a basic standard income whether or not you have a job. This is the ultimate cash flow in the form of passive income.\n\nTwo main proposals right now for more relief adding to the Cares Act from the Trump Administration. \n\nThe first proposal of UBI is the $2,000 MONTHLY income that was just recently proposed called the Emergency Money For The Peoples Act. \n\nAnyone ages 16 and over who makes less than $130,000 will receive $2,000 a month in this proposal. This includes all the people who were actually left out of the CARES Act which includes people who were claimed as dependents and didn\u2019t get their checks:\n\nPeople with disabilities, college students, and high school students who were not able to get the $1200 stimulus check. However, this proposal is only 6 months, and not indefinite Universal Basic Income.\n\nThe second proposal is called the Rent & Mortgate Payements Through The Yorona Illness Emergency (full name modified). If approved, it calls for a nationwide cancellation of rent and mortgage payments for up to one year. \n\nThe bill includes full rent OR mortgage payment forgiveness on your primary residence. This debt will not accumulate or add up, it\u2019s all forgivable to both renters and homeowners with no negative impact on the credit rating OR rental history. \n\nThose are just some of the proposals congress is considering. However, if we were to assume that EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the US ages 18 and up, got a basic universal income of $1,000 per month, it would cost the US government, 3 TRILLION DOLLARS per year. \n\nThat\u2019s around 3\/4th or roughly 75% of the budget the US government spent in all of 2019 which was 4.4 trillion dollars. And if you exclude people ages 65 and over who are collecting social security, you\u2019d only reduce the cost of it by 1\/5th. \n\nSo in order to fund this program without cutting out any programs, you\u2019d need to almost DOUBLE the federal revenue. And there\u2019s just NO WAY of doing that without drastically increasing taxes or reducing or restructuring our social programs as we know it. \n\nIn comparison, the whole CARES Act relief package that our government passed has totaled $1.76 TRILLION dollars in cost not actually 2.2. trillion. But is it worth it?\n\nThat's what we'll discuss today, the pros and cons of this stimulus environment and about having universal basic income.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I think people need to proceed with caution. Here\u2019s what we know: We know the entire economy is frozen, the stock market is irrational, and we're in a recession. But just how bad is it going to get? We have the fed printing money, we're giving recession checks to everyone in the US in the form of Universal Basic Income, and it\u2019s free money for everyone including businesses at the cost of trillions of dollars. Now our future is uncertain.\n\nHow should we invest in the stock market now? As a dividend investor with Robinhood, I had a few questions myself about how to invest my money. I got the opportunity to speak with former hedge fund manager Raoul Pal from Goldman Sachs. He had a lot of great insight. Here are some questions I asked him about the future of dividends, real estate, the stock market, crypto, gold, futures, and more.\n\nFirst, I asked Raoul about the \u201cdoom loop\u201d, what does that mean exactly and how is it caused in the economy? What is the major financial issue of the \"Corporate Debt Bubble\u201d and the insolvency that may follow. What does that mean?\n\nOn the whole, we can assume that corporations are the net buyer of the stock market through share buy backs. This is accomplished by issuing debt. However, the current situation does not allow for a conducive debt creating mechanism. \n\nIn addition to that, an entire generation of wealthy boomers are retiring. This means they are going to spend less money in retirement - meanwhile, millennials are broke. So if companies STOPPED, buying stocks, the stock market would be a \"net seller\". Does that mean going forward, we should expect to see much lower returns and yields in the stock market ? Will we still see corporate buy backs on the same level?\n\nAre we going to recover soon or is this going to get worse, and just how much worse can this situation get? Apparently there are a lot of bubbles creating a perfect storm for a massive market crash.\n\nI think these are all extremely important topics for investing for beginners and beyond. The next few questions I asked Raoul is how we can use this knowledge to benefit our money in the future. His answers may surprise you. \n\nThe overall message of this video is to use caution when investing in the current environment. I'm still a long term dividend investor that will continue to focus on dividends and collecting passive income checks. It's almost like I have a personal stimulus check of my own every single month that isn't relying on the government. Either way, there are alternative asset class investments to dividends, and the equities market like real estate, gold, and more!\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

It\u2019s a federal law that prevents the consumer, from making more than 6 withdrawals or transfers from our savings accounts OR money market accounts PER MONTH. \n\nThese rules were in place to protect the banks so that they could have enough money in their system to meet minimum money or \u201creserve requirements.\u201d The federal reserve is now allowing all banks to get rid of the 6 per month withdrawal \/ transfer limit. This will allow for more freedom to pay with, and move your money across accounts without being penalized. \n\nHowever, there is a catch because the policy on the federal reserve website reads, \u201c The interim final rule permits, but does not REQUIRE, depository institutions to suspend enforcement of the six transfer limit\u201d. \n\nThis means\u2026.the Federal Reserve ALLOWS, but does not REQUIRE this from banks, so some banks may opt out of this change and actually continue doing business as usual while sticking to their old rules and fee structures.\n\nThe second stimulus proposal for the CARES Act is now in phase 3.5, and some of the proposals include free rent, and $2,000 for each and every person in the United States ages 16 and older. You can also be claimed as a dependent, not have a social security card, or even be a citizen. After that, you will be given a DEBIT card, where the government will deposit $1,000 stimulus money each and every month for up to 1 year after the illness is over.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I wanted to speak with someone who runs and approves the applications for this process to get an insider's perspective regarding what it takes to get approved. \n\nThe PPP was meant for the little guy, the self employed, and the small business owner. Recently, the banks have been in involved in legal trouble due to favoring their wealthier corporate clients. As a result, much of the \"stimulus check\" money in this program has been slow to distribute to people that actually need it. In fact, large corporations were able to get a hold of the SBA PPP loan without actually needing it, and some corporations were forced to send the money back.\n\nAs a result, smaller, private equity lenders have been able to process the applications far quicker. I wanted to contribute a way to get this loan approved by asking Andrew Cartwright some commonly asked questions about this program.\n\nQ: Who's eligible for this program? \nA: Anyone who's self employed or a small business owner. That means Uber driver, Lyft driver, postmates, Airbnb hosts, videographers, photographers, and many more who participate in the gig economy that make a side hustle income can potentially be qualified for a forgivable loan.\n\nQ: How much money can someone get from this? \nA: The math is simple. Regardless of how much money you make, you may only use a maximum yearly limit of $100,000. Therefore, whatever number you use, you divide by 12, and multiply by 2.5. So if you use $100,000 \/ 12 = 8,333. Multiply that result by 2.5 and the final amount is $20,833 which is how much I was able to get approved.\n\nQ: Do you have to pay it back? \nA: It can be forgivable. It's structured as a 1% loan that needs to be paid back within 6 months, but can be deferred for another six months if you choose. However, the loan must be paid back within two years. It must also be used exclusively for \"payroll\" - meaning, you have to pay your employees or yourself no more than 75% of that money, and 25% which can go toward rent, mortgate, utilities, etc. For more specific details: https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\/coronavirus-relief-options\/paycheck-protection-program\n\nQ: - How does one go about getting their loan forgiven?\nA: You are responsible for keeping track of the money using a separate bank account and bank statements. If you can prove that this money was used in the specified time frame, and is within the guidelines of the SBA, the loan will be forgiven. \n\nQ: Can I use this money to pay down loans or THEORETICALLY invest it into a higher yielding investment like dividend stocks?\nA: It's not advised but the government hasn't yet defined clear cut rules as to how the 1% loan can be used. In theory, it is possible, but unclear and not something that's advisable. \n\nQ: What will you do with your loan Andrei?\nA: I will be giving it back to the system so that other people can take advantage of it. I just wanted to make sure it was legit. I don't want to recommend something I wouldn't otherwise use or do myself. \n\nPlease use this money and this opportunity responsibly. It's a small contribution to helping people get approved for their loans to keep small businesses and self employed individuals afloat while we get through these tough times. \n\nCitation:\nScreenshots From the Following Articles: \nhttps:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/04\/29\/847582203\/loopholes-in-small-business-relief-program-allowed-thriving-companies-to-cash-in\nhttps:\/\/smartasset.com\/financial-advisor\/ppp-out-of-money\n\nFintechs to Apply With:\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@journey_finance\/list-of-fintech-companies-helping-with-sba-ppp-paycheck-protection-program-ec14f80f60ec\n\nBanks Prioritization of Larger Clients:\nhttps:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2020\/04\/21\/lawsuit-accuses-large-banks-of-prioritizing-larger.aspx","publishedAt":"2020-05-01T17:12:57Z","tags":["stimulus","stimulus check","sba ppp loan","sba ppp loan application","ppp loan application","eidl","ppp","paycheck protection program","stimulus package","cares act","stimulus loan","sba","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","real estate investing","stock market investing","investing for beginners","how to make passive income","robinhood","robinhood app","how to be a millionaire","federal reserve","stock market","andrei jikh","stimulus checks","PPP loan"],"title":"FED UPDATE: Paycheck Protection Program  (5-1-2020)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tJkl24NX8aI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tJkl24NX8aI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tJkl24NX8aI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tJkl24NX8aI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tJkl24NX8aI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"694","dislikeCount":"128","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3876","viewCount":"91559"}},{"id":"AynS46MX3z8","snippet":{"description":"Are dividends going away?

As you may or may not know, the ultimate luxury that money can buy is time. The way I chose to achieve that goal is to invest that money at the golden 4% payout rule, and doing that in theory will pay all my bills.\n\nBut with the stock market in turmoil, and everything else going on, are dividends safe anymore? Are dividends finally going away? This is a scary thought for passive income investors and today I wanted to take a look at my portfolio with Robinhood to show you exactly where I'm at because my dividends are being cut.\n\nOn top of that, Warren Buffet, the smartest and one of the wealthiest investors of all time has decided to sell all his airline stocks including Delta Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines. This is not a good sign. \n\nFurthermore, oil stocks have plunged into some of the lowest prices they've ever seen and they're starting to cut dividends. More bad news. Now I want to compare my passive income from April of 2019, to this year's April of 2020 to see just how much income I have lost.\n\nBut first, why did Warren Buffet sell the airlines? In short, he believes that the future of the airline industry will no longer be the same at least for the foreseeable future. To quote him, \"The world has changed for airlines, and I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s changed\u201d, He also said he wasn\u2019t sure whether or not the airlines will be able to recover in the future and if the demand for travel will be there in the next 3 to 4 years. Because of this uncertainty, Warren Buffet decided to sell these stocks.\n\nIn addition to that, the following companies from my portfolio also experienced dividend cuts: Shell (RDS.B), Unilever for $2 per year and CNP, Center Point Energy which cut the dividend by 48%, losing me $39 annually, and VTI which has lost $6. All in all, this represents a loss of $208 per year. That\u2019s roughly the equivalent of investing $5,200 at 4%. \n\nHowever, I got a dividend increases too: Johnson and Johnson, $17 a year, raising it\u2019s dividend by 6.3%. $2 from Qualcomm with an a raise of 4.8%, Southern Company at 3.2% for $3, Travelers company for 3.7% or $2 for my position, Kinder Morgan raising it 5% for $3 per year, and $7 per year or 6.5% from Apple. \n\nIn April of 2020, I was paid from PRECISELY 30 companies. Last year, I made exactly $440.41. This year in 2020, in April, I made $475.47. That\u2019s an INCREASE of 7.9% from previous year. Not bad considering all the job layoffs, oil markets crashing, and everything else going on in the economy.\n\nDividends are here to stay, but we may see a slowed growth for the next 3 to 4 years until we recover.\n\nSources and further readings: \nWarren Buffet Sells Airlines: https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-52518186\nDividends Historical Performance: https:\/\/www.gafunds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/imdf_WhyDividendsMatter.pdf\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

But if you haven\u2019t been keeping up, the government without publicly announcing, has just cut down the EIDL.\n\nThe emergency injury disaster loan program which was meant for small businesses, and separate from the PPP, down to a $150,000 from their original promise of $2,000,000. This means many small business owners will most likely have to declare bankruptcy. \n\nThe reason they did this: is because they want agriculture businesses to have the priority and because there is such a huge demand and funding is drying up. This will have bad consequences because I used to work for a startup and I think small businesses are the backbone of America and without them, you\u2019re going to see a lot more unemployment which only make things worse.\n\nHere all the stimulus package phases we've been through so far:\n\nPHASE 1: was around $8.5 billion dollars to support research in development for vaccines, which was passed on March 5.\n\nPhase 2: was a little larger at $105 BILLION dollars, which passed on March 18 and gave people paid sick leave, insurance for unemployment, and free testing.\n\nPhase 3: was $2 TRILLION dollars passed on March 25th, the LARGEST stimulus plan in history. This is the one that with direct payments to us, small businesses, and support for healthcare.\n\nPhase 3.5 Included $484 billion dollars to replenish some of what was offered in previous phases. \n\nNow we\u2019re entering the PHASE 4 of the stimulus plan between the democrats, and the republicans to provide some more relief. \n\nThe democrats are writing A bill that includes more than $750 BILLION in aid to state and local governments which would REALLY help people like teachers, police officers, and firefighters. So most likely, we will see some sort of a compromise or agreement here however;\n\nThe Democrats are also asking for extending unemployment benefits of $600 per week, PLUS potentially another round of aid to Americans most likely in the form of another stimulus check. In addition to that, the $2,000 a month stimulus check bill is back - this time proposed by senators Bernie Sanders, Ed Markey, And Kamala Harris. If passed, everyone who makes under $120,000 a year will get $2,000 a month. Married couples would receive $4,000. Families would receive $2,000 per child for up to three children, and payments would be paid retroactively to as far back as March.\n\nURGENT NEWS: for all Robinhood investors and shareholders of Disney: they decided to cut their dividends which is unfortunate because as a dividend investor myself, I, along with many other people like retirees, rely on this dividend as a form of passive income to supplement my lifestyle and pay for my bills. \n\nFINANCIALLY speaking this is a very smart move for them, saving them roughly $1.6 BILLION dollars this summer alone, allowing them to survive.\n\nFor further research, please look at these articles:\n\nDEMOCRATIC PROPOSALS: https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ryanguina\/2020\/05\/08\/a-new-2000-monthly-stimulus-payment-proposed-by-senators-harris-sanders-and-markey\/#13a948951de0\n\n$2,000 A Month Stimulus proposed by 3 Democratic Senators: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2L9KU9a\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Which is a really interesting theory considering I recently did a video that\u2019s completely the opposite about why the stock market has a decent chance of falling.\n\nIn that specific video, I talked with Raoul Pal, his theory was that the whole economic system right now is on the brink of collapse because of what\u2019s called the \u201cinsolvency\u201d crisis. \n\nThat means it\u2019s where companies don\u2019t have enough money to pay their debt because they aren\u2019t making any money due to the shutdown, which creates a negative feedback loop throughout the entire economy affecting pensions, stock markets, real estate markets, bond markets, and everything in between lose a lot of value from which there is no escape. He also may have been wrong because the stock market, might just explode and be worth a LOT more soon.\n\nIn an effort to keep the economy going, the Federal Reserve has plunged interest rates down to between 0 to 0.25% of a percent, cutting it close to negative interest rate territory. We\u2019re not negative just yet, but the futures market is pricing in negative interest rates by 2021. \n\nSo does this affect us? Here's what will happen to the stock market and dividends if rates were to go negative. The good news with all the excess money, is people will likely be buying and reinvesting it into pensions, hedge funds, stocks, and that will drive the stock market as a whole - upwards. This also includes companies that pay dividends. You\u2019ll also see many corporations use this as an opportunity to borrow a TON of free money.\n\nHowever, negative interest rate policy will make the stock market an illusion because corporations will start to borrow tons of FREE money in order to buy back their own stocks causing the stock prices to higher - and it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll have learned from this current situation we\u2019re in.\n\nWhat about real estate? Both good and bad, here's why: the good thing is that you can borrow money cheaper and easier, but this also drives the prices of homes higher.\n\nThis is especially true for the average home cost where people will rush to take out a cheap loan that basically pays them to have, only to end up buying a house that\u2019s potentially more than they can afford because - FREE MONEY. And because negative interest rates IN THEORY, should not last that long, once the interest rates reverse to normal, home buyers can lose a lot of value on their homes as their prices adjust back down to reality. Remember, the higher the interest rate is, the lower the home prices, and vice versa - the lower the interest rate, the higher the home prices.\n\nHow does this affect average ordinary every day people, the savers? Negative interest rates effectively get rid of how much money banks can earn on our deposits, so banks can potentially stop loaning money and just sit on cash because they don\u2019t want to get penalized. This can implement a borrowing freeze on the economy.\n\nAnd if you have a savings account, especially one with a bank like ally bank which is supposed to be a high yield savings account, you\u2019re no longer going to earn any money on it which means if you\u2019re relying on that for income or stability, you\u2019re going to be pushed to take bigger risks by investing in the stock market or elsewhere to see similar returns or forced to literally hold cash.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

The entire HEROES act consists of close to 2,000 pages of legislation.\n\nThe Heroes Act bill will cost the US 3 TRILLION DOLLARS. Just for context, the Great Recession of 2008, when I graduated high school, cost America $700 BILLION dollars, and so far, the CARES act has cost approximately $2 TRILLION DOLLARS, we\u2019ve nearly TRIPLED the amount of money that we\u2019ve spent so far. All together, America could be spending as much as 5 TRILLION DOLLARS, that\u2019s 7 times worse than 2008.\n\nHere's what's in the bill that just passed in the House of Representatives: \n\n#1 $75 BILLION dollars will be put to \u201cPublic Health and Social Services Emergency Fund\u201d which gives puts money for the yorona testing and containment measures.\n\n#2 $45 BILLION will be given to the Student Loan Debt Forgiveness Program which suspends all payments and interest on student loans until September 2021 to those who are deemed \u201ceconomically distressed\u201d. All this means is that you don\u2019t have to make a single payment and you won\u2019t be penalized until September 30th 2021, but you\u2019re still required to pay back those loans. You can also get up to $10,000 forgiven on your loans if you can prove you are economically distressed.\n\n#3 $100 BILLION will be given to the Emergency Rental Assistance provision which gives protection to low income people from being evicted from their homes. To be considered \u201clow income\u201d you need to be making less than 80% of what the average income is in YOUR specific area is, which will be provided by the Secretary. Another $75 BILLION dollars will be given to home owners to protect them from foreclosure if they\u2019re not able to make payments on time.\n\n #4 $200 BILLION will go toward the support for FRONTLINE workers including medical staff and first responders. There\u2019s another provision that includes 2 weeks of paid sick leave and 12 weeks - 3 months of emergency paid leave if you meet certain criteria.\n\n#5 15% MORE money for SNAP the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program which is also known as the food stamp program. This translates to about a $25 per person per month, or just under $100 for a family of 4.\n\nNow here are some of the more problematic proposals with the bill that Republicans are generally against:\n\n#1 Cash payments to illegal immigrants and their families. That\u2019s right, illegal immigrants would be eligible to receive not only the next round of stimulus check if they get sent, but also the first round of stimulus checks that was sent out in April depending on their income levels. \n\n#2 Page 1762 of The bill mandates that all ICE Detainees, that is - immigrants who committed a crime that were placed in jail by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall be released if they do not pose a threat to the general public. A crime doesn\u2019t have to be a violent offense, it could be something like overstaying your visa for example. Included are new standards that contain free privileges to talk to their families because right now no one is able to visit those centers.\n\n#3 Illegal immigrants that are considered essential workers will be protected from being deported and they will be given the okay to work a job without penalizing the companies that hired them.\n\n #4 Immigrants that want to come here and practice medicine, especially as it relates to the illness, will be given expedited visas to come here and work. This is to help the hospital shortage that we have of medical workers helping us out in the front lines.\n\n#5 Unauthorized immigrants without healthcare coverage will able to qualify for testing at no cost, treatment, and vaccines.\n\nThe Bill: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2z95Smb\nNational Deficit: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3bN6laN\nFood Stamps Eligibility: https:\/\/www.fns.usda.gov\/snap\/recipient\/eligibility\nPaid Sick Leave Expansion: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2LAWcUe\nStimulus For Illegal Immigrants: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3g3x3iL\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Many people believe that this is something the central powers of the world have been planning for us for quite some time, and they just haven\u2019t found a good opportunity to do it. \n\nUntil now. If you notice throughout history, during times of a crisis, the government gets ONE STEP CLOSER, to give us a peace of mind - to give us protection, but instead: what actually ends up happening is, we lose a little bit more of our freedoms along the way - in exchange for a little more convenience.\n\nHow will this affect the stock market? How will this affect our investing, dividends, real estate, and everything else? \n\nThis is what has happened to cash recently: Italy has made cash transactions over $1,000 euros illegal, Russia has banned cash transactions of over $10,000, Australia is banning cash over $10,000, Spain over $2,500 Euros, Mexico $200,000 pesos, and France at $1,000 Euros. \n\nBut here's the good and the bad to getting rid of cash, starting with the good.\n\nThe Good:\n1. It\u2019s argued that the biggest advantage to going cashless is a reduction in criminal activity. By using digital forms of money, the government prevents illicit activity, the counterfeiting of money, and will significantly reduce money laundering. \n\nIt\u2019s estimated that in a SINGLE year, criminals can launder between 2% to 5% of the Gross Domestic Product, the GDP of the entire WORLD. That equals to roughly anywhere between 1.7 to 4.3 TRILLION dollars per year, and that is a MASSIVE out of reach market. \n\n2. Businesses would streamline a lot of profit by cutting costs necessary to store and track CASH. According to statistics 5% of all business revenue, is lost due to theft. Can you imagine what this would do to stock prices?\n\n3. It would cut the time down to process non cash transactions by at least 15%, which means more customers can actually buy things and instead of having to wait in line. It also means businesses can significantly reduce the cost of processing cash, transporting it, counting it, and hiring people to manage the cash registers. Which in turn, would further reduce the chance for that cash being stolen by employees as well.\n\n4. One of my favorite benefits is tracking our money. The best way to start saving 50% of your income, and investing that money is to start keeping track of where it's going. We can\u2019t do that with cash as well so this is definitely a plus.\n\n5. The best benefit of going cashless which is how this idea will ultimately be sold to us as something we need right now is - it helps prevent the spread of germs.\n\nNow let's take a look at the other argument against implementing a cashless society. \n\n1. We give up choice and control to the banks, to the fed, and the IRS thus making them MUCH more powerful than they already are. For example, during the cryptocurrency boom that happened in 2017, banks started banning people and forcefully CLOSING ACCOUNTS of customers who were transferring money to perfectly legal brokerages. The banks didn\u2019t like the competition, so they forced people off and closed accounts.\n\n2. By having access to cash, this limits the power the Fed has over the effects of it\u2019s monetary policy. For example, during the European debt crisis, when the European Central Bank ordered negative interest rates of -.1%, in order to incentivize spending instead of saving, all that did, was it forced people to save more money and what people did instead, was withdraw their cash rather than keep it in the bank. One can argue that by having cash, we can \u201cfight the fed\u201d by having a say over what happens to our money.\n\n3. Data is the new age gold. And by going 100% digital, we are giving up all sense of privacy. That means whoever has our data about how we spend money, can use that to create a digital blueprint about our habits, and even our location at any given time.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

It sounds impossible. Let\u2019s run the numbers real quick: $180,000 a day, let\u2019s assume an average month is 31 days (30.44 but we'll round up), that equals $5,580,000 a month, which if you multiply by 12, you get $66,960,000, and if you multiply that yearly income, by 2020 years, you get $135,259,200,000. MEANING: if you earned, 180k a day, for 2020 years, you would arrive today, and realize - Jeff Bezos still has a higher net worth (billions more).\n\nIf the 2020 financial crisis has showed us anything it\u2019s that we need to start saving money and not live paycheck to paycheck or risk having to wait weeks for stimulus checks that for some people, still have not arrived yet. Not to mention the Fed printing more money, which leads to inflation.\n\nI wanted to revisit the idea of saving money because recently I saw Graham Stephan do a video about not saving money because that\u2019s what can cause the economy to potentially not recover. And while that may be true, we should still save aggressively, because many of the millions of people that have lost their jobs in the 2020 recession - like my dad, may never get them back. \n\nSo how much money should you save and what should your net worth be? The AVERAGE net worth of an American is $692,000, that number is skewed because of how rich people in America can be - like the CEO of Amazon.\n\nThe MEDIAN net worth here in the US is only about $97,000. That\u2019s taking all your \u201cliabilities\u201d or your debts, and subtracting them from your assets - and remember, they include your house, your 401k, your savings, your stocks including dividend stocks, bonds, etc.\n\nBelieve it or not, in a book published in 1996 called The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America\u2019s Wealth, the authors found that MILLIONAIRES, are more commonly found in middle or blue collar class income levels, than in white collar class - higher earning levels.  \n\nHere\u2019s how we can calculate whether or not you\u2019re doing a good job saving money, using a formula created by Dr. Thomas Stanley, author of the Millionaire Next Door. 3 DIFFERENT scores, rated UAW which means under accumulator of wealth, that\u2019s the one you don\u2019t want to be. Then there\u2019s AAW which is average accumulator of wealth, and then there\u2019s PAW - prodigious achiever of wealth. \n\nYou take your age, then you multiply it by your annual income (before paying taxes), so let\u2019s say I make $100,000 a year and then you divide the result by 10. When I started 2020, my next worth was around $300,000 , which is taking everything into consideration, my debts which I have none, and my assets, which besides my stock account with Robinhood, WeBull, and M1 Finance - I don\u2019t have anything else. The result of that formula gives me an answer of $310,000 which is very close to where I am today. What does this mean?  \n\nThat means, I\u2019m considered an AAW. An \u201caverage accumulator of wealth\u201d. \n\nIf you're curious how your net worth compares to the above average net worth person in the US, here some more numbers. \n\n22 years old $0\n23 years old $20,000\n24 years old $46,000\n25 years old $79,000\n\nAt age 30, 5 years later, the above average net worth is $250,000. Which goes up to $429,000 by 35, $660,000 by 40, $914,000 by 45. In your mid 40s, is when the above average net worth individual becomes a millionaire and compound interest makes more money than most people's day jobs.\n\nPlease check out Financial Samurai's blog, he's incredible and will challenge many of your preconceptions about money: https:\/\/www.financialsamurai.com\/the-average-net-worth-for-the-above-average-person\/\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

So what\u2019s the #1 biggest investing mistake right now? Let\u2019s go back in time to the year 1951, when a woman by the name Thelma Howard was hired by Walt Disney to be his personal cook and housekeeper. While she was working as his housekeeper, she gained the family\u2019s trust, and friendship. In return, every Christmas and every birthday, Mr. Disney gave Thelma shares of his company\n\nThelma never sold those stocks though. She held on to them for dear life and Eventually, those stocks became worth \u2026..over $9 million dollars, and that money was equally dividend between her son and her foundation which now supports artistic programs in the LA county. The moral of that story is\u2026. LONG TERM investing of BUYING & HOLDING STOCKS - will almost ALWAYS beat short term, stock trading strategies.\n\nNow personally, I\u2019m a DIVIDEND investor and I wish EVERYONE knew what that was because I think it\u2019s the coolest way to invest in the stock market. It\u2019s when companies make so much money, they pay their shareholders for owning their stock.\n\nDespite this knowledge, millennials are shown to be largely be left out of investing in the stock market, until recently. Typically speaking, when the economy is doing well, people are more loose with money and don\u2019t pay much attention to the personal finance. But now the sky has fallen, the economy is in shambles and suddenly, people are interested in managing their money better, and investing it. Which is always good - but also bad. \n\nPeople are gambling and speculating with what little money they have by putting in the stock market and then trying to learn day trading. Believe it or not, people are using parts of their stimulus checks for trading in the stock market too. In fact, data shows that people earning $35,000 to $75,000 traded stocks 90% MORE than right before they received their stimulus checks. Also, people that make between $100k to $150k saw an increase in 82% in trading. Brokerages like Robinhood for example reported a 300% increase of trading activity in March alone. \n\nAll this means is that, people are getting interested in investing, they\u2019re experiencing the fear of missing out on the \u201cV\u201d shaped recovery that some economists are expecting. It seems like we\u2019re experiencing the V shape recovery now but most of those people, 90% or more will likely lose money trading stocks in the short term if things don\u2019t go the way they expect or worse, they continue day trading thinking they\u2019re successful when they\u2019re actually losing money due to \u201crandom reinforcement\u201d theory.\n\nI did a video on May 11, that said the stock market was going to explode, which was my theory that the stock market was going to recover INSANELY fast because of the Fed\u2019s policies and our optimism for a quick recovery, and after the video was published, you can see the S&P500 graph, the stock market blasted off. However, there are problems ahead. We\u2019re going to see entire industries displaced and while the tech sector will boom - the restaurant industry will be hurting AND this will be made worse by what\u2019s about to happen to commercial real estate in about 2 years from now as their debt comes due. \n\nAt the end of the day, you should only invest what you\u2019re willing to lose and nothing more. If it makes you feel uneasy about investing a certain dollar amount, it\u2019s probably because that amount of money means a lot to you, so you shouldn\u2019t be risking it. And If you\u2019ve lost your job, $2,000 or $1,200 stimulus checks in the stock market will only make you a couple hundred extra dollars at best with a blue chip investing strategy like dividend investing in the short term. \n\nThe best way to use that money is to invest it into yourself by learning a new skill, and getting a certification in something valuable like computer programming or something else that\u2019s valuable.\n\nMillennials Aren\u2019t Investing: https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/03\/11\/why-millennials-might-not-care-that-the-stock-market-is-crashing.html\n\nFed Policy: https:\/\/fas.org\/sgp\/crs\/misc\/RL30354.pdf\n\nCommercial Real Estate In Trouble:  https:\/\/daily.jstor.org\/the-commercial-real-estate-markets-impending-crash\/\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Here\u2019s how I build it. My intent is NOT to show off how much money I have, it\u2019s more to show you my journey in real time, and when someone showed me their journey many many years ago, it\u2019s what sparked my interest in personal finance and I think that has incredible value. I\u2019m by no means a millionaire, my journey is happening for everyone to see in real time - along with my successes and my mistakes - which I will make. \n\n#7 - HRL, Hormel Foods, probably a company you\u2019ve never heard of before, but I guarantee you that you\u2019ve bought a product of theirs before.  This stock has grown 47% and it represents Just .3% of my portfolio, which means at some point I need to buy more. \n\nHere\u2019s how I know if I should buy more stocks. I try to have around 1% to 5% of my portfolio. I try not to have more than 10% in any individual company whether that\u2019s by income, or by the actual VALUE of the stock price in relation to my portfolio but for example, if I know I want to own 20 stocks, I know I should aim for no more than 5% of my portfolio in each stock if I want to be 100% even. You can take 100, and divide that by the amount of stocks you want to own to determine that number.\n\nHormel Foods is also paying me around 2% per year. I try to aim for about 4% but not much more than that, the reason I own this one even though it\u2019s only 2% is because it\u2019s been seeing a double digit growth rate at 11% and it has a dividend Safety score of 99 out of 100\n\n #6 is JNJ is a pharma giant which makes up about 6% of my portfolio which is a very large position considering how many stocks I own. \n\nJNJ recently INCREASED it\u2019s dividend by 6% in April, which makes that their 58th year in a row to increase their dividend, despite everything going on in the world, that\u2019s the kind of stability I love to see and makes me sleep well at night. One of the coolest things about Johnson and Johnson is that it\u2019s also got a safety score of 99 and that\u2019s probably the reason why this stock has grown 50.3% for me since I purchased it. I wish I had more of JNJ, one of my favorites. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a 2 star stock, making it expensive to buy right now but I\u2019m always watching it\u2019s price.\n\n#5 UNP Union Pacific, a railroad company which just like MONOPOLY, you gotta own this piece of 32,000 miles of railroad track that has increased 61.6% in the last 5 years alone. \n\n#4 LIN 67.2 At we\u2019ve got Linde which has grown 67.2% since I\u2019ve bought it, Linde has had an uninterrupted growth streak of 28 years, and it will be really interesting to see if they can keep it up throughout this time. If I had to bet my money, considering they have a 99 safety score which is as safe as you can get, I will say YES, they will continue with the dividend increases throughout the economic distress so if you\u2019re seeking modest income and growth while staying safe - I like this stock\n\n#3 GWW - WW Grainger is a company that you probably don\u2019t know much about either. It\u2019s got EVERYTHING to do with providing, maintaining, and repairing tools. This stock has grown a massive 70.37% since I started investing in it, it\u2019s got a VERY healthy balance sheet with ONLY a 33% payout ratio. This means of all the money this company makes, it only pays 33% to shareholders which is WAY below what the average dividend company would pay out. This means more room for growing the 1.86% dividend yield. Though it\u2019s pretty slow with growth, the 48 CONTINUOUS years of dividend payments along with the 99 dividend safety score more than makes up for it\u2019s lower yield. \n\n#2 NSC is another railroad company with almost 20,000 miles of railroad transporting goods with 18 years of continuous dividend increases. This company has increased 85.7% since I bought it almost doubling my money. It\u2019s got an incredible 47% modest payout ratio, 2.1% dividend yield, and 18% growth of the dividend last year which is incredibly high and what you want to look for when a stock is paying you in the low 2% dividend yield. It\u2019s also got a WHOPPING 86 dividend safety score making it one of my favorites. \n\n#1 The BEST stock OVERALL that I have ever bought, is \u2026. ONE GIANT fruit company - Apple, which has increased 178% in price appreciation alone since I began investing in it. \n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Is there a proper way to invest your money in the stock market. The first question is, what do you value most? Passive income? Or do you want to retire later in life with a larger nest egg to sell off at 4%? Regardless of how you want to put your money to work, there are right ways, and there are wrong ways to invest. I did it the wrong way and I learned some expensive mistakes along the way. \n\nUsually I share my investing journey with the Robinhood app, dividends, and my success or lack thereof but I also want to share my failures too, that\u2019s part of the journey - and this is something I haven\u2019t talked about before. This video MAY just change the way you think about investing.\n\nIt all began in 2011 - with a simple google search on \u201chow to make money online\u201d. It was then that I saw an article posted about this mysterious digital currency that promised to be a decentralized peer to peer system of transferring value from one person to another, without an intermediary. I didn't know what any of that meant, what I was more interested in, is how I can make one of something, worth 100 of something.\n\nIn 2014, I bought in, at a price of, $600 per coin. I spent roughly $3,600 on my initial investment and I held on for a little while not understanding what I was investing in. And that was mistake and lesson #1. \n\nYou should always know exactly what you\u2019re investing in, but more importantly, you should know why you\u2019re investing in it. If you don\u2019t understand your investment, whether that\u2019s the stock market, digital currency or real estate, you will lose that investment when the price of it drops. You need to have the right mentality to hold on to your convictions and beliefs.\n\nTwo years later, I saw my initial principal investment fall from $3,600, down to $1,500. Because I lacked an understanding of my what, and my why, I sold it immediately. That expensive mistake cost me my first $100,000 because those 6 coins, went on to become worth over $120,000.\n\nIn 2017, another bull run happened in the market and this is when I made my second costly investing mistake. When we experienced a big price increase, instead of selling and locking in my profits, I decided to hold on to my investment, and letting green rule my better judgement. What I should have done, was sold my initial principal value so that I only invested money that wasn't technically mine.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

That\u2019s because Jerome Powell has turned on infinite QE.\n\nThe federal reserve has been committed to buying up every asset class in order to prop up the economy and as a result of that and a few others things we will be discussing in today\u2019s video, the stock market is now officially in bull market mode. The S&P500 just experienced the BEST 50 trading days of ALL time.\n\nI like to know and follow the stock market not because it\u2019s what drives my decisions as far as how I invest, but because it helps me manage my expectations and emotions so I know what\u2019s coming next as a dividend investor. \n\nFirst let's take a look at the top 3 indexes of the stock market. S&P500, The Dow Jones, and the NASDAQ. These market indexes track the overall performance of the stock market but together they are NOT the stock market, they are not the economy - and they're largely disconnected from main street.\n\nThe NASDAQ, is the second largest index by market cap with 10 trillion dollars worth of assets from about 3,500 stocks, it has hit an ALL TIME HIGH. It\u2019s the reason why people are saying we are now in the new bull market. \n\nBut when asking yourself if you should invest because the indexes are doing great, I\u2019m not so sure that this an accurate judgement of reality. The NASDAQ is heavily overrepresented by the tech sector, and the healthcare sector. I own a lot of healthcare, and some tech. But the tech sector makes up about 50% of the entire nasdaq index.\n\nS&P500 on the other hand tracks the top 500 companies in the United States, experienced the BEST 50 trading days of all time SMASHING the last record set in 1982 when we gained 35.6%, this time, in 2020, we gained almost 40% at 39.6%.\n\nThe Dow Jones on the other hand, has only 30 companies and they aren\u2019t necessarily the largest. It\u2019s only about two thousand points away from hitting all time highs.\n\nThese prices of the top 3 indexes reflect what the United States will look like in about 12 - 18 months - perfection. That\u2019s really what they\u2019re pricing in right now. A swift vaccine, and the recovery of jobs, and not at all a second wave of the illness - which could come back to haunt us in the winter time and cause a second round of shutdowns which would very quickly wipe away all the market gains that we\u2019ve seen thus far. \n\nLet's take a look at how the market and elections are connected. The elections, can\u2019t predict what will happen to the stock market, but the stock market can act like a crystal ball for predicting who will become president. \n\nIt\u2019s fascinating data from lplresearch - if the S&P500 index, the one that tracks the top 500 companies AKA VOO on Robinhood is GREEN 3 months in the time prior to a presidential election that happens in November 2020, the party that\u2019s in the White House or the \u201cincumbent party\u201d, will most likely stay in the White House. But, if the stocks are down 3 months before an election, then it\u2019s a potential sign for a change in power. \n\n20 out of the past 23 last elections have been CORRECTLY predicted by the stock market 3 months prior. That means, there\u2019s an 87% that we will know who the president will be starting around August to September time. \n\nBut here\u2019s another REALITY: over 100,000 people have lost their lives due to the illness and 41 million people are unemployed which are levels that rival the Great Depression\n\nt\u2019s perfectly fair it\u2019s fair to assume that all of this would lead to more job losses, difficulty reopening the economy because of fear which means a generally bad stock market right? Wrong. That\u2019s not what happened. This is why I say whatever most people think will happen, almost always the opposite ends up happening.\n\nEven Warren Buffet sold his airline stocks and lost himself and his investors billions of dollars, and all he had to do was follow through with his long term buy and hold strategy for just a little longer. Point being, no one can predict what will happen but the stock market is forward thinking, and it correctly predicted that the economy will recover. 2.5 million jobs were gained. \n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

It\u2019s called the SEP or the SUMMARY of Economic Projections. Meanwhile, the stock market is painting a rosy picture of the future but if you're investing, you have to be prepared for the consequences. \n\nThe fed is predicting that the GDP, the Gross Domestic Product will contract 6.5%, and that unemployment will be around 9.3% by December. In comparison to what we have now which is around 13.3% so it will be better, but not exactly good. \n\nTo make things worse, I recently saw an article called The Dollar Is Getting Weaker! This immediately made me think of inflation because we\u2019ve been printing so much money - which begs the question, where does all this printed money come from and can it crash the stock market? Could we just print enough money to pay back the national debt of 26 TRILLION dollars and counting? Theoretically, yes, but practically, that would be a very bad idea for the economy. \n\nWhile we won't be printing the money to pay back the national debt, we will be pumping another one trillion dollars this month into the economy to keep the party going.\n\nThere's 2 main reasons for why the stock market dropped really hard: \n\nReason number #1 is that we\u2019re noticing more ill cases popping up, this creates fear and uncertainty in the stock market because a second economic shutdown is what we are afraid of most. \n\nReason #2 is because Jerome Powell just released his prediction about the economy and it wasn't good. Normally, the Fed chairman can sort of act like a cheerleader to help boost the economy, and while his job is to be accurate, he also has to be somewhat optimistic - because that\u2019s in our best interest. If the fed came out and told us that the end is near, then things would be a lot worse. The stock market is smart enough to understand this, so it dropped when the Fed released their prediction. \n\nWith the newly updated dot plot, most fed members have agreed to hold 0% interest rates all the way until 2022 if necessary. That means they\u2019ll do ANYTHING to keep the economy afloat but for now, no interest rate changes.\n\nWhat do higher interest rates mean exactly though? Here's what they mean. When the Fed signals HIGHER interest rates, that means banks are much more profitable, they get to lend money out to us and we pay them more interest, so they make more money. BUT, if the interest rates are low, like they have been and will be for quite some time, is when bank stocks generally don\u2019t do too well, because they don\u2019t make much of a profit. Which is also one of the reasons why bank stocks are generally discounted at todays prices. REITS are similar, when interest rates are high, companies that hold real estate generally tend to see the prices of those assets go up and they make more money so we get to make more money. So interest rates go up, banks and REITS go up as well.\n\nBut what about the dollar and our money getting weaker? If we look at a chart of what the dollar has done in the last 3 months, it looks like it's declining, but the reality is, the last 5 years saw a huge growth of the US Dollar. That\u2019s because the US dollar is the world reserve currency, that means when times are bad, everyone wants to HOLD dollars instead of their native currencies.\n\nWhen the dollar is STRONG, it means it\u2019s cheaper to travel to other places of the world, we have more purchasing power. In relation to the stock market, the currency doesn\u2019t really move the direction of the stock market. Some companies will benefit from it, and others will suffer from experiencing less trade.\n\nA weaker dollar means our goods become much more competitive on a global market, which means not only will other countries want to do more business with us, but it would also encourage us as the consumer to buy more stuff at home.\n\nRead more about currencies here: https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/business-53001248\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Private Equity Funds. For many years, private equity funds have been trying to invade the retirement contribution savings plans that you most likely invest money in. \n\nThis is because that amount of money private equity funds will now have access to is worth roughly $6.2 trillion dollars. That is more than the total value of Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Alibaba, and Berkshire Hathaway - combined.\n\nJust recently, the department of labor cited an executive order from Mr. Donald Trump to \u201cremove barriers to economic growth.\u201d This phrasing now allows private equity to indirectly participate in your portfolios. The problem is, they\u2019re very misunderstood and no one is really talking about how investing in them is a high risk venture.\n\nFirst, let's understand what Private Equity is. What it is, is a giant pool of money that is managed by extremely wealthy millionaires and corporations. They use this money to invest in companies and  potentially buy them outright. One of the worst practices of what they do is something called \"leveraged buy outs\". This is when they borrow money, purchase a company, then dump the entire debt on the company they purchased. This forces the newly purchased company to start cutting costs until eventually, the company goes out of business. \n\nThere's two major problems with investing this way. \n\n#1 They are considered extremely high cost investments because private equity makes a HUGE amount of money on fees for managing YOUR money. In fact, when they sell a company from their portfolio, they can charge their funds fees over $10 million dollars WITHOUT disclosing that to their investors while they eat away at your returns. \n\nThey\u2019re also very difficult to judge in terms of what they are exactly, and if you find out what\u2019s inside your investment and how it\u2019s run because they are not transparent with that information, they are not considered very \u201cliquid\u201d aka - they aren\u2019t easy to sell because they can lock your money in place for 5+ years at a time. \n\nIn 2010 the Dodd Frank Act gave regulators more power to investigate private equity. So the Securities Exchange Commission did some digging and they found that 50% of the private equities they looked at, collected fees inappropriately and have violated rules on how they manage money.\n\n#2 The second reason to be careful is that by taking on greater risk, you\u2019d expect a higher performance. But there\u2019s no conclusive evidence that to shows - long term, private equity funds perform any better than traditional investments like mutual funds, indexes, ETFs, or just individual stocks. \n\nPeople like Warren Buffet are extremely critical of them. In last year\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway meeting with investors, Warren Buffet said \"We have seen a number of proposals from private equity firms where the returns are not calculated in a manner that I would regard as honest\u2026 If I were running a pension fund, I would be very careful about what was being offered to me.\u201d\n\nMore than likely, these funds will not be available to invest in directly, instead, they will be hidden inside your target date funds which according to Fidelity, roughly 52% of all Americans that have a 401k actually own (target date funds). In fact, my parents own a target date fund for 2030.\n\nThis affects everyone in the beginning and middle phases of their careers with a 401k employer sponsored plan, especially if you invest by purchasing these target funds. Please be careful about what you're buying. \n\nHere are some more resources for further research: \nhttps:\/\/www.dol.gov\/agencies\/ebsa\/about-ebsa\/our-activities\/resource-center\/information-letters\/06-03-2020\n\nhttps:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/sec-finds-high-rate-of-fee-expense-violations-at-private-equity-firms-1399411278\n\nhttps:\/\/www.penews.com\/articles\/what-access-to-the-6-2tn-401k-pension-market-means-for-private-equity-20200611\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

I want my money to grow over time and pay me dividends for the rest of my life. But what if these stocks go to zero and become worth zero $0? \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever lost money in the stock market, don't worry - BILLIONAIRE investor Carl Icahn just sold his Hertz stock for 72 cents a share, giving him a whopping 40 million dollars, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that sale cost him $1.8 BILLION DOLLARS of his original investment.\n\nMost people think that a company who\u2019s stock reaches $0, means that it now goes bankrupt. But it\u2019s actually not quite how it works. Stock price follows reality, and it\u2019s stock price that follows bankruptcy. A company must first lose all of it\u2019s money and then it goes out of business, and then the share price drops to $0 - which actually never happens. \n\nIn order for a stock to reach $0, somebody would have to sell their stock for $0, and that would make no sense, you\u2019d just keep it. Otherwise we\u2019d see $0 stocks inside our brokerages. Instead, the stock price just keeps going lower until there are no more people left to buy it.\n\nFor the NYSE, the New York stock exchange, it has a minimum price per share of $1, anything below that means it gets delisted if it holds that value for a long period of time. The NASDAQ, which is another marketplace for stocks has a minimum trading price of $4. But in order to understand exactly how the price of a stock actually works, there\u2019s two major components to it. \n\n#1 Intrinsic Value - or real value of a stock which is determined by adding up all the assets that a company owns, minus the liabilities \/ debts that it has. As long as the result, or the difference between these two is positive, then the company is considered \u201csolvent\u201d. This is not the price we see reflected in our brokerages.\n\n#2 The market price. Which is driven by supply and demand, news, and sentiment of things we see and hear. This is not the most accurate way to judge a stock price, but that's what brokerages like Robinhood will show us. \n\nBut what if you hold those stocks even if they are worthless, because maybe someday, they\u2019ll be worth something again. First, cut your losses and move on. Once the price drops low enough, the stock is delisted, and you no longer own anything of value. Except in some instances where a stock is still trades for fractions of a penny another marketplace in which case you still have some shares but for all intents and purposes, they are worthless.\n\nOnce a company has declared bankruptcy (either Chapter 7, which is total liquidation), or Chapter 11 (which is a restructuring of the corporation), it will issue NEW shares that are indepedent of the old ones that you still have. Investors will buy the new shares, driving your old shares lower in value until they potentially get delisted. Here's a list of priorities that a \"stock\" must pay in order of most to least important.\n\n1. The most important people are the \u201cSECURED\u201d creditors, these are people that loan companies their money which is backed by collateral or property. \n\n2. Once the secured creditors have been paid, the next people in line are the unsecured creditors, which are usually credit card companies that loan their money that is NOT backed by any collateral or property. They make more interest, but they also take more risk.\n\n3. Bondholders. These people hold a promise from the company that the company will pay back all owed debts to bondholders. These people have priority over shareholders as well.\n\n4. Preferred shareholders.\n\n5. Common shareholders - this is you and I. We are always the last in line to get our money when a company goes bankrupt which is why, the common investor almost always gets nothing. This is what's happening to the Hertz stock right now, and I would be very careful investing in companies like that. \n\nUse common sense, and look at a company's quarterly earnings report, as well as any outstanding debt they may have to get a better understanding where the stock is headed. \n\nI'm not a licensed professional, this is not investing advice.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Phase 4 will largely focus on stimulating the manufacturing sector because it has ripple consequences to help other industries like entertainment, hospitality , and transportation which are considered \u201cdiscretionary spending\u201d. The problem is, displacing entire industries, even though they are \u201cnon essential\u201d, can still have ripple consequences on the economy.\n\nTo fight this, here is where the $4,000 comes in. The president asked to \u201cCreate an Explore America Tax Credit that Americans can use for domestic travel, including visits to restaurants, that\u2019s a big deal\u201d. \n\nSo in response, the US Travel Association put together a very specific proposal that the president really likes. In case you\u2019re not sure who they are, they\u2019re a non profit organization that pushes travel interests by way of research and policy in order to get funding and create more jobs to grow the travel industry which right now is responsible for 1 out of 10 of every American jobs.\n\nExplore America gives TAX CREDIT, of up to 50% for all travel expenses including groceries, restaurants, entertainment, business, and gas up to a maximum limit of $4,000. In order to qualify, you have to have a travel expense greater than $50 while traveling away from home, but it has to be within the United States. \n\nThis tax credit would last until December 31st, 2021. However, you can probably see a problem with it already, because we don't actually receive $4,000, it\u2019s a tax write off. \n\nAs far as the $1,200 Stimulus check round 2, the ball is in the Senate's court. The specific days that the Senate Republicans will work on their proposal will be after \u201crecess\u201d which starts July 3rd, and goes until July 17th. \n\nHowever, if they drag it on and nothing gets done, the next key date is August 8th, if nothing then, then we won\u2019t hear back about anything else until September 8th. That\u2019s because there\u2019s another recess for an entire month.\n\nIf by some miracle a proposal is actually passed by all branches of the government, then we\u2019ll see checks sometime August 22nd or 23rd, with most people paid the direct deposits at the beginning of September. That\u2019s the official outlook.\n\nSpecifically what we\u2019ll get, it will hinge on one fact - how big the stimulus package will end up being. The Republican controlled Senate have the smallest package size, they want to limit the stimulus to $1 trillion dollars. President Donald Trump wants at least $2 trillion dollars, meanwhile, we already know the Democrat controlled House Of Representatives want a $3 trillion dollar deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the ONLY proposal that\u2019s actually on paper right now.\n\nThe $600 weekly unemployment benefit is going to expire at the end of July, and the amount of people who are claiming that benefit was 1.5 million people just last week, which makes that the 13th week in a row that more people need the help. But there are some good news: the White House is considering lowering the ceiling from $600, down to $300, or $250 per week as a maximum limit.\n\nNo matter who\u2019s budget plan we go with, the 1 2 or 3 trillion dollars, it would still fit within all the budgets. When they polled Americans back in April, 82% said that $1,200 wouldn\u2019t be enough.\n\nOur GDP has fallen by 5% mostly due to lack of consumer spending. In fact, since January 2020, the richest Americans saw the largest drop to spending habits with a negative 16.8%. Meanwhile, the poorest Americans saw only a -4% drop and the middle class dropped somewhere in the middle at -9.9%. Unfortunately if you\u2019re looking for a NEW job right now, new job postings have declined by 16.4%. The total cost for the economy to recover is estimated to be around $1 TRILLION dollars PER YEAR for the next 3 years to get back to normal.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.tracktherecovery.org\/\nhttps:\/\/www.cnet.com\/personal-finance\/second-stimulus-check-update-is-a-very-dramatic-second-round-in-the-works-todays-status\/\nhttps:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/monetarypolicy\/bst_recenttrends.htm\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

But did you know if we were to get rid of social security today, 48% or nearly 1 out of every 2 people over the age of 65 would be considered living below poverty?\n\nIf you\u2019ve been keeping up with the Cares Act, you might remember that President Donald Trump said this \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything without a payroll tax cut\u201d. \n\nThis means he wants to include payroll tax cuts for our corporations in Phase 4 in order to incentivize businesses to hire us to come back to work which makes sense, the more money businesses can keep, the more likely they\u2019ll use it to pay and hire back their employees.\n\nHowever, guess which program gets the majority of it\u2019s money from Payroll taxes? Social Security. This means there\u2019s a problem because as of the calculations of today, social security is set to run out around 15 years from now but there\u2019s a few things that we need to pay attention to that are about to speed that up.\n\nSocial Security was originally invented out of a need after the Great Depression of 1929 when millions of people were left with no income, no savings, and no job - not unlike what we\u2019re seeing today. The program was created to help out retirees and disabled people in order to supplement some of their income. This program was supposed to be a TEMPORARY relief that was never meant to replace ALL of people\u2019s incomes forever, but only part of it temporarily. Eventually social security became a permanent controversy of the US.\n\nToday, you and I pay into this program REGARDLESS of whether or not we choose to. If you\u2019re employed and have a job, you pay 6.2% of your income and your employer then matches that 6.2% for a grand total of 12.4% per year in taxes which is why it literally PAYS to have a job. If you\u2019re self employed bum like I am, I get to pay the 12.4% all by myself, because there\u2019s no one to match my contribution. Luckily, this 12.4% has a limit of $137,700 for the year as of 2020.\n\nThe way this program is funded is that all of the social security money goes into one giant pile of money like in a high stakes poker game where everyone chips in. That money is then distributed back to us at retirement age in proportion to the average of 35 of our highest earning working years.\n\nAnd for each dollar we pay in social security taxes, about 85 cents of it goes toward retirees, and the other 15 cents goes towards people with disabilities. \n\nPresident Donald Trump and his administration have wanted permanent tax cuts to payroll as part of the CARES Act for Phase 4. That means companies could get to keep that 6.2% that they pay for employing us. But, because of the illness, many people aren't working therefore the social security program is getting less money. \n\n To make matters worse, in 2019, the program paid one trillion 47 billion dollars out as benefits, but it only received 944.5 billion, so the program is paying out more money than it is collecting. \n\nEither we eliminate some of the benefit that we pay to seniors and disabled people, or we raise the payroll taxes meaning everybody pays more in taxes which, or the most popular solution is we raise the retirement age because people are living longer.\n\nEven if social security runs out of money, remember, it still has enough to pay around 79% of the money that we\u2019re owed in retirement, all the way until 2090. So even though the media tries to scare you and say that we've run out of money, we will technically still be paid, just not as much.\n\nIf you choose to start withdrawing at the age of 62, you will lock in your rate for life - and receive only 70% of the amount you are owed because you chose to withdraw earlier - but contrary to what people think, that income does NOT go up as you get older - it\u2019s locked in once you start collecting. If you can wait till 70 though, you\u2019ll get 132% of social security.\n\nwww.ssa.gov (to check your benefits)\nhttps:\/\/www.ufcu.org\/personal\/learn\/tools-advice\/financial-advice\/be-a-wise-consumer\/social-security-101-the-basics\nhttps:\/\/www.cbpp.org\/research\/social-security\/policy-basics-top-ten-facts-about-social-security?fa=view&id=3261\nhttps:\/\/usafacts.org\/articles\/who-would-be-most-affected-payroll-tax-cuts\/\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Investing 101. How many stocks should you own? Whether you like dividend investing, or you focus on growth stocks, if you own too many stocks then a good performing stock will have very little affect on growing your money because you\u2019ve spread your money way too thin. But if you own just a few stocks, you are taking on a huge risk where you could either make a lot of money, or lose all your money. When it comes to the finance community, this is a fiercely debated question, and no one seems to know the answer.\n\nThe most important variable to answer this question is a word you may have heard before - it\u2019s called - DIVERSIFICATION. It means you take your money, and instead of putting it in one place, you spread it out, across multiple different stocks from different TYPES of sectors, and different types of industries. Doing this means you protect your money from going up and down all at once. It\u2019s important because what it does, is it reduces your risk to the volatility of the stock market. \n\nThe best amount of stocks to own is whatever it takes, to achieve \u201cdiversification\u201d. The problem is, no one can agree as to what that means. Diversification is a sliding scale. In the world of money investing nerds, if you ask them \u201cwhat do you consider diversified\u201d, you\u2019ll very quickly find that there\u2019s many different opinions but the most popular amongst them, is that you should own between 20 to 30 stocks. But is that really fact? \n\nIn 1970, the Journal Of Business published what would become that popular opinion when they discovered that you could essentially recreate the benefits of diversification that you\u2019d get with owning the entire New York Stock Exchange by owning only 32 stocks. That study showed the risk of owning around 30 stocks was low enough to compare to owning the entire New York Stock Exchange. But, that was an old model. Using modern calculations, what they found was that risk reduction, is not necessarily the same as diversification, even though that\u2019s one of the investing benefits.\n\nIn an updated study done by Sur & Price, they used the R Squared formula. \u201cR-squared will give you an estimate of the relationship between movements of a dependent\u00a0variable\u00a0based on an independent variable's movements.\u201d Put simply, If a stock has a LOW R squared result, it means that specific stock,  does not generally follow the stock market\u2019s price performance. A high r squared result, means the stock price generally copies what the overall stock market is doing. \n\nWhen analyzing the stock market, 39% of stocks were unprofitable, 18.5% of stocks lost 75% or MORE, 64% of stocks performed worse than the Russell 3000 index (which is something that tracks the entire US stock market), and 25% of stocks were responsible for all of the stock market's price increases. Think about that for a second, 1\/4 of stocks were responsible for all the price increases.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is that as a beginner, it\u2019s better to own more stocks. In fact, it's better to buy into an exchange traded fund that tracks the overall market like VOO or VTI. With just that one stock, you will own thousands of stocks, in just one piece of stock. As you become better and you can devote more time to this, if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re interested in, then you should own FEWER stocks.\n\nIf you own an ETF that tracks the broad S&P500 stock market, you will outperform the majority of professional stock pickers. For my portfolio, I\u2019ve essentially recreated my own index fund that I have more control over, and it\u2019s a little cheaper, but the downside is that I\u2019m basically doing as good as the stock market, so I might as well own an index at this point if I want a similar result - which is also what I\u2019m focusing more on with stocks like SPHD that are monthly dividend payers.\n\nMaybe you want to take more risk, in which case, you might do better sticking to a stock portfolio of only 10 stocks that are heavily weighted in the tech sector.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/stocks\/11\/illusion-of-diversification.asp#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20five%20stock,is%20actually%20closer%20to%2030\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

It was the year 1762 when we called the rich, \u201cmillionaires\u201d. But can you retire on a Million Dollars?, that\u2019s a question that\u2019s I think on everyone\u2019s mind at some point in life and it's important to understand in the context of investing and passive income.\n\nIf we assume an average income here in the United States of $50,000 a year, working for 40 years starting at the age of 22, and retiring at age 62, the average person will then go on to make around $2,000,000 in his or her lifetime. Obviously we don\u2019t get to keep that whole 2 million, after taxes, we\u2019d keep around $1,691,800 which assumes a best case scenario of no states income taxes if you live in states like Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, New Hampshire, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, or Wyoming.\n\nIf we then take the average savings rate in the United States, which is an embarrassingly low 7.6%, in 40 years, most people will end up saving around $128,576.80 of that 2 million, which seems really low (because it is)\n\nDespite what mainstream media tells us, retiring on a million dollars is very possible, and you can live comfortably without ever running out of money for all eternity and it\u2019s not some magic trick, it\u2019s pure simple math.\n\nFirst, it is true that one million dollars does not have the same purchasing power as it did in 1980. To be able to afford the same amount of stuff with one million dollars today as you did in 1980, you\u2019d need around 3.3 million dollars. So it\u2019s true, as time goes on, inflation makes our money less and less valuable. \n\nFor every dollar in your bank account, it\u2019s worth around 2 pennies less every single year because we\u2019re printing money. With what\u2019s going on today with the economy and because we\u2019ve had to print so much more, inflation can reach as high as 5% or 5 pennies for every dollar that you\u2019d be losing every year. So that\u2019s definitely an issue but not as much as you may think.\n\nIn fact, not only can you retire on a million dollars in your 60s, but theoretically, you can retire on a million dollars at any age, and never run out of money.\n\nIt was a research paper published from Trinity University by three professors. What the trinity study measured, was the success rates of investment portfolios that had different withdrawal rates in retirement for different time periods throughout history between the years 1926 to 1995, which was later expanded to 2009.\n\nThis time period spanned the 2 world wars, the Great Depression of the 1929, high inflation period of 1970s, and the booming 1980s. So this simulation covered a lot of ground. They ran this simulation with 5 different portfolio diversities, 100% stocks, which is what I have with Robinhood, 75% stocks 25% bonds, 50% stocks 50% bonds, 25% stocks 75% bonds, and 100% bonds. They also researched the lengths for 15 years, 20 years, 25 years, and 30 year rolling periods. \n\nThe Trinity Study found that 4% was the magic number. If you retired in your 60s and you withdrew 4%, out of all the simulations that they ran, there was a 100% success rate that your money would outlast you in retirement. So in the case of our hypothetical example of one million dollars, 4% of a million would be exactly $40,000 per year. If you withdraw $40,000 per year, starting at retirement age, there\u2019s a 100% chance your money will outlast you in all the economic simulations.\n\nBut there's a catch, If you increase the amount of years you want to be retiree, then your chances of success will decrease. If you want to be retired for 50 years and withdraw 4% per year, the chance of success drops down to 90%.\n\nTo compensate for that, a safer rate is using a 3.5%, doing this, increases the odds back to 98% success rate (assuming a 100% stock portfolio). In fact, if you withdraw 3.5%, your \"terminal amount\" (the amount you're left with after retirement), would multiply 6 times. That's because compound interest grows your money faster than you can spend it.\n\nhttps:\/\/thepoorswiss.com\/updated-trinity-study\/\nhttps:\/\/jlcollinsnh.com\/2012\/12\/07\/stocks-part-xiii-withdrawal-rates-how-much-can-i-spend-anyway\/\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Dividend Growth Investing, I\u2019m using the Robinhood app but this will work with your favorite brokerage app. I was able to build a small empire of employees that work 24\/7, making me more income. My goal is simple, I want to invest enough money so that I\u2019ll never run out of passive income for the rest of my life and I want to do that all before I hit the age of 35. Anyone can do this once they start, whether you\u2019re on a budget or you\u2019re not.\n\nJust by owning stocks, you get paid. Simple. They literally deposit into your account for holding the stock and you don\u2019t even have to sell it. Why do companies do this? Because they\u2019ve run out of ideas on how to grow, if you gave them more of your hard earned income, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make more with how much they already have. One one hand, that\u2019s not good for growth because it means they won\u2019t be releasing the new Tesla, but on other hand, it\u2019s good because they\u2019re stable, and they pay us a fixed income which is what I\u2019m after. \n\nYou can go to dividend.com and check which companies pay said dividends by typing in their ticker symbol, or you can check in your favorite brokerage app, it\u2019s the ones that have a dividend yield and a number next to them. The higher the yield, there more you earn. But there\u2019s a catch, if you try to only look for high yield companies, you will more than likely end up losing money. I try to aim for 4% per YEAR, anything more than that is cool, but you should be cautious. \n\nSide: In theory, companies can pay this dividend to us forever - without ever running out of money, as long as they are profitable which is how long I like to hold a stock anyway, forever - and I\u2019ll show you my income from that in a moment. But unlike investing in a bond which guarantees to pay back investors money, a dividend is NOT a guarantee, the trade off is that dividends pay more money than bonds, but they come with a higher risk. That\u2019s because dividends are paid at the sole discretion of the board of directors, meaning at any moment, they can stop paying us if they are not profitable. This recently happened to me in June with several companies including Wells Fargo because banks are hurting thanks in large part to zero % interest rates. Just recently, Jerome Powell and the federal reserve told banks not to raise their dividends or buy back their own shares meaning their stock prices shouldn\u2019t be going up anytime soon until things get back to normal which means, if you believe that banks are going to be a big part of our future, they may represent a good value to consider buying.\n\nNormally with dividend growth investing, I try to invest in stocks that are not only paying out dividends and growing them, but also stocks whose share prices are also increasing. I look for dividend increases, dividend payments, and stock growth. In contrast to growth stocks which is only price growth and that\u2019s it. Now once the dividend is paid to us, the stock may fall by the same amount in price, which is usually what ends up happening, and it often times quickly recovers right back up. Sometimes, nothing happens to the price, and other times, the price goes up.\n\nI purchased 3 stocks this past month of June. If you\u2019re on a $100 budget, you can use something called fractional shares and pay as little as $1. Otherwise, I purchased SPHD, MDT, and PM. 50 shares of SPHD at $33.24 ($1,661.43). Love this one because it pays me dividends every single month,, But I also want to look at buying more VYM, lower yield, higher growth - worf it, which is Vanguard\u2019s high yield dividend ETF. That gives me an extra $88.05 per year of income. I also purchased 20 shares of PM at $71.69 ($1,433.80). The third stock I purchased is Medtronic - 17 shares at $91.22 ($1,550.48), dividend safety score of 99, 43 years of consecutive dividend raises, payout ratio only at 65%.\n\nAll of these purchases will add $220.97 to my annual income. I started investing with only $100 at a time, and fractional shares will help you get started. Otherwise, I hope this journey has inspired you to start or continue your own journey to financial independence.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Today, I wanted to reveal something about myself - i've always wanted to do something special when I reach one million subscribers, but I figure - life is too short so I decided to do it sooner.\n\nAt first I thought about traveling to Hawaii, but I did that early last year, then I thought about getting a luxury watch, but most of all, I thought about getting myself a Tesla. Unfortunately, everyone on YouTube already owns a Tesla and I wanted to be different. I've always wanted to own a luxury supercar, specifically - the 2020 McLaren 570s. \n\nThe McLaren is something I've been obsessed about it ever since I was a kid. It has a mid engine V8 3.8 liter, twin TURBO engine. Which will make, 443 foot pounds of torque. That means, it produces - 562 break horsepower. Ultimately, this means, it can do 0-60 in just 2.7 seconds.\n\nI\u2019m ready to share how and why I did it, and how much it cost. When I say afford, I don\u2019t mean, a LITERAL price tag of this car which is a base price of 192,500. When I say \u201cafford\u201d I mean, how much money do you need to invest in something like the stock market to be able to afford something like this?\n\nThe first thing Is to first decide between a lease and a purchase. The benefit to leasing it was that I could let the time value of money make me more money, because instead of paying a large amount up front, I can pay less and invest the difference. Plus, I don\u2019t have to worry about the maintenance as much which for the McLaren is on average - between 3,000 to $15,000 per year.\n\nA standard lease would cost around $7,471 my first month, with a monthly cost thereafter of 2,471. Gas, maintenance and registration not included but I\u2019ll average another $150 on top of that. The other option was to buy it outright with my dividend portfolio. The benefit with doing this way is that I get to own something at the end of my payments that I can sell.\n\nJuddging by the numbers, purchasing it makes more sense, purchasing it means getting a loan for roughly $168,000 at a 2.5% interest rate, and investing whatever money I have left over in the stock market because I can make more than 2.5% per year. So what I\u2019ll do is invest the money left over after the downpayment of 20% which is $41,600,  and with a loan that lasts for 48 months, we\u2019re looking at a final monthly payment of $3,966.00. I didn't say it was a smart financial decision, but I did say to watch the video until the very end.\n\nI didn\u2019t want people to only read the title of the video or just watch a minute of this video and think I did all this because, I didn\u2019t end up buying a McLaren. People talk about \"true cost of ownership\" all the time, but underneath true cost, which is the dollar value, REAL COST is the time value. I want you to think twice when you consider the real cost. \n\nI\u2019m not saying DON\u2019T buy things that make you happy and just forever for no reason. But understand that it\u2019s not OWNING the car that will make you happy, it\u2019s the CHOICE to own the car. I\u2019d you can save enough to say this one phrase, it will change your life forever just as it\u2019s changed mine - \u201cI can buy that.\u201d \n\nInstead, think of everything in terms of .04, or 4%. Take whatever purchase that you think you need, and divide it by .04. In the case of the McLaren, I would need, $741,300, invested at 4%, to be able to have this car exist in my life as a lease option - indefinitely. That\u2019s how much money I need not in the bank, but invested in the stock market, working for me to afford the TRUE cost. If I wanted to buy it, I would need over $200,000 plus, insurance, maintenance, depreciation costs PLUS, the monthly payment of $3,966 (not including maintenance and gas costs), which means I need at least a cool million dollars to afford it passively - that\u2019s the \"real cost\".\n\nContinue being frugal.\n\nSpecial thanks to LVCExotics.com for letting us use their cars (this video was not sponsored by them, but if you're in Las Vegas, tell them Andrei sent you!)\n\nLVCExotics:\nhttps:\/\/lvcexotics.com\/\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Unfortunately, most people don\u2019t quite understand what cryptocurrency is, how it\u2019s used, and why it has value in the first place.\n\nSome of the cryptos I have in my plan to become rich, were a result of chain splits, and they weren\u2019t necessarily coins I bought by choice. A chain split is when you hold a crypto that goes through what\u2019s called a fork, and there are two different types of forks. A soft fork, and a hard fork.\n\nThink of soft forks as software upgrades, while hardforks create TWO separate blockchains, which are created with different rules causing what\u2019s called a chain split into two unique coins. Their total value, is usually the sum of what the original coin was, the value is distributed depending on which chain had the most proof of work.\n\nSo here are my top 10 coins that I hold today.\n\n#10 - DOGECOIN, the goodest of coins. Just kidding, I do NOT own Dogecoin.\n\n#9 - Bitcoin Gold (BTG) - This is one of Bitcoin\u2019s forks. Bitcoin Gold, ticker symbol BTG forked off the original chain because they wanted to change the mining algorithm from SHA256 which is ASIC based. ASICs are argued to be controlled by large corporations, so BTG changed the algorithm to Equihash.\n\n#8 Litecoin (LTC) - If Bitcoin is digital gold, then Litecoin is digital silver. Litecoin is similar to bitcoin but the mining algorithm is different from SHA256. Instead, it runs on something called Script which is simpler. Unlike Bitcoin which has a maximum limit of 21 million coins, Litecoin has a higher limit of 84 million coins. Litecoin is also easier to use as a \u201creal currency\u201d because it can confirm transactions about 4 times quicker than Bitcoin which means more people can use Litecoin to make payments with.\n\n#7 Dash (DASH) - a hybrid of digital and cash to make Dash. It\u2019s another one of Bitcoin\u2019s forks that uses a different mining algorithm to mine the coins. The coolest thing about Dash is its funding model. Dash keeps 10% of its mining profits to upgrading its own network in a democratic voting process, which means it can literally fund it\u2019s own operation and be self sufficient, without being bought by corporate interest. That to me is a very interesting feature that\u2019s worth speculating on.\n\n# 6 Ripple (XRP) - Out of all the coins on this list, the story of Ripple is the most complex and it\u2019s the coin that sees the most amount of real world use by banks. It\u2019s mostly used to transfer huge amounts of money from one bank to another by the banks themselves. If you know anything about derivatives, perhaps we\u2019ll see them on this network. Ripple has a solid chance of becoming a mainstay in the crypto future. My investment in ripple is a hedge, against a hedge if the current banking system wins in this race to creating a global decentralized currency.\n\n#5 IOTA. Really interesting coin (MIOTA) does not use the blockchain like Bitcoin, instead it uses the Tangle. It\u2019s still a proof of concept and it\u2019s not quite as decentralized as it should be. It's quantum computer resistant, and the most futuristic coin on this list. \n\n#4 Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) - another Bitcoin fork, probably my least favorite of all the ones I own because the fate of this coin is too closely tied to the identity of Satoshi, I received this for owning Bitcoin.\n\n#3 Bitcoin Cash (BCH) -  The big players in the crypto space had a disagreement as to what Bitcoin was meant to be, was it a replacement for global currency? Or should it be a store of value like Gold, but digitally? The two sides disagreed and BCH split off. Each of these represents a different solution to the scaling problem.\n\n#2 Bitcoin (BTC) - Don\u2019t ever underestimate the honey badger. I think Bitcoin is here to stay. As the federal reserve continues to print more money, we\u2019ll see Bitcoin as one of the best , if not the best price performing asset in the world.\n\n#1 Ethereum (ETH) - DApps, DAOs, and so much more! Ethereum is my favorite investment on how to become rich with crypto.

In fact, he wasn\u2019t even the guy who came up with the name for the company. Tesla was originally created by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpening in 2003. Elon Musk didn\u2019t actually join Tesla until 2004. The reason he became the face of Tesla even though he wasn\u2019t one of the original founders, is because he was the OG, in the series A funding to get Telsa up and running. He put in $6.35 million dollars of his own money, and took a pretty substantial stock of Tesla along with that investment. Eventually through his leadership, vision, and design, he was able to make Tesla the most valuable car company in the world. \n\nSince then, Tesla has grown to a GIGANTIC valuation. But regardless how great the hype is, you might want to think twice about buying the stock. The question I want to answer is simple, is the stock worth what it\u2019s trading at right now? I don\u2019t think it is, and let me tell you why.\n\nA picture is worth a THOUSAND words. The reason I stay away from Tesla right can be explained with this stock price graph. You know what else looked like it before it lost over 50% of it\u2019s value? Digital currency. The term is called \u201cgoing parabolic\u201d. It means it\u2019s going straight up which is almost always a sign that we\u2019re about to or that we hit the top. Here\u2019s a really simple way of looking at a stock to see whether it\u2019s a good price or not.\n\n It\u2019s known as the price to earnings ratio. What that means is the price that people are willing to pay for a stock in comparison to how much money makes for every dollar in a given year. You can find this P\/E ratio number in your brokerage, like Robinhood or WeBull or Fidelity, Charles Schwabb - or whichever one you use. So for example, if a company has a P\/E ratio of 25, that means people are willing to pay $25, for every $1 of profit that the company makes. So a high P\/E ratio means that the stock is probably overvalued and people have high expectations that it will make a lot of money in the future, and a low P\/E ratio, means the stock could be undervalued because people think the company ISN\u2019T going to make much money in the future. \n\nHistorically speaking, the average P\/E ratio of the stock market has been around 15 or so. Meaning, for every $1 a company makes, people have typically paid around $15 for each stock. So if a company\u2019s EPS or earnings per share is $4, and the P\/E ratio is 15, that stock would be worth around $60. Most investors look for a stock with a P\/E ratio of below 20 when considering which stock to buy. It\u2019s a really quick and easy way to narrow down your options when looking for which stocks to buy.\n\nHowever, P\/E ratios don\u2019t accurately describe everything we\u2019re looking at because it doesn\u2019t take everything into account. A P\/E ratio leaves out the GROWTH rate of a company which is SUPER important when determining the stock price. If you only look at a P\/E ratio below 20 you might mistakenly buy a company that isn't growing. A good \u201cvalue\u201d metric when looking at a stock is a PEG ratio of 1 or preferably lower than 1. Anything more than 1, is getting farther and farther away from \u201cvalue\u201d. In Tesla\u2019s case, its PEG ratio, is actually above 9 - very expensive.\n\nWhen price shopping for a stock you want to buy, try to compare two stocks from two same sector to get a better understanding. Don\u2019t compare Apple to Verizon, they\u2019re different sectors and industries. Try to compare Apple to something like Microsoft maybe, and Verizon to something like AT&T. If we compare the PEG ratio of Tesla which is 9.07 to a competitor in the same industry, Ford for example, which has a 1.72 PEG ratio - that is a huge difference.\n\nRenters losing housing. And most importantly, Papa Powell from the Federal Reserve printing so much money, that the Fed might as well declare an IPO. \n\nFor now, Tesla is overvalued, all things considering in relation to competitors, but the future for Tesla, is still very bright.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

You will own every single publicly traded company from US stocks to International stocks and your money will match what the world is doing. So if you believe the world is going to be a better place 30 years from now, this might be a good option to consider. Since this fund was created, it has returned an average of 5.7% which is good, but not quite as good as the US stock market which has historically done 7%. Pro tip: you can own something like 55% VTI, and 45% VXUS and that\u2019s basically VT but slightly cheaper.\n\n#2 QQQ, a VERY popular investment. Today, the hot sector is technology. This ETF is very tech heavy that follows the NASDAQ. You\u2019ll own more than 100 companies. We\u2019re in the age of technology, and this boom can continue for many decades, or it could end this year. Generally speaking, sector dominance is usually temporary or cyclical. It has a beta at 1.13, which means it\u2019s more volatile than the general stock market.\n\n#3 ARKK, it\u2019s sort of like QQQ, except this is much more aggressive and it\u2019s considered an actively managed ETF which means someone is spending day and night looking for stocks to buy versus just passively following an index. Because of that, you have to the human for doing that at .75% or 75 dollars for every 10,000 you invest here. This fund specifically is run by Cathie Wood who looks specifically at disruptive technologies and tries to outperform the market. In the last year alone, ARK has made 65% returns. The Beta for this is 1.47 which means it\u2019s a little more volatile than your average stock.\n\n#4 VOO, a passive ETF that looks at the 500 biggest companies in the US and that\u2019s what it invests in. There\u2019s not much more to say about it other than its closest sibling would be SDY or SPY. SPY was the FIRST ETF to have ever been created in 1993 and it\u2019s another good option to consider because it\u2019s also got a \"cooler\" ticker symbol which actually may have a positive affect on how it performs according to some studies.\n\n#5 VTI, owning VTI means that every single working person and every single CEO is working super hard to make you money. You can literally walk into any store in America, pick up an item for sale and say \u201cI own this\u201d. But you actually don\u2019t, so don\u2019t do that or you\u2019ll get in trouble. PRO tip: If you buy VOO or VTI consistently, you can set yourself up for the rest of your life. Put in 80% into VTI or VOO, and If you want to \u201csmooth the ride\u201d as JL Collins says, you can add the other 20% into VBTLX for your bonds.\n\n#5 NOBL. If dividend aristocrats can have their own ETF, this is it. In order for a company to be included in this ETF, it has to have increased dividend payments for 25 years or more. It only has a 2.2% dividend yield but with that yield comes a good dividend growth rate of 12% in the last 5 years. With this ETF, you\u2019re going to sacrifice a lot of growth for stability, which for some people is more important than the yield. The expense ratio is very expensive in relation to it\u2019s yield but if you\u2019re older, you may want to consider adding this one.\n\n#4 SCHD, the Charles Schwab US Dividend ETF, with a yield of around 3.44%, super low expense ratio of $6 for every 10,000 invested, it\u2019s cheap to own, and it has grown in value which is what we want to see. It has increased dividends 10% in the last 5 years, and 20% in the last year which is awesome. It pays us quarterly, and, it\u2019s an all around solid dividend ETF.\n\n#3 VIG, the only companies that are in this fund are companies that have increased their dividends for 10 years or more. The dividend yield is pretty small at 1.81% but what it lacks in dividends, it makes up in growth.\n\n#2 VYM, with a current dividend yield of 3.5%, it has returned around 6.7% since it was created, with a super low expense ratio of .06%, it also pays us quarterly from owning 428 stocks, so you will be very diversified. A very good dividend ETF that I\u2019d like to own a lot more of.\n\n#1 SPHD, it has a dividend yield of 5.5%, an expense ratio of .3% (which is expensive) but it pays monthly.

Unfortunately we don\u2019t get to pick our character or stats at the beginning of this game, those will be assigned to us at random. But just like life, you control your character, if you max out all the things you can along the way, while collecting all the items, and if you grind enough, and level up your character, you\u2019ll be able to get through it a lot easier. Let's start at the beginning.\n\nAge 13: You might be wondering How do I invest $100? Here\u2019s the answer, you should invest wherever you get the greatest return on your money. Right now, whether that\u2019s a hundred dollars, or a thousand dollars, investing it in the stock market will not get you the greatest returns. If you tried to invest even $1,000 today, at best you will make a hundred dollars and at worst, you can lose all of it. The returns are not worth the sacrifice just yet. The greatest returns are going to be in developing your character by boosting your stats.  if you don\u2019t have the money, time is another currency in this game of life. You can invest your time or money. Watch as many videos, and pay very close attention to tutorials. This is the age to learn and listen.\n\nAge 14: start to read or you can also watch my YouTube channel, whichever works best for you but the books I recommend are: Simple Path To Wealth by J.L. Collins, I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi, and the third book is The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.\n\nAges 15-17: go on as many side quests as you can. Try swimming, piano lessons, cooking, dancing, drawing, photoshop, photography, and say yes to everything. Through that process, you might find your master skill or \"passion\". This is a missable side quest that most people don\u2019t ever get to do, but if you can do this early, you will get a huge financial advantage especially if it's something society values.\n\nAge 18: we\u2019ve come to the most important level in the game. This is going to set up your play style for the rest of the game and there\u2019s a lot to do here. We need to collect some key items, this is part of the main storyline, so don\u2019t wander off the map. Hopefully by now you\u2019ve collected a bit of money along the way, so it\u2019s logical to do the following. \n\n1. Get a bank account. Ideally you want one with the highest interest rate possible so that while you leave your money here, it\u2019s going to make you money - compound interest style. Avoid account minimums and\/or hidden fees. \n\n2. So get yourself a credit card as soon as possible. I recommend starting with a secured credit card like the Discover It Secured, it\u2019s pretty much the \u201cgold standard\u201d of credit cards to start with if you have no prior history. Pro tip: If you\u2019re a student in college, instead of the Discover It Secured, go with the Discover It Cash Back for students, it\u2019s the same principle but with way better perks. Our goal here is to reach a credit score of 750 and above. This takes about 8 months to 1 year. Make sure to pay down your balance in full each month and never carry a balance (35% of your score), utilize no more than 10% of your monthly spend limit (30% of your score), and do this as soon as possible, this is your length of history (15% of your score).\n\n3. Get yourself either a ROTH IRA , or a traditional IRA. Think of these like savings accounts but instead of keeping cash, it\u2019s mostly for your stocks. These accounts protect your money from paying taxes. Do this as early as possible, it's the most important step.\n\n4. Buy a stock from the stock market or an investment, this one is overwhelming, not only because there are literally thousands of companies to choose from, but because there\u2019s also half a dozen character styles to select from from real estate investor, to dividends, to growth, etc.\n\n5. Build good habits like start tracking your expenses for each dollar you make and spend. Take care of your health to avoid expensive healthcare costs in the future, be frugal and live below your means, and be consistent. That's the secret to success!\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals. I'm part of an affiliate network and I receive compensation from partnering websites.

We are now 18 weeks in a row where jobless claims have totaled more than 1 million people a week. And if you\u2019re one of the 31.8 million Americans that is receiving unemployment benefits, that $600 a week, is going away at the end of this month in July. The two main people between the two sides, for the Democrats - Nancy Pelosi and the Republicans - Steven Mnuchin disagree on what to do about it. Should we extend it so people can keep paying their bills on time or should we reduce it to encourage people to get back to work and give them an incentive?\n\nAll of this created a situation where some people were earning more simply by staying at home. This time around, they want to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen so they\u2019re going to try to implement a system that pays us 70% of our income. \n\nThere\u2019s a few problems though. It\u2019s not 100% clear just yet how much EACH PERSON will receive but the proposed 70% should put the weekly benefit anywhere as low as $100 to as high as $300 per week. The Democrats say they\u2019d rather extend or phase out the $600 slowly over time but it\u2019s not a deal breaker for them if that doesn\u2019t happen. So more than likely we will see both the Senate and The House come to an agreement this week. \n\nThe good news is, the Stimulus check is finally confirmed. More than likely, after both branches negotiate, it will end up being the same $1,200 we've received before. But Now that the Senate has proposed its plan, the house will debate on the 28th which is Tuesday to see what they like and don\u2019t like about the plan. Hopefully they\u2019ll be able to agree on the proposal before August 7th because if not, then it's recess for a month.\n\nOnce they do, If President Donald Trumps signs the bill by August 10th, then the checks will be sent out the week of August 24th. All of this can be done even quicker if nothing changes from the first stimulus payment, that way they can implement the same process with the get my payment tool on the IRS website.\n\nIn addition to the direct payments and the unemployment benefits, here\u2019s a few other things Republicans want to include.\n\n- Republicans want to give $105 billion dollars to help the school systems reopen but they won\u2019t just give money to the schools only to have the schools pay themselves or their lawsuits, the school funds will be dependent on them opening which I think this is a very good idea.\n\n- They will also provide \u201ctargeted\u201d money for the Paycheck Protection Program which is the loan program that gives small businesses money that they don\u2019t have to pay back if they can spend that money meeting certain criteria like paying their employees. The republicans want to include these checks for small businesses that have had their revenues cut 50% or more. \n\n- Republicans also want to give tax credits to companies to incentivize employees to come back to work\n\n- 16 billion dollars for further testing with an additional $9 billion of funds unlocked from the first round.\n\n Just this Saturday the freeze on getting kicked out for not being able to pay rent is over. Approximately 110 Million Americans are renters and it\u2019s estimated that 20% of them are now at risk for being evicted. When this happens, there will be a huge surge of people losing their homes.\n\nCome August, if you can\u2019t pay for all the months you didn\u2019t and catch up, landlords can start the eviction process, and they are legally required to give the renters a 30 days notice. If those renters don\u2019t move out within those 30 days, that\u2019s when they file an eviction complaint in court which won\u2019t be until late August or early September so renters have potentially until then to make more money.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Apple just announced their stock split 4:1, what does this mean for investors and for dividends? First, it means that on August 24th, for each share of Apple stock, you will receive 3 free stocks for Apple. However, the stock price itself will also be reduced in 1\/4ths. Apple does this in order to keep the share price at around $100 to generate more excitement and buzz around the stock itself. It's easier to invest for beginners when they see $100 rather than $400. It's not big news, Apple has done this 4 times before, so if you've ever wanted to start investing, now is a good time to do so. Apple is my favorite stock.\n\nHaving said that, I wanted to take the time to answer a Q&A about money and investing, I hope you like it!\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Maybe it\u2019s an exclusively American goal, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a lot of money, it certainly doesn\u2019t look like a lot of money but if you made $100k a year, here\u2019s what that would look like after taxes \n\nIf you lived in a state with no state taxes, you\u2019d pay $0 and after paying roughly $15,247 for Federal taxes, and $7,650 for FICA, you\u2019d be left with approximately $77,104. Why\u2019s that important?\n\nThe average savings rate if you live here in America is 7.6% which means, most people save only $5,860 out of $77,104. But what this actually means is that at that specific savings rate, you\u2019d need to work for around 60 years to be able to afford retirement.\n\nIf you can save 35% or roughly a third, you\u2019ll be done with needing a job in just 25 years instead of 60. But if you can do 50%, that number drops to just 17 years of work. But the reason six figures is so important to building wealth, is because it\u2019s much easier to reach the ultimate savings rate, which is - 65%. If you can do that, you can be retired in just 10.5 years. So here are the 11 best ways to on how to make six figures a year.\n\n#11 Sales: virtually any sales job that involves commission. If you can knock on 50 - 100 doors a day, you can end up making several hundred thousand dollars a year like some people in their 20s have achieved.\n\n#10 Videographer: I never made close to 100k with this job, but that's because I was doing it wrong. I worked for someone else, to build someone else\u2019s business. But if you can work for yourself, and slowly build a list of clients, you can easily charge anywhere between $1 - $5k for a shoot.\n\n#9 Photographer. Related to videographer but the two are not quite the same. My friend Chelsea from Chelsea Nicole Photography. Photographers in the wedding industry can easily charge between  $8,000 - $15,000 for a wedding gig. There\u2019s no shortage of content here on YouTube that teaches you everything you need to know not only about investing and personal finance, but video editing, and cameras as well.\n\n#8 VFX Artist: This is a true story, my friend Jayce works on every Marvel Movie ever made and many other films where they have \"HUDs\", the heads up displays you see inside of Iron Man\u2019s suit. They actually function with real physics and are practical. Even though, this particular job is known for not paying VFX artists very well, the reason he\u2019s a huge success, is because he separated himself from the rest of his competition by being the best at a very specific niche aspect of an industry and he was able to build a business that makes him multiple six figures.\n\n#7 Club Host \/ Cocktail Waitress - The people who can get this job can make between 200-400 thousand a year. I meet these people from time to time. They are paid by the clubs, the venues, and the highrollers \/ whales they host. \n\n#6 Restaurant Waiters \/ Waitress - If you can get yourself a job at a high end steakhouse, the waiters and waitresses can easily make $100,00 - $120,000 in tips per year.\n\n#5 Butler - For just 8 weeks of training, and only $15,000, you can potentially earn far above $100,000 a year being a butler. Believe it or not, the highest paid butler is in the USA earning 2.2 million dollars a year.\n\n#4 Bartenders - New York City, Vegas, LA, D.C., San Francisco, basically any major US city, and you can easily earn six figures being a bartender with tips alone. \n\n#3 Artist - This can be anything from selling your digital prints, paintings, music or even tutorials on how to do card tricks. The sky is the limit with being an artist and receiving royalties through digital assets and downloads.\n\n#2 Entertainers. This one is similar to artist but an artist can be a digital business, but an entertainer is more of a physical requirement to actually perform for people. Pros: you make a lot of money. Cons: you have to be entertaining.\n\n #1 Social Media \/ Personal Brand - The single best way of making six figures a year is building a personal brand online through social media. There's no limit to how much money you can make and it doesn't cost much to get started.\n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Everyone was expecting the republicans and democrats to come together and help the American people with the second round of stimulus checks. Unfortunately, that did not happen and negotiations fell apart because they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement on the budget. The house democrats wanted to spend 3.4 trillion dollars meanwhile the senate wanted to spend one trillion dollars. Both sides did not back down and nothing productive happened. Cue the 4 new Executive Orders from the President.\n\nExecutive Order #1: This one is called the \u201cMemorandum on Deferring Payroll Tax Obligations in Light of the Ongoing COVID-19 Disaster\u201d.\n\nThe payroll taxes the order is referring to, is the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, which you might know better as FICA which appears on every paycheck we get. This program is responsible for medicare and social security. So If you have a job, and you make $4,000 or less every two weeks, or around $104,000 a year - good news - the normal taxes that we pay, which is 6.2% for Social Security and the 1.45% for Medicare are going away temporarily between September 1st 2020, to December 31st 2020. Unfortunately if you are unemployed, this doesn\u2019t help you in any way because you don\u2019t have payroll to get taxed on.\n\nExecutive Order #2: The second executive order is called Fighting the spread of Covid 19 by Providing Assistance To Renters and Homeowners. This one is pretty vague, and after reading the order myself, I couldn\u2019t see any specifics but here\u2019s what we do know. \n\nThe eviction freeze or \u201cmoratorium\u201d as its called expired at the end of last month in July. So with this new executive order, the president is extending it and providing financial assistance to those in need. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the executive order itself that I read that reveals how long this extension is for, what it actually means to be \u201cin need\u201d, nor how much money will be given as assistance or where it\u2019s going to be coming from.\n\nExecutive Order #3: Instead of the $600 unemployment benefits which expired at the end of July, this is going to replace that one with $400 a week which is exactly in the middle of what the Republicans proposed in the HEALs Act which was $200, and what the Democrats asked for which was an extension of the full $600. This will last until the week of Sunday December 6th, or until the Relief Fund falls to $25 billion dollars which is currently at around $70 billion right now. Whichever is first. \n\nOut of that $400, $100 is going to have to be funded by the states. Unfortunately, not every state will be able to come up with the other $100 because some states are stretched to the limit and their budgets just can\u2019t handle it. For now, you can count on $300 a week, and treat the extra $100 as a bonus if you get it.\n\nExecutive Order #4: The student loan deferment was ending on September 30th, and with this executive order the loans don\u2019t have to be paid back until December 31st, in the meantime, loans will be set to 0% interest rate. But there\u2019s a catch, it doesn\u2019t apply to privately held loans which includes banks. If that\u2019s you, I would still call and ask for any programs they might have available to help you out. \n\nThe bad news is, none of these executive orders address the stimulus check issue which unfortunately the president does not have the authority to create an executive order for. Negotiations should resume today and hopefully come to agreement Tomorrow August 11th, or Wednesday August 12th. \n\nTwo more executive orders place a ban on WeChat and TikTok (details in the video). \n\n*Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Here is my personal list on what I would do with one thousand dollars.\n\n#1: $1,000 is best served for investing in yourself. That means getting a real estate license, learning a trade, or a hard skill - preferably something that does not tie trading your time for making money or a specific location. This could also mean starting your small business\n\n#2: Emergency Fund, make this your priority to save between 3 to 6 months of expenses so you can avoid being one of the 59% of Americans who can\u2019t cover a small $1K emergency expense. The last thing you want to do is use money from your retirement accounts to pay for life\u2019s unexpected surprises.\n\n#3: Pay Off Loans, if you loans are 4% or larger, then you should pay off those loans first - especially if you have credit card loans because those can exceed 19% in comparison to the stock market which will give you around 7 to 8% per year. Investing is a risk, and you\u2019re not guaranteed to make a positive return on money unlike paying off your debt.\n\n#4: Generate Interest. Get yourself a high yield savings account so you can start generating at least 1% interest on your savings account. This is for those who want to put their money to work but don't want to risk it in the stock market (I recommend Ally bank).\n\n#5: Invest Conservatively. You can put your money in a CD, which is a certificate of deposit. It\u2019s an \u201cinvestment\u201d that\u2019s more like a contract between yourself and your bank which asks you to put a certain amount of money away and locks that money in for a certain period of time anywhere between a month to 5 years. You won\u2019t be able to use that money until the contract is fulfilled, which is called the \u201cmaturity date\u201d. An alternative to CDs are bonds. Municipal Bonds is another option which is where the government borrows your money, and this investment is tax free.\n\n#6 Start investing. I prefer the stock market with the following split to get you started. \n\n- $600 VTI \/ VOO (Vanguard Total Stock Market) and (S&P 500), these are nearly identical funds (ideally you should put these in a ROTH IRA account if you haven't already created one)\n- $100 QQQ (Tech heavy ETF)\n-  $100 into the international market ETF which is VXUS. That $100 will let you own the entire international market including emerging markets. \n- $100 VYM (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF). This is my favorite way to save and invest money because this stock pays me money regardless of the share price, and will continue to pay me for the rest of my life (assuming the stock market as a whole is still functional).\n- $100 Individual Stocks. With the remaining $100, you can buy up to 100 stocks and see how you compare against the indexes. It's a fun learning lesson.\n \n#7 529 Account for College: This is a triple tax advantaged account like the HSA.

And when is it going to burst? And should I wait to buy stocks, or should I buy stocks now? The stock market is truly unpredictable, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll try to cover in today\u2019s video. \n\nIf you had your money investing in the stock market, you could have gone to sleep in February and if you slept all the way until the middle of August, when you woke up, you would have barely noticed any difference with regards to what happened to your money despite the stock market crash of 2020. Even though the stock market recovered 34%, you wouldn\u2019t have even known. But the average time that it takes a stock market to recover after a crash, has historically been 4.2 years if averaged out over the span of the stock market\u2019s history. Except, we didn\u2019t do it in 4.2 years - we did it in a lot less. That\u2019s because the stock market is almost at an all time high. In fact, we experienced the shortest bear market and the fastest stock market recovery at a blazing of just 5 months.\n\nSo here\u2019s what happened to my dividend investing stock portfolio. Based on my income from last year in July, I was paid $484.07. In the ideal world, my income would grow by at least 6% per year assuming that I just reinvest my income. Except this month, according to my Robinhood statements, I earned $456.84. That\u2019s $27.23 cents less which also represents an income loss of 5.6%, so literally a decrease in the opposite direction. A $27.23 is thankfully not that much money, so I will live, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m diversified across many sectors and many stocks which is how I designed it to be but I\u2019m still curious - why did that happen? \n\nThe issue behind some of the income cut was because of Wells Fargo who cut their dividend by a massive 80%. Instead of earning 51 cents a share, in September, I will be paid closer to 10 cents a share. Also in August, this month, BP, a stock I held quite lot of, decreased their dividend in HALF. So instead of earning 63 cents a share, I will now earn 31 cents a share in September. That decrease will cost me $87 a year. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but if you have couple of those throughout the year, and it can add up to several hundred dollars a year. \n\nThe lesson here is to remember: don\u2019t put all your money into just a few stocks, especially concentrated around one sector (even if it\u2019s tech). Despite my income being LOWER for the first time ever, the portfolio itself, the overall value, is almost at an all time high. My income has decreased, but the value has increased. Why is that? This is really interesting. The tech sector right now, represents 33% of the S&P500. The 5 biggest holdings of the stock market right now are Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft.  Just those 5 companies alone, make up about 22% of the entire index because they performed so well. Naturally, when companies do really well, those indexes increase their holdings for those companies. \n\nIn addition to tech outperforming everything else, the Federal Reserve has pumped several trillion dollars into the system. We have more liquidity, there\u2019s a lot more money to go around and it\u2019s a lot cheaper for companies to borrow that money to grow their operations. Also, since the pandemic started, analysts predicted earnings to be bad so they set extremely low expectations. But after we saw some of the earnings reports beat those expectations, the stocks climbed even higher. Add the occasional retail investor and that\u2019s the receipt for unprecedented growth.\n\nMy overall conclusion is that this year, more than likely, we will finish strong. It won\u2019t be until next year after the election, when we will see another shakeup. Until then, as long as the Fed support is strong, real estate, stocks, and the overall economy won\u2019t budge much lower. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

What would you do with all that money? How would you invest it? Would you invest in real estate? Stocks? How much would you pay in taxes? I've put together this general guide on how I would invest several million dollars if I inherited a large sum of money.\n\nIn 2003 the Redditor\u2019s grandfather put his college fund into Apple stock, that year, apple closed at around $1.50, and right now it\u2019s obviously several hundred dollars per share, several million dollars in appreciation, that means you\u2019re going to have to pay quite a lot in taxes right? Interestingly enough, you will not because The Step Up In Basis. With this rule, you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on the difference between what the real cost basis was, and what you inherited it at which then becomes your new cost basis. When you inherit the money, you are also automatically given the long term capitals gains tax rate.\n\nHypothetically, if you decide to sell the stock the moment of passing, assuming zero price growth, you will pay minimal taxes on from sale. However, if you wait to sell the stocks and they appreciate in value, then you have to pay long term capital gains taxes. You would pay 0% on your first $40k, 15% for $41k to $441,450, and 20% for anything above that (depending on your taxable income). You don't personally need to know this tax information, but when you hire a CPA and an estate and trust attorney (VERY important), these are great talking points to discuss.\n\nAfter inheriting the money, I would first sell those shares because you should never risk that much money in any single company, no matter how great it is (even though AAPL is my favorite stock). Now that I have 3 million in cash, here's how I would invest it.\n\nFirst, I would pay off my debts. Credit card loans, student loans, auto loans, personal loans, etc. I wouldn't necessarily pay off my house unless my mortgage was in excess of 4%. Otherwise, I would continue investing in the market. \n\nSecond, put that money in a high yield savings account that generates some interest so you don't lose money to inflation. Make sure not to exceed the FDIC limit of $250,000. You'll need to manage multiple accounts but it's worth it if you want to minimize your risk. If you want to have that money invested soon, you can keep it in a single bank account short term but be careful not to let any single brokerage account exceed $500,000 in stocks because that goes over the SIPC limit (500k stock + $250k cash). \n\nThird, I would put 30% (roughly $1 million)  into a low cost dividend ETF like VYM which generates around 3.6% dividend yield (at this current moment) which will give you a base income of $36,000. From this moment forward, you will almost certainly never drop below this income and you've secured a middle class lifestyle without needing an actual job. Not bad! \n\nFourth, I would put another 30% (another $1 million) into either a growth ETF like QQQ or even better, a broad market ETF like VTI which tracks the total US stock market. Chances are 30 years from now, you'll be in a better position than you are today. If you can hold off on needing this money, consider putting this in a retirement account. Make sure to ask your financial planners about the backdoor Roth IRA, or the mega backdoor Roth IRA options just in case.\n\nFifth, I would put another million dollars into real estate. If you like passive real estate investing, considering downloading Fundrise and using that app to do the investing for you, I highly recommend them. If you like slightly more active real estate investing, I'd buy REIT ETFs \/ individual stocks. Lastly, if you like very active real estate investing, buy physical properties and turn them into rentals for extra cash flow.\n\nSixth, I would save 10% of your money as cash to ride out bad economic conditions so you don't have to sell your house or your stocks. Give some to charity or your parents, and you're set for life.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

That actually sounds way more dramatic than it is, in reality, the two sides cannot agree on two simple things. Funding for the state and local governments, and overall budget for the stimulus package. \n\nWhile both the house of representatives and the senate agree on the $1200 stimulus checks, they have not both approved of any bills that give us our second stimulus. So what's the latest status on the stimulus check and are we still getting it? \n\nDemocrats proposed the Heroes Act which was passed only by the House of Representatives on May 12. That one included $3 trillion dollars worth of stimulus money. It also included a budget for $413 billion dollars as a direct payment to the American people for the $1,200 stimulus checks for anyone making less than $75,000. That budget was much more money than the original CARES Act which cost only $293 billion for the stimulus checks. The reason for that is because people received $500 for their dependents from the CARES act , whereas the HEROES Act, was going to give another $1,200 for each qualifying dependent.\n\nThe Republicans rejected the idea and the Senate responded with their own bill. On July 24th, they came up with the Health Economic Assistance Liability Protection and Schools or the HEALS Act. This was a complete 180 from the democratic HEROES Act because instead of spending $3 trillion, this proposal called for $1 trillion. It focused more on funding the reopening of schools, and helping hospitals. It also called for the reduction of the $600 unemployment benefit down to $200. However, the heals proposals did call for $1,200 stimulus checks in their budget for people with the same income limitations of less than 75,000. They both agreed on a direct payment so where did it go wrong?\n\nTwo main reasons. Funding for the state and local governments because the Heals Act did not want to give money to the states, while the HEROES Act did - it called for $1 trillion dollars in help. The second difference, is the foreclosures and evictions which the Cares Act did more to stop by extending the freeze on evictions for another year, while the heals act wanted to let the protections expire.\n\nThat brings us to today. The focus is less about helping the American people directly, and more about the US. Postal Service which will play a key role on November 3rd - the Presidential election. Recently, Louis Dejoy has been at the center of criticism from both democrats and republicans. Since taking the job on June 15th, he made some big changes. Some of these changes are reducing overtime hours for employees and arguably one of the more important changes - is getting rid of the postal sorting machines. Because of this struggle for power, the attention for the stimulus checks has temporarily been taken away by the focus on the election.\n\nTwo new bills were put forward. For the Democrats, the bill would give the US postal service $25 billion dollars in funding. But more importantly, the bill prevents the postal service from making major changes that would affect election results.\n\nFor the senate, the proposal is called Delivering Immediate Relief to America\u2019s Families, Schools and Small Businesses Act, also called the \u201cskinny version of the stimulus bill\u201d. It asks for the $600 a week unemployment benefit to be cut down to $300 until December 27, it gives liability protections to businesses and healthcare providers, $100 billion for education, $10 billion to help the US postal service, and $45 billion to the department of health and human services.\n\nIf there was a bill that included the stimulus checks that passes, it will most likely be for $1,200. The earliest it would be sent is either the week of September 21st, or the week of September 28th. On the low end, $1,200, on the high end, it would be a $6,000 payment. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.vote.org\/early-voting-calendar\/\nDelivering for America: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3aPN2Pn\nCheck Schedule: https:\/\/cnet.co\/3hlq5Gc\nCalculator: https:\/\/wapo.st\/32fMaj7\n\nLinks above include affiliate commission or referrals.

This is how I made money using the airbnb app. After quitting my job, I had no supplemental income so I was forced to learn a new skill that taught me how to pay my bills. This is everything I learned in two years as an airbnb superhost. \n\nUltimately this is what allowed me to quit my job and take a risk by starting my channel here on Youtube. Without this income, I wouldn't have been able to pay my bills, I hope this guide is helpful for you. Unlike stocks, dividends, and robinhood, this specific investment is one of my best investments I've ever made. \n\nHere are some optimized pro tips for how to make money online and offline using the app.\n\n1. Airbnb does not have to be expensive. I started by buying a steel frame for my bed which cost around $100. I also purchased a queen size mattress for around $200 from Amazon. I decided to decorate my place by making it bright and inviting so I bought a teal rug, used my old desk, and purchased a futton which doubled as a full\/queen size bed. Total cost to set up was $650.\n\n2. If you're going to make money with airbnb, you should be able to host at least 4 people. If you can, host 6 people and you will have far more people book your place. People like to travel in groups and split the cost. It's common practice for the airbnb host to charge extra for each guest after the first 2. These are some of my favorite bookings and you can easily make upwards of $300+ a night (especially on weekends).\n\n3. Make your profile picture family friendly. It's important to let the guest know you are there to provide a place to comfortable place to stay that's safe. If you come across as a \"bachelor\", you will lose a large portion of clientele on airbnb. \n\n4. Prioritize these 3 factors. Location, safety, and cleanliness, these are the top 3 things people value the most. Sell your listing by telling guests proximity to grocery stores, bus stops, tourist attractions, etc. People like walkable locations. Emphasize privacy and safety by giving your guests their own key to lock their space so that they feel comfortable leaving their valuables. Keep your place clean and take bright photos! \n\n5. When it comes to advertising your space and getting your first booking, price your listing competitively and undercut the market. This will allow you to build the first few reviews and then you can charge more. It also helps to take nice pictures with a wide angle lens. If you don't have anything on hand, borrow an iPhone 11 and take pictures with that. For extra credit, make a short video. After your place gets booked and your guests arrive, it's great to show them a handbook that shows them your favorite hotspots such as restaurants, attractions, things to do and see, etc.\n\n6. If you have a larger budget, focus on automation. You can automate from locks, to writing up reviews, lights, etc. If you do this right, you can make it so you never have to meet your guests making this a 100% passive income investment. \n\n7. Please check city zoning rules and regulations. This is especially true if you want to convert spaces into full time airbnb such as a garage space. Your house has to meet certain criteria in accordance to city regulations and HOA rules. If you google your city + airbnb zoning, you will most likely find a website that shows you where you can and can't have 30 day short term rentals. Unfortunately, there is no universal website I've been able to find that shows it for each state\/city.\n\n8. Don't get discouraged if you have a bad first experience like I did, keep with it and you will quickly be able to more than just your mortgage, and you'll eventually start earning $100 a day and more.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

The best passive income investments are ones that pay you for life without ever working or needing a job. When thinking of my income, I don't think of my true income as money I earn from my job; instead, it's the income I make while I sleep that I count as true income. \n\n\"What's the best investment money can buy?\". \"It depends on your financial goals\". That never made any sense to me, how can my goals be any different than yours? Isn't the goal to make as much money as possible and be rich? Don't we all want to know how to be a millionaire? It turns out, the answer is not so black white. With that said, this is my attempt at answering that question for my younger self. Here are the top 5 passive income investments of all time.\n\n#5 \"Alternative Investments\". Let's start with one that you should avoid. Many people seem to think these are good investments but they aren't. They include collectibles, coins, art, watches, etc. These investments don't pay us passive income and involve a degree of luck beyond our control so because of that, it gets a 2\/10 for the money factor. It's easy to invest and buy for anyone around the world so it earns a high score of 8\/10 (easy). Investing here to protect yourself isn't very safe however, you risk damages, loss or theft, and your investment losing value. The safety score is 5\/10. For taxes, it's taxed a long term capitals gains rate of 28% so it gets a 4\/10 for a grand total of 18\/40. \n\n#4 P2P Lending which is where you loan money to people and small businesses that were not able to get approved on loans from traditional banks. These investments are higher risk because the borrowers usually have lower credit scores. The return rate on your money is about 4-7% so I will give a solid 5\/10 to both the return and risk because you can essentially pick and choose which way you want to go with both. Be careful doing this because it\u2019s an 8\/10 for difficulty meaning anyone can get started but you may never get your money back if someone defaults on their loan. Taxes are based on your income tax bracket which isn\u2019t as good as long term capitals gains so I\u2019ll give it a 5\/10 for a grand total of (23\/40).\n\n#3 Royalties. I make around $100 a month in royalties from courses I put together since high school. The sky is the limit so the money factor is high 8\/10. However, it's difficult and not everyone can make a product people will want to buy so the it gets a 5\/10 for difficulty (moderate level). Since you\u2019re investing in yourself essentially, I think the risk is low so I\u2019ll give it a high score of 8\/10. Taxes for royalties are taxed on Schedule C under ordinary income rates so I\u2019ll give it a 5\/10. Bringing the total to 26\/40.\n\n#2 Stock Market Investing, specifically, buying dividend stocks to generate passive income. This is my all time favorite passive investment. I make around $7,500 to $8,000 a year from this one and the potential for money is an easy 8\/10.\n\n#1 Real Estate investing. If you want to make the most amount of money, as quickly as possible, with the most flexibility and balance, then real estate is the go to asset. You can buy $100 worth of real estate with only $20 down, so your money goes much farther than anywhere else giving it an 8\/10. Unfortunately, it\u2019s difficult. Dividends are much easier to start with and it takes a pretty big learning curve and much more money to start doing this. On the difficulty level - 6\/10.  If you can master it though, real estate can be a protection against inflation at the worst case scenario, so it\u2019s just about as safe as a stable blue chip stock so we\u2019ll also give it an 8\/10. When it comes to taxes, you can write off just about everything when it comes to real estate. Property taxes, mortgage interest, etc. giving this a 10\/10 bringing the total score to 32\/40.\n\nHonorable mentions I didn\u2019t include are CDs, bonds, high yield savings accounts but I don\u2019t consider them \u201cinvestments\u201d as much as just places to hold your money so it doesn\u2019t lose value.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Out of all the countries in the world, the United States happens to have the most millionaires by far. \n\nIn order to be considered part of the 1% of US earners, you\u2019d need to make roughly $400,000 per year in income. That number actually varies state to state, for example here in Las Vegas, Nevada, you\u2019d need to make roughly $469,328 to be considered 1%, while if you\u2019re in New York City, you need to make $702,559. What\u2019s crazy to me though, is that the President of the most powerful country in the world, the United States, takes a salary of only $400,000 per year. While that\u2019s still a lot of money, it\u2019s far below what some people make from their jobs. All of these following 8 jobs can make well above $400k a year and into the legendary 7 digit million dollar figure. \n\n#1:  Healthcare jobs: anesthesiologists, plastic surgeons, cardiologists, and neurosurgeons. If you can stomach the work, the grueling hours, and the emotional effects of how important your job is to saving someone\u2019s life, you can earn an annual salary of $400k to $500k and up. The downside is that you need 13 years of studying after high school. The average debt that these professions hold is anywhere between $200,000 to $300,000. \n\n#2 Tech. The average salaries here are easily six figures. Even a software engineer intern at Google makes over $7,000 a month starting pay. The big salaries belong to the senior software developers that work for FANG. Facebook, Apple, Amazon , Netflix and Google. If you\u2019re a tech lead, you can make over half a million dollars a year and more after bonuses and incentives. This was my first choice when I was considering a job. The downside to this job isn\u2019t the education or the cost, instead, it's a just you cannot learn unless you have some basic interest in doing so. You can\u2019t force yourself to learn coding, you need to have a drive and passion for it.\n\n#3 Finance. Specifically, an investment banker. If you watched my video about the stock market where I talked to Raoul Paul, that's the guy that pulls in well over a million dollars a year at the height of his career. If you\u2019re really smart about it, you can be a managing director making well over a million dollars in bonuses alone in about 10 years. Three years as an analyst, three years as an associate, 3 years as a VP, and another year or so as an executive director. That\u2019s the best case scenario, according to efinancialcareers.com. The average time it takes to become MD is 17.5 years. \n\n#4 Law. There are lots of different flavors of lawyer to choose from. If you do a quick google search you\u2019ll see the highest paid ones by salary are corporate lawyers, tax attorneys, trial attorneys, IP attorneys and medical lawyers. But in my opinion, one of the highest paid specialty lawyers are class action lawyers. The average debt here is $145,000 and it's an extremely high stress career with very high rewards.\n\n#5 Consulting. I got to consult on Now You See Me 2 and spend two months with the cast and train them how to do cardistry. Probably one of the coolest life experiences ever and consulting contracts can easily be well over a million dollars.\n\n#6 Day Trader. While not exactly a position that you apply for, it does closely relate to a hedge fund manager. Except in this case, instead working for a banking giant, you\u2019re working for yourself.\n\n #7 Realtor \/ Real Estate Investing. Two ways you can go about this one, you can either leverage your money by buying houses, renting them out, and selling them for a profit or you can become a luxury real estate agent and become a millionaire. Best examples are Graham Stephan and Meet Kevin.\n\n#8 Social Media person. Whether it\u2019s instagram, Facebook, or YouTube, you can make over a million dollars a year making videos from the comfort of your own home.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Tesla has been on a massive rally since our last video 6 months ago and Jeremy's Tesla stock has grown tremendously in value.\n\nAs a passive dividend income investor using Robinhood, I don't own any amount of the hyper volatile Tesla stock but I wanted to speak with Jeremy to get his thoughts on the current Tesla price and if it's worth investing in. Here are some of the investing for beginner questions we'll answer today.\n\n- When did you buy Tesla and at what price point?\n\n- How did you know back then that it would be a great company to invest in long term?\n\n- How has the stock split affected the price, do you think that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing? \n\n- Sometimes a company buys back it\u2019s own stock, but is it good or bad when a company sells it\u2019s own stock? Tesla just announced they were going to sell 5 billion dollars worth of their own stock. Is that a good thing or a bad thing for shareholders? \n\n- Will Tesla be included into the S&P500? What do they need to do to get there, and how will that affect the price?\n\n- Is Tesla a buy, hold, or sell, and what should people do with their Tesla stock? \n\n- Do you see companies like Ford or maybe Toyota eventually surpassing Tesla in the electric race? And I\u2019ll follow that up with my own question, how far ahead is Tesla of the competition?\n\n- Why I don't personally invest in Tesla and what it would take for me to do it.","publishedAt":"2020-09-02T22:00:01Z","tags":["tesla","tesla stock","buying tesla stock","passive income","passive income ideas","how to invest","investing for beginners","saving","how to save","money saving tips","Robinhood","dividend","dividends","dividend investing","stock market","how to be a millionaire","stocks for beginners","robinhood app","invest","stocks","andrei jikh","credit cards","how to invest in stocks","real estate","investing in your 20s","$100 a day"],"title":"Buying $300,000 Of Tesla Stock - WORTH IT?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xPWByfpEVpM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xPWByfpEVpM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xPWByfpEVpM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xPWByfpEVpM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xPWByfpEVpM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2028","dislikeCount":"206","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8122","viewCount":"182193"}},{"id":"P8Nl6_HUTQ0","snippet":{"description":"Robinhood is being investigated by the SEC in a Civil Fraud Investigation that could total $10 million dollars\n\n\u25ba My Stock Portfolio + Stock Tracker: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/andreijikh\n\u25ba Get 1 Free Stock on WeBull (Valued up to $1600 when you deposit $100): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/kol-us\/share.html?hl=en&inviteCode=QhhB1aDNwEDP\n\u25ba ROBINHOOD Free Stock: https:\/\/robinhood.c3me6x.net\/c\/1980551\/671816\/10402\n\u25ba Open A Roth IRA: https:\/\/m1finance.8bxp97.net\/c\/1980551\/696710\/10646\n\u25ba FREE Discord: https:\/\/discord.gg\/Hff86m9\n\u25ba Follow Me On Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/andreijikh\/\n\nAccording to Wall Street Journal, \"Robinhood Markets Inc. faces a civil fraud investigation over its early failure to fully disclose its practice of selling clients orders to high speed trading firms.\u201d Here's what that means in plain english. \n\nWhen Robinhood launched in 2013,  it changed the way people in their 20s invest, including myself. There were no such thing as buying and selling stocks without paying a commission. That left a lot of people wondering how exactly was this new unheard of app called Robinhood making its money? If you went to their website, they wrote a page called \u201cHow Robinhood Makes Money\".\n\nThere were two main ways that were listed:  #1: the interest that their brokerage collected from all the money that you and I deposit in the app and #2 they made money from the fees from margin trading accounts. \n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Margin Trading,  it\u2019s when you buy and sell stocks with \u201cleveraged money\u201d or money you don\u2019t actually have but money that you borrow and is considered \u201ccollateralized\u201d which means, if you lose money on margin, not only do you lose your borrowed money, you also are forced to sell any stocks and cash you had in your brokerage to pay for those losses, and this strategy is a very risky way of investing. It turns out, Robinhood had a third way they made money that was not disclosed to investors. #3 Payment for order flow.\n\nRobinhood does not execute its own trades like some brokers do, it outsources them to someone else. Market makers are usually very large companies that provide liquidity to the market. That\u2019s because Robinhood doesn\u2019t actually sell or buy us the stocks we want to invest in, all they do, is match a buyer with a seller. That order then goes to a market maker which is the actual company that holds the stocks, which then sells it to the client. The difference in price for what the market maker sells and buys the stock for, is called the bid and ask spread. They make fractions of a penny per share.\n\nThe reason these middle man are important to trading is a few reasons. They provide liquidity which means we can invest in stocks instantly without having to wait, we can invest in stocks at a more accurate price point, and they (the market makers) take all the risk for holding on to the stock while they wait for the orders. \n\nRobinhood has been receiving payments from these market makers for routing our trades to them. There's nothing illegal in this practice. In 2018, Robinhood made half of its profit from these rebates. In 2020 they made $126 million from Citadel Securities, $75 million from Susquehanna,  $37 million from Wolverine, $20 million from Virtu, $9.7 million from Two Sigma, and $1.6 million from Morgan Stanley.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with what they did, is not telling you and I about how they made their money before we placed our trades because it creates a potential conflict of interest. Now, they are now in a civil fraud investigation by the SEC. Ultimately, this doesn\u2019t affect us much. Especially if you\u2019re someone who\u2019s a long term investor, in the grand scheme of things, over paying by 1\/8th\u2019s of a penny per share isn\u2019t going to make any difference to how your money grows if you're investing for retirement. \n\n If you\u2019re super concerned still, a good solution is just to set a limit order for what you think the stock is worth and for what you want to buy it at, and the problem is solved.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

People want to save their money rather than invest it, but is that really the best decision? That depends on where the economy and the stock market is going. One way to look at what the future may bring is something called the Velocity Of Money.\n\nIt measures how quickly money has been trading hands and for each dollar that\u2019s printed and injected into our economy, exactly how much value we create in return over a given period of time. Look shows us right now, we are at an all time low for the velocity of money. That means people right now are NOT exchanging money as much as we\u2019d like. When they aren\u2019t trading money and spending it, we get a potential deflationary collapse. That means all asset prices like stocks and houses fall or \u201cdeflate\u201d because there is a demand to save dollars which means relative to everything else, the dollar is going up in value because people are going to want more of them. To prevent this from happening, the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve a 2% per year inflation rate to keep asset prices growing.\n\nUnfortunately, no one knows whether we\u2019re going to see inflation first and then deflation. Or the other way around, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. That makes it really hard to figure out how much to save vs invest because people get really scared and it makes them want to wait until we see what happens. But that\u2019s not the best thing you can do right now, you should not wait, here\u2019s a really perfect study case of why you don\u2019t want to do that.\n\nConsider 3 investors with the same strategy. Each started with $99,000 over the course of 41 years, they bought stocks, reinvested dividends, and never sold the stocks. When they weren\u2019t buying stocks, they held their money in a savings account that gave them 3% returns per year. \n\nCase Study #1: Tiffany, she saved her money until the day of the worst stock market crashes in history. She purchased at the top in 1987 losing (-33%), 1990 (-19.7%), 2002 (-49%), 2009 (-56.5%), and 2020 (-34.1%). After 41 years, the total value of her investments ended at $773,358. Not bad considering she bought at the worst possible times.\n\nCase Study #2: Brittany, is the opposite of Tiffany. She\u2019s a genius. She invested all of her saved money exactly at the bottom of the market. She predicted this 5 times in a row (virtually impossible). She bought all those stocks at a discount and her $99,000 ended up being worth $1,123,573. While that\u2019s a lot of money, notice it\u2019s not a huge difference between the best market timer, and the worst market timer. Why is that?\n\nCase Study #3: Sarah, who didn\u2019t buy at the market top or the bottom. She ignored all the noise, unsubscribed from every finance YouTuber, and invested $200 every single month into VTI or VOO starting in 1979 (even though those ETFs\/Indexes didn't exist at that point). She ended up with the most in her brokerage account, exactly $1,620,708. This is because she didn't wait to start, and she let compound interest do the work for her much earlier than everyone else while getting the standard average returns in the stock market.\n\nCase Study #4: Negative Nancy, she saved for 41 years in a high yield savings account at 3% because she was afraid of investing. She just left it in there for 41 years. In total, she ended up with only $332,000. \n\nAs far as how much you should invest, it's easy to figure out. It\u2019s, it\u2019s your annual expenses times 25 invested at 4% and that\u2019s your goal if you can maintain the same level of lifestyle. Once you save 25x your annual spending, that 4% will equal to exactly 1 year of annual income in perpetuity.\n\nThe lesson here is never try to time the market, continue saving and more importantly, consistently investing instead of timing the market. \n\nLinks to resources:\n\nVelocity of Money: https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/M2V\nThank you to Reddit Personal Finance: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/iq30q8\/timing_the_market_absolute_worst_vs_absolute_best\/\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

That's a question I had not too long ago. When it comes to investing for passive income, it's not only about investing your money, but also your time. So is college worth it? Especially for my guest who is a 23 year old millionaire. He accumulated a net worth of 30 million dollars.\n\nHow did he do it? Was the success of his millions a result of his hard work? Or was it all luck? Most of us pursue wealth working hard, saving our income, and investing in something like a roth IRA or a 401k, or even in a taxable brokerage account with an app like Robinhood to retire with passive income. But what if you already had the end result of wealth? What if you had all the time in the world? I wish I knew how to invest both my time and my money in my 20s better than I did, but nothing prepared me for what my college guest had to tell me about his wealth and net worth.\n\n *None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

It\u2019s made up of 25 Republicans and 25 Democrats, so exactly split down the middle to bring balance to the force, this is the way. These people are considered \u201ccentrists\u201d or \u201cmoderates\u201d so they get along with everybody and if this bill doesn\u2019t get congress back to the table to negotiate so we can finally get another stimulus check, then most likely nothing will work after this point before the presidential election. \n\nAs of right now it is endorsed by over 75% of the PSC, the problem solvers caucus of 50 members. The best part about this bill in my opinion is that it\u2019s flexible with what happens after this point. It will use \u201ceconomic metrics\u201d like infection rates and hospitalization to see whether we should decrease spending, or if it gets worse, we can increase it. If it gets worse, this proposal will drop to 1.3 trillion, and if it gets worse, it will be boosted to around $2 trillion.\n\n$316 Billion Support For Individuals and Families, this is where the stimulus checks will be. This includes the $1,200 direct stimulus checks, plus an additional $500 per child + dependent adults and it\u2019s retroactive. It also provides rental assistance for the most needy which it doesn\u2019t clarify exactly who qualifies or fits that definition, and extends the eviction moratorium all the way until January 2021. If you\u2019re a student with loans, the student loan forbearance will be extended to December 31st, 2020. \n\nIf you\u2019re unemployed, this is very important. They\u2019re offering $450 a week for for the first 8 weeks, then give $600 a week but capped at 100% of your income. So if your income was $20k a year let\u2019s say, you won\u2019t receive more than that in compensation. It\u2019s capped at whatever you were making prior to being laid off. \n\nOther important news this week:\n\n- OPEC just reduced their expectations for oil demand this year and next year, and BP, another stock I own said that demand for oil will probably peak this decade. If you're a dividend investor in energy stocks, this could be writing on the wall.\n\n- Nikola Stock, one of the alternative companies to Electric cars has been accused of committing fraud. Nikola said it was anticipating a savings of 4 billion dollars in battery and powertrain costs over 10 years, and over 1 billion in engineering and validation costs\u201d. However, they showed a video of their Nikola Truck that was just rolling down hill, implying a working product when it wasn't.\n\n- If Joe Biden wins the election, you won\u2019t see that much change with your taxes, but if your annual income is $400,000 or more, which is $33,333.33 a month, you might be paying more in taxes under his tax plan. In a study done by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, 80% of the increases in taxes will fall on the richest 1%. Mr. Biden wants to increase taxes on capital gains for those making over a million dollars a year from 23.8% to 40%. The president wants to reduce it to 15%. \n\n- Apple just announced the a brand new Apple Watch Series 6, the Apple Watch SE, an 8th Gen iPad, a new iPad Air, and iOS14 which will go live today. They\u2019re using their market dominance to stop promoting services that compete with their own services and instead promote Apple. Spotify is trying to raise concerns over potential monopolistic practices.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Enter ESG. It stands for environmental, social, and governance integration. Those are some really big words, but it\u2019s really easy to understand.\n\nWhen we invest, the goal is to combine the normal methods of value investing while also keeping in mind the ESG rating of which there are 3 major ones. There\u2019s something called laggard which is CCC or B rated, and it means it\u2019s lagging the industry because it\u2019s careless about almost all aspects of ethics with corporate profits being the #1 priority. Next up at #2 is \u201cAverage\u201d rated from double B, triple B, and A. This means it\u2019s kind of unexceptional - A rating is on the higher end of that spectrum. Lastly there are the \u201cleaders\u201d of the industry, companies that are rated double A or triple A, and they are very socially aware of their affects on the world.\n\nHere\u2019s how the rating works. For example, E stands for Environmental, which looks for how the company affects the earth. The research involves climate change policy, greenhouse gas emissions, carbon footprint, water related goals, renewable energy incorporation, recycling and safe practices, how good their relationship with the EPA is, and of course how transparent and open the company is about sharing this information with us. \n\nS stands for social which is more geared toward employees and their overall culture. How it treats people, how much it pays, the benefits, the turnover rates, the diversity of the people they hire ethnically speaking, if there\u2019s a mission for a higher purpose than just making money. For example, Elon Musk and Tesla want to help humanity travel farther and more sustainably. \n\nThe G stands for corporate governance which is how the company treats long term business growth, vs short term, if executives get what\u2019s called the golden parachute which is a massive multimillion dollar bonus for retiring from the company, whether chairman and CEO are separate roles meaning shareholder value is sometimes more important than the company goal and their relationship with the SEC. \n\nESG is a pretty diverse model to judge a company\u2019s ethics, and of course no company is perfect. It's impossible to know for sure which company to invest in specifically because it's difficult to guess which technology will shape the future. But I did promise a stock and there is one stock that I like. It\u2019s an ETF with the ticker symbol - ESGV.\n\nESGV is Vanguard\u2019s exchange traded fund that tracks small, medium, and large sized companies using the ESG criteria. It excludes companies that doesn\u2019t follow those guidelines. Specifically it does not include stocks or companies in adult entertainment, alcohol, tobacco, weapons, fossil fuels, gambling, and nuclear energy. But it has some great companies, most of which I own because the top 10 holdings of this ETF are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla, Visa, Protecter and Gamble, Mastercard, Nvidia, and Home Depot.\n\nCompared to the golden standard of index investing which is stock ticker symbol VTI, it\u2019s performing better than VTI this year. In the last year, VTI has increased 14.73%, meanwhile, ESGV has increased 20.36%. By owning one share of ESGV, you would own 1,478 stocks. Both VTI and ESGV have an identical ESG rating of A.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

You might have heard of these people, I\u2019m one of them, and I want you to be as well. There\u2019s 3 main levels of fire. LeanFire, Fire, and FatFire. \n\nLeanFire is where you save 25 times what you spend in a year, which is when you\u2019re considered LeanFire. That means if you spend, $20,000 a year, you\u2019d save $500,000, and if you withdraw your savings at 4% while it\u2019s invested in the stock market, the idea is that you\u2019ll make $20,000 a year, without ever running out of money, therefore, you are considered \u201cretired\u201d. The goal, is to do this, as soon as possible in your life.\n\nOnce you achieve it, you can cruise around in your awesome Tesla and do whatever you want. Unfortunately, you probably can\u2019t afford a Tesla on just LeanFIRE alone, you have to go to the next level.\n\nFIRE, this is when you spend about what the average US household income which is around 60k a year. To make 60k a year, you need to save 1.5 million dollars and have a withdrawal rate of 4% to live the average lifestyle of 60k per year. But even at that level, you still can\u2019t afford to own this car based on the fat fire 1\/10 car buying rule.\n\nTo afford that Tesla, you need to aim for FatFire which starts at an above average income of 100k. To make a 100k a year passively, the FatFire movement says you need to save and invest 2.5 million dollars.\n\nThe price of the Model Y in the video, out the door is $59,900, which when invested in the S&P500 for the duration of your working career which is on average anywhere 40 years. If you took that money and invested it at just 7% per year average return, at the end of your 40 year career, you would have $896,970.02. This is FIRE territory for most people.\n\nIf you don't make 10x what your Tesla costs, then here are some cars to consider in relationship to your income level.\n\n$25,000 - $50,000 a year - you\u2019re looking at roughly 10+ year old cars that are worth anywhere between $2.5k to $5k. I like to call this the Scotty Kilmer range, that\u2019s your beat up Toyotas, and Hondas.\n\n$100,000 - $200,000 a year - get yourself a newer reliable Japanese car. Toyota Yaris, Kia Rio, Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, Hyundai Kona if you\u2019re a family person, maybe a Toyota Prius if you can keep it under $20k, Hyundai Elantra, we got a used 2017 Toyota Corolla. Not the best option but they\u2019re all reliable, they look decent, and they get you there.\n\n$200,000 - $250,000 a year - this is still not the income level where you buy Mercedes and BMWs, here you can get something like the Ford Fusion, the Toyota Camry, the Honda Civic Sports versions. Something a little bit more fun and speedy like the Volkswagen Golf, maybe a hybrid option. Anything $25,000 and under.\n\n$250,000 - $500,000 a year - this is where the luxury income bracket starts. Here you can get yourself anything between 25k to 50k, this is the Mercedes C-Class, Lexus ES, Audi TT, Toyota Supra, BMWs, 1s, 3s, 5s, and Tesla Model 3 and the Model Y non performance editions.\n\n500k to $1,000,000 a year - you still technically shouldn\u2019t be buying Ferraris and Lamborghinis. This is the income bracket of certain models of Maseratis, used Bentleys, Porsche 911s, and all of the Tesla Models with the exception of the Tesla Roadster. You can go for a used Ferrari or Lamborghini here, but you shouldn\u2019t be buying them new here, even if you make half a million a year. That belongs in the next bracket.\n\n$1,500,000 and above is about where it starts for the Ferrari, the Lamborghini, and the McLaren, that\u2019s this income level. Which isn\u2019t to say if you make this much you should be buying that. 1.5 million will get you cars valued at $150,000 or 10% of 1.5 million.\n\nIf your net worth is above a couple hundred thousand dollars (half a million is a good start), you can convert the 1\/10th rule to 5% of your net worth. So if you have a million dollar net worth, you can buy a car valued up to $50,000.\n\nThat brings me to this Model Y and why you probably can\u2019t afford it, it would take roughly $600,000 dollars a year to afford this car, which most Tesla drivers are probably not making. Or you could go with the 5% net worth rule, which means the specific Model Y in the video, I would need to have a net worth of $1.2 million dollars. That\u2019s a lot of money. Do you have that much to waste?","publishedAt":"2020-09-21T22:15:05Z","tags":["tesla model y","tesla","tesla review","before buying a car","tesla model 3 performance","tesla model s","new vs used car","buy vs lease car","buy or lease a car","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","tesla stock","model 3 review","model 3 vs model s","how i bought a tesla","financing a car","how to buy a car","stock market investing for beginners","passive income","how to invest for beginners"],"title":"Watch This BEFORE You Buy A Car!

First, let's start with the 4 major reasons dividends are the best ways to start investing - especially for beginners. \n\nReason #1 - Superior Returns\nThe Hartford Study showed that dividends have historically played a pretty significant portion of the stock market\u2019s return in the last century. The last 50 years of data shows that dividends people received and then reinvested back into the stock market have been responsible for 78% of the total stock market return. If we want to go back even farther than 50 years to 1930, giving us a lot more data to look at, in that time period, dividends were responsible for almost half of the returns at 42%.\n\nReason #2 - Longevity \nMoney that\u2019s been invested in the stock market has returned anywhere between 8% to 9%. Just because the stock market has though, doesn\u2019t mean real people have, and the reason for that is because people get scared, they panic, they try to time the market, and they sell their stocks at a loss. According to the BlackRock Investment firm, the average investor made only 2.1% in the last 20 or so years which is barely above inflation. Being a dividend investor, gives you the staying power to actually make those 9% returns.\n\nReason #3 - Safety\nI don't have to time the market to enjoy a good retirement like what happened to people in 2008 when they lost their IRAs and 401ks. I can focus more on cash flow and not worry about my stock values are day to day.\n\nReason #4 - Peace of Mind\nAs the stock price falls, the dividend yield increases, and vice versa. So I will be paid based on my initial investment. So if I bought $100 of Coca Cola and it was giving me 4% per year, which is $4 a year, it will continue paying that even if the stock fell to $50, it will still give me $4 a year.  It\u2019s a good feeling to know that I\u2019m still making money that at any time, I can use to pay my bills. It\u2019s cold hard cash, and it\u2019s all the proof that I need that the company is making money. \n\nHere are some bad reasons to being a dividend investor for passive income.\n\nReason #1 - Dividends are not guaranteed. In 2020, there we dozens of companies that cut their dividends. It\u2019s not a contract between us and a company that we will be paid dividends. At any moment, companies can hugely decrease their dividend payout or even worse, completely get rid of of the dividend and there is nothing we can do about it. \n\nReason #2 \nDividends limit total returns because, when a company is paying out a dividend, it's another way of saying they have run out of ideas to grow. It might be also signal a declining company. Because it\u2019s no longer growing, the stock price tends to increase less than that of growth stocks. Reason \n\nReason#3\nDividends are not free and you will pay more in taxes. When a company pays out money, the stock price drops by the same amount. You\u2019re just taking money from one place, and putting it somewhere else. Like a transfer from your savings account, to your checking account. Dividends you receive are taxed, so you\u2019re forced to pay capital gains taxes on dividends where in contrast, growth stocks don\u2019t pay out so there\u2019s no forced withdrawal, so you don\u2019t get hit with taxes.\n\n Reason #4\nIt decreases diversification. If you\u2019re investing in dividend stocks, that means you\u2019re only investing in large established companies, otherwise known as \u201clarge cap\u201d stocks. But you\u2019re missing out on the new up and coming companies that have the potential to be the next Tesla - the small cap companies. \n\nReason #5\nDividends are only advantageous emotionally, and nothing else. They don\u2019t provide any real benefit over growth investing other than making you sleep well at night. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.hartfordfunds.com\/dam\/en\/docs\/pub\/whitepapers\/WP106.pdf \nhttps:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/why-dividend-stocks-are-popular-again-11551669121\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd #270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nGraham Stephan recently made a video about him buying a bank which was the Yotta Savings app. I want to tell everything you need to know about it:\n\nCURRENT SAVINGS YIELD:\nBase rate of 0.2% with an effective 1.8% to 2% yield after prizes are taken into account.\n\nWHAT IT IS: \nIt's an app that works like a high yield savings account that pays a baseline interest yield of 0.2% which is very low - so how is that good when the national average is three times higher at about 0.6%? That\u2019s because, the real effective savings rate of this bank, is closer to 1.8% to 2%. The answer is - Prized Linked Savings. It\u2019s basically a free lottery system - just like the United Kingdom\u2019s bond program. Here\u2019s the breakdown of how it works.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\nThere\u2019s two ways to receive a lottery tickets. The first method is written in their official rules. If you send in a physically written letter with your name, your email, your mailing address and your phone number to their address (45 East 22nd St. # 26B New York, NY 10010):  you will receive one free ticket. You are limited to one letter and one free ticket.\n\nFor every $25 you deposit into this savings account, you get a \u201crecurring ticket\u201d into weekly number draws. What that means is that if you deposit $100 for example, you will get 4 weekly lottery tickets that run every single week without expiring, so you don\u2019t actually need to keep making $25 deposits to keep the same tickets you already have. The maximum amount of tickets is 10,000 tickets per person with a value of $250,000 (The FDIC Insurance limit).\n\nThen once a week, every Monday, you get to pick what you think the winning lottery numbers will be. Every single night at 9pm Eastern time, each number is revealed and displayed in the homepage of the app. On the last day, on Sunday, the red ball or the \u201cYotta\u201d number is drawn and the prize money is calculated (every prize above $1000 will be split if multiple people win the same tier).\n\nWHAT THE PRIZES & ODDS OF WINNING ARE:\nTesla for the second prize, and $10,000,000 (ten million) for the grand prize. More info here: https:\/\/www.withyotta.com\/official-rules\n\nHOW DOES IT MAKE MONEY?\nRight now, Yotta Savings is not profitable. It uses the interest on savings account to pay out prizes. They are using investor money to pay for operations. In the future, they'll probably offer credit cards and other banking services. \n\nWHAT I LIKE: \n- The high yield interest rate (with an ever higher upside)\n- A way to play the lottery without actually spending money on lottery tickets\n- Very solid team running the company and reputable investors\n\nWHAT I DON'T LIKE:\n- Limit of 6x withdrawals per month (standard, probably for regulatory reasons but hopefully they can increase this in the future)\n- Limit of withdrawal and\/or deposit of $10,000 per day (this needs to be increased in the future)\n- Sneaky marketing (they can increase the amount of lottery balls to pick from therefore decreasing the odds of winning the prizes, which will contribute to a lower effective yield. They can do this without \"officially\" saying they have decreased their interest yield because they can keep the base rate at 0.2% - very smart, but sneaky. We will see how they handle rate decreases in the future but giving them the benefit of the doubt for now)\n\nTHE HISTORY:\nThe United Kingdom has a program called the Premium Bond Program. It\u2019s run by the government, and the way it works is people get to win prizes instead of generating interest on their savings and the success of that program was so huge that it became the #1 savings program in the entire country. Over 23 million people have over $100 billion dollars deposited in that program.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

This is what I did after I quit my job to survive and grow my business into a multiple six figure business. Hope this helps you! Here are the 7 steps.\n\nStep #1:  Claim money that is owed to you. This tip is worth the entire reason for clicking this video. The government might owe you money and you have no idea about it. Whether it's a credit card you overpaid, a utility bill, a bank account you closed, money that is yours must be reported by law, to the unclaimed property department of the US government. You can check this database by entering your name and state to see if you're owed money: www.missingmoney.com\n\nAlso check the department of labor, if the company you worked or work for broke labor laws or you\u2019re owed back pay. The Department of Labor holds your money for up to 3 years. Go to pbgc.gov\/search-unclaimed-pensions\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, third place to look is insurance money for which there are 2 major categories. The veterans life insurance funds from: insurance.va.gov\/UnclaimedFunds\n\nAnother place to check is from the FHA mortgage, so if you own a house, and you pay your mortgage, you could be owed a refund from HUD - the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The website for that is entp.hud.gov\/dsrs\/refunds\/\n\nCheck tax refunds directly from the IRS website as well: irs.gov\/refunds\nIf your bank has failed, go check here if you can claim money: http:\/\/closedbanks.fdic.gov\/funds\/\n\nIf your credit union has failed, go here to check if you're owed money: https:\/\/www.ncua.gov\/support-services\/conservatorships-liquidations\/unclaimed-deposits\/unclaimed-deposits-listing\n\nIf your brokerage like Robinhood has failed, go here to start the claim process: https:\/\/www.sipc.org\/cases-and-claims\/\n\nIf your bonds have stopped paying interest and have matured, you may be owed money: http:\/\/treasuryhunt.gov\/\n\nFor all other claims, here is the consolidated page directly from the US Government website: usa.gov\n\nStep #2 So now that you\u2019ve hopefully got some money to start with, the second thing that\u2019s absolutely free, is to start selling - how to make money online courses - just kidding. Start reselling on ebay, Offer Up, and Craigslist. You\u2019ll be surprised how much money you can raise from old stuff that\u2019s laying around.\n\nStep #3 Start to make $100 a day. I like to think of money like water, it can be ice or it can be a gas - it has different states. Money is like that too, it can be passive income, or it can be active income. You can make money sleeping, or you can make money working, or you can turn it into time. We need to buy you some time. So get yourself an internet connection. It\u2019s free. If you go to a public library, a friend\u2019s house, or if you have no friends (forever alone) go to a coffee shop, you\u2019ll find free internet. Then, start to rent a room out at your place, or call a friend and offer them a portion of your income for borrowing their space. The video is here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iVshpgUzHoc\n\nStep #4 Start Freelancing. In 2017, I was 100% jobless with no future, not unlike still today. I started to leverage my skill in entertainment to get high end clients paying me $2k per hour, which sounds impossible right? Actually corporate clients need to use their budgets every quarter so as not to be given a smaller budget next year - knowing that, I knew they needed somewhere to spend the excess capital. Why not me pay me to entertain them? \n\nStep #5 Learn video production. That\u2019s how I got booked. Whether you\u2019re a magician, a photographer, a DJ, an accountant, a real estate investor - does not matter. YouTube teaches everything you need to know with regards to being a content creator for free. Take advantage of this!\n\nStep #6 Social media \/ Content Creator. Assuming , you can write, and maybe you have a smartphone that can record videos. You don\u2019t have to be a personality to do this. In fact, you don\u2019t need even need to be on camera to do this, it costs zero dollars.\n\nStep #7 Crowdfunding on Kickstarter which is a fundraising platform that allows you to present your idea to the world, and if people like it, they buy into it, giving you the actual money to realize your vision whether that\u2019s a product, service, or a show!","publishedAt":"2020-10-02T22:30:38Z","tags":["how to make money","passive income","how to start a business","how to invest","how to start investing","how to start with no money","investing with no money","dividend investing","dividends","robinhood","dividend income","dividend","stock market","how to be a millionaire","stocks to buy","best investment","investing for beginners","stocks for beginners","robinhood app","how to","stocks","andrei jikh","Passive income","credit cards","how to invest money","How to invest in the stock market"],"title":"How To Start Investing With $0 (My 7 Steps)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KGnNKnLL_b0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KGnNKnLL_b0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KGnNKnLL_b0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KGnNKnLL_b0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KGnNKnLL_b0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1595","dislikeCount":"165","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"9687","viewCount":"181270"}},{"id":"iBcRD_DsFG8","snippet":{"description":"Important information about the stock market during elections that you need to know right now\n\nStock Market - What You NEED To Know Right Now\n\u25ba My Stock Portfolio + Stock Tracker: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/andreijikh\n\u25ba Get 1 Free Stock on WeBull (Valued up to $1600 when you deposit $100): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/kol-us\/share.html?hl=en&inviteCode=QhhB1aDNwEDP\n\u25ba ROBINHOOD Free Stock: https:\/\/robinhood.c3me6x.net\/c\/1980551\/671816\/10402\n\u25ba Open A Roth IRA: https:\/\/m1finance.8bxp97.net\/c\/1980551\/696710\/10646\n\u25ba FREE Discord: https:\/\/discord.gg\/Hff86m9\n\u25ba Follow Me On Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/andreijikh\/\n\nMy PO Box: \nAndrei Jikh\n4132 S. Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103 \n\nWhat's going on with the stock market as we approach elections? Some very interesting things start to happen that investors need to be aware of as we go forward and approach November 3. Whether you use Robinhood or another brokerage, if you're a dividend investor collecting passive income or not, this is important. Volatility is increasing and the stock market is about to go on a rollercoaster ride. Here are 3 reasons why:\n\nReason 1: Elections. In September, the S&P500 fell 3.7% but we are still up 9% in the third quarter of 2020 and overall for the whole year, we\u2019re up 5%. People tend to think that if the current president remains in office that it will be better for the stock market because of loose regulations on corporations and taxes. Meanwhile, people think the democratic nominee would increase taxes on corporations and the wealthy. But if we look at historical data, elections actually play a lot less of an important role in the stock market. Since 1977 the economic growth rate average has been around 2.7% for the Republicans, and 2.9% for the Democrats. So actually, it\u2019s about the same regardless of which party comes into office. \n\nReason 2: The stock market sees volatility because we had the President get the covid diagnosis. This unexpected announcement introduced more political uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen to the stock market, but now that he\u2019s out of the hospital, positive news, the stock market should go up.\n\nAccording to US Bank, data as far back as 1933 shows that regardless of who becomes President, Republican or Democrat, the stock market tends to underperform the following year, with bonds increasing a little more in price than stocks. When a new party takes power, the stock market goes up by about 5% the following year. But if the current president gets reelected, the stock market on average has increased slightly more at 6.5%.\n\n If the current president gets reelected, stock market analysts show that following the year of a midterm reelection, the stock market has consistently outperformed the year before it. So whatever we finish this year at, if the President is re-elected, the stock market should do as well as, if not better in 2021 than we have in 2020 which so far is up by 5%.\n\nReason 3: The mysterious NASDAQ whale pushing up tech prices yet again. His name is Masayoshi Son. He\u2019s the CEO of Softbank. Back in September nobody knew what was causing the stock market to behave the way that it was, but low and behold, we found Mr. Son to be the man behind buying call options for tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Tesla. Call options are when people buy contracts betting that a specific stock will go up in price. If you do this with enough money, it forces people to buy those stocks to cover their stock positions driving the price of the stock even higher. It\u2019s a positive feedback loop that just keeps on going. Between April and September, doing this exact trading strategy, he is thought to have pushed up the NASDAQ index by as much as 60%. \n\nSo as far as volatility is concerned as we head into elections, here is what I'm doing. I'm saving a cash position to take advantage of any volatility which should peak 1 week before elections. The time period between Monday October 5th, to Monday October 12th, as well as the middle of this week due to the Stimulus Bill is crucial. Be on the lookout. If you're thinking of sitting it out, consider this fact: going back to 1930, if you missed the S&P 500's 10 best trading days in the last 87 years, your returns would have been 97%, but if you had stayed in the market, you would have made 14,962% returns, just something to think about if you were considering pulling your money out and waiting on the sidelines.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

How much money is considered rich in America? Let's discuss what it means for your money if we get Joe Biden as president, and what would happen if we kept our current president. This is something that wasn\u2019t really talked about much in the debates, but it\u2019s an issue that affects all of us, no matter how much money we make.\n\nThe democratic nominee (Joe Biden) has made it very clear that if you earn $400,000 per year, you are rich. Technically speaking, you are not the 1% yet, instead - that would put you in the richest 1.8% of earning households. However, to Joe Biden\u2019s point, that group of people in the 1.8%, make up 25% of the entirety of money that is made in the United States. To be considered in the top 1% nationally, the true rich category, you\u2019d need to make $515,000 a year.\n\nPros for your money if we get a democratic President in 2021:\nHere is the good news. Joe Biden wants to help people that are buying a home for the first time. Under Joe Biden, people would get a $15,000 tax credit for buying their first home. While this sounds great, something people may not realize is that it would also increase the price of real estate across the board meaning you would also take on more debt and pay more over the course of your life.\n\nIf you are a parent and you have kids, great news, the current CTC, child care tax credit is capped at $2,000. Joe Biden proposes the child care tax credit to be increased to $3,600 or $300 a month for each child ages 5 and under, and $3,000 for kids 6 and over but under age 17 as long as the pandemic lasts. \n\nPlus he wants to offer a refundable tax credit for health insurance premiums which is money we pay for our health insurance every month. \n\nIf you are a student, very good news, if your household makes less than $125,000 per year, Mr. Biden wants to let you go to a public university for free for 4 years.\n\nHere are the negatives for your money:\nHe wants to increase taxes on 3 major aspects, individual income, payroll taxes and capitals gains taxes. For 98% of people, taxes will not increase as far as money you earn from your job. For people earning more than $400k per year, taxes could go back up to 39.6%. If you make less than that, your income taxes will not increase. The second category is payroll taxes. If you make more than 400k, you will pay an additional 12.4% in social security payroll taxes.\n\nAccording to research from the taxfoundation.org - payroll taxes are paid almost entirely by you - the employee. That\u2019s because tax burdens are determined by the market through a concept called \u201crelative price elasticities\u201d. The market decides via supply and demand. Turns out, there is a lot more supply of people wanting a job, then there is a demand to hire those people wanting that job. So when governments increase payroll taxes, corporations have to react, and they do that by adjusting how much they pay us. Technically speaking, the cost of payroll gets passed on to us as an invisible tax in the form of - decreased wages. \n\nIf you\u2019re an investor in the stock market under Joe Biden\u2019s tax plan, corporate taxes will increase from 21% to 28% which means less money that corporations get to keep to pay to shareholders or reinvest back into their growth. This affects everyone that has a 401k, an IRA, and is invested in the stock market.\n\nThis is money you make when you sell your stocks or get paid dividends. Mr. Joe Biden wants to take away the tax structure on investments and instead tax them exactly the same as you would get taxed on your income but only for people making $1 million a year or more. \n\nLastly, he wants to get rid of the step up in basis which is how parents pass on their assets to their children.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103 \n\nRobinhood, the app that brought us the ability to buy and sell stocks for free, one of my favorite brokerages is having people report their funds stolen from the app. In this video I want to show you exactly what's going on and how to protect yourself. \n\nFirst, investor emails are compromised, whether that\u2019s through a third party service, or website, or some google chrome extension they downloaded. Step 2, The attacker will at this point usually either delete the email you receive from Robinhood and\/or mark it as spam so it goes directly into your spam folder where you will not get notifications from future emails. This is important for step # 3 which is when they go to the Robinhood website, type in your email address and reset your password. However, since it\u2019s in the spam folder you will have no knowledge of this happening.\n\n If your 2 Factor Authentication protection is enabled, 1 of 2 things will happen. First thing that can happen is your phone gets a text with the 6 digits to confirm your login, at this point you should be safe unless your phone was also compromised and they have access to your SIM card via something called a sim swap. The second thing that could happen is you get a notification on your phone that either Authy or Google Authenticator has your 6 digit code. So if you use 2FA with Google Authenticator, the attacker should not be able to access your Robinhood account, unless they physically have your phone and password. \n\nHere's how you can check if you've been affected. Open Robinhood and go to the little person icon on the bottom right again, click on Statements & History and here it will show you the recent history of your account. Click show more and it will show you everything including options, interest payments, dividends, and stocks you should have received if you invited friends, but more importantly, your stock orders and transfers. If you notice anything strange like a transfer you didn\u2019t make, or a stock sale you didn\u2019t authorize, then that\u2019s a good indicator your account may have been compromised. Make sure to scroll through all of it to double check. \n \nIf you were affected, here's what to do. First, get in touch with their support team at robinhood.com\/contact , or you can go inside the app in the bottom right hand corner, just click the little person icon, and all the way at the bottom you\u2019ll see help, click on that, click contact us, my account & login, then the second to last option should say my account was compromised and at the bottom a little button will appear that shows \u201cContinue To Agent\u201d.\n\nSecondly, enable 2 Factor Authentication in the app. Here\u2019s how you can do this: go to the person icon on the bottom right and here you will see Two Factor Authentication - enable that right away. Make sure to use the Google Authenticator method instead of SMS. Download Google Authenticator and follow the instructions. Once it's complete, you should see codes refresh every 30 seconds as a verification method for logging in. This will make your account much more secure. \n\nTo prevent getting in trouble with a SIM Swap, the best thing you can do is contact your phone service provider company (preferably email) and let them know that you want a note left in your account. The email should read something along the lines of , \"Any SIM card orders to be shipped to my address can only be requested in person. I must physically be present at a store location to pick up said SIM card. No SIM cards can be shipped to me even if I request it over the phone or online\". This way, if something were to happen, you have paper trail evidence and your phone company should now be liable for making you whole again.\n\nGet into the habit of doing this for every single thing that\u2019s sensitive - your banks, bro your credit card accounts, and brokerages. If you have to 2FA enabled and you use the SMS like I was, please do this immediately.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103 \n\nI just broke a passive income record last month. In this video I want to share my income, how much my money has grown, and I\u2019ll include price ratings for your consideration to figure out how to invest if you're unsure where to start investing as a beginner.\n\nDividend investing is the road to getting rich slowly. The longer you are in the stock market with dividend stocks, the more your income grows over time. But it grows fast, here's an example: if I were to do nothing from this point on, and I stopped reinvesting my income, based on my growth over the last 5 years which has been 5.4%, in 5 years time, my income will be around $11,346 dollars. In 10 years, it will be nearly $15,000. In 20 years, it will be $25,000. That\u2019s not counting for inflation which is 2% per year but my income still tripled in 20 years and I did nothing to work for it. But if you can continue investing at the rate that I was when I was earning $50,000 a year, which is when I was putting away $2,000 a month, then in 20 years, you would end up with $1.2 million dollars, which would pay you $111,000 a year.\n\nI assumed a starting amount of $200,000 which is where I\u2019m roughly at right now, with 5.5% annual dividend increases with an annual yield of 4% per year, and stock appreciation at only 2% per year for a total of a 7.74% annual return. Think of it like rolling a snowball down a hill, the first part is really hard, but once it grows to a certain size, it picks up and the dividends grow much faster the larger they get until the interest they pay you is more money than you can afford to contribute yourself from your active income.\n\nNow this is where my mind gets blown. At my current plan, I want to have a million dollar dividend portfolio by next year in 2021, if I do, I will have an annual income of $40,604, but I won\u2019t quit making YouTube videos, and if I continue to reinvest those $40,000 every year for the next 15 years, then by the time I\u2019m in my mid 40s, which is still a super young age, then I will have a portfolio worth nearly $4,000,000 paying me 360,000 a year, which is 30,000 thousand dollars a month. That\u2019s the power of dividend investing. \n\nThis brings the monthly total to a record high of $917 for September's Dividend income. That\u2019s almost $1k for the month of September which is crazy to think that your money can earn money. If you can do this consistently, you are literally putting your money to work for you and the growth it generates is called compound interest. The idea is that these stocks will pay you either every month, every 3 months, twice a year, or yearly as long as the company is profitable and making money for hopefully the rest of your life giving you the freedom to travel the world, live your life, while you collect passive income with no job and no one to answer to but yourself.\n\nThe advantage to dividend investing versus investing in growth stock companies - is that in an economy that is flat or going down, you are able to take your dividend income and reinvest it, to give you more shares while decreasing your cost basis and increasing your equity versus someone who holds on to a growth stock that might be just going up and down but ultimately going nowhere in that same amount of time. The downside, is that you pay more in taxes slightly over time so there are advantages to both. There's a strong argument to be made for index fund investing to have better returns than dividend investors but this is my personal favorite way of building wealth for passive income.","publishedAt":"2020-10-16T21:59:31Z","tags":["passive income","make money online","how to make passive income","passive income 2020","robinhood","investing for beginners","stock market","stocks to buy now","real estate"],"title":"I Broke A Passive Income Record (Dividend Income)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6x6yM2SqLhA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6x6yM2SqLhA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6x6yM2SqLhA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6x6yM2SqLhA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6x6yM2SqLhA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M52S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2609","dislikeCount":"176","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"15937","viewCount":"242271"}},{"id":"zeaVOxBfuJ0","snippet":{"description":"How much house can I afford?

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103 \n\nHow much house can I afford to buy? That's a very good question that has several different answers. The median household income in 2019 was the highest it\u2019s ever been at $68,703. The most recent home prices data shows that in the second quarter of 2020, the median purchase price for a home was $313,200. That means people are spending roughly 4.5 times their yearly income on a home which is just about at the top of affordability scale. So the value of homes has been increasing faster and faster. There\u2019s 2 major reasons for it.\n\nThe first reason is the supply. The last time we\u2019ve had this low of an amount of homes for sale was in 2003. The second reason is because how low our interest rates are. They are lower than the real estate crash of 2008. In the last 50 years interest rates have been going lower. Now everyone can afford to buy more house. But how much money should you spend on a home and how much can you afford? There's 2 main answers:\n\nFirst, take your monthly income, and multiply it by 0.28. Using myself as an example, I was making $50,000 a year before YouTube, that equates to about $4,167 a month. I would take that and multiply it by 0.28 which gives me roughly $1,167 a month. As long as my monthly payment doesn\u2019t exceed that amount, I should be able to afford a house that falls within that range. That happens to be around 5x my yearly salary for a total home price of $250,000. If you want to have a higher chance of getting approved for a loan, the payment for your house, including your total debt - should not be more than 36%. This is called the DTI (debt to income ratio). Add up all the debts, including the mortgage, and divide it by your gross income. If the result is 36% or less, you should be able to get a loan.\n\nThe second method for calculating affordability is different than the first. This one uses the 3\/30\/10 rule for all the personal finance investor enthusiasts. You have to follow all three rules and if you cannot, you have to follow at least 1, otherwise you shouldn\u2019t be buying the house even if you can technically afford it, you\u2019re increasing your risk which is especially bad in times of uncertainty. \n\nRule #1 is 3. That means you should not be spending more than 3 times your annual income. So if you make $100k per year, in theory, you should not spend more than $300k on your home. I realize that this rule is extremely hard to follow if you\u2019re living in a high cost of living area like San Francisco or New York City. In some cities across the US, buying a house for 3 to 5 times your annual income is impossible at this point. \n\nRule #2 states should have at least 30% of the home purchase price in cash. All this rule does, is lower our payment and tempt us away from selling if our homes lose value. That means to set aside at least 20% as a downpayment so you can get rid of the PMI which is called private mortgage insurance. This is something our lender forces us to buy into to protect their money from the risk of us defaulting or foreclosing - and for all intents and purposes - it\u2019s literally throwing money away. You should also save the other 10% for random costs like repairs.\n\nRule #3 states you should spend no more than 10% of your gross income, that\u2019s income before you pay your taxes on a mortgage. For the average person, it\u2019s recommended to be around 28% but if your monthly payment can stay under 10% then you\u2019re going to save and retire a lot faster. There\u2019s really only 3 ways you\u2019ll be able to do this. Either make a lot more money than the average person or buy a lot less house. Or you can do what I did and just rent a part of your house.\n\nThe perfect mortgage size for people to get into if you can afford it is $750,000. That\u2019s because of something called the HMID - the home mortgage interest deduction which allows us to  itemize and deduct mortgage interest paid on up to $750,000 worth of principal, on either our first and\/or second home. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103 \n\nFord and GM are the two oldest car companies in the world dating back to 1903 and 1908 and yet - Tesla\u2019s stock market cap is worth more than both of them combined a couple times over.\n\nGM is investing  $2.2 billion dollars into creating 20 new electric cars by 2023. And GM, specifically the Hummer has a massive customer base because of how long they\u2019ve been around as well as the off-roading capabilities that they're known for. Tesla and the cyber truck has yet to prove that. In just one hour, GM filled all their preorders on the limited edition supertruck. \n\nDespite this, Tesla\u2019s infrastructure with it\u2019s factories and superchargers around the world is at least 2-3 years ahead of everyone in the EV game. Looking at the specs the fastest Hummer EV will go 0 to 60 in 3 seconds, while the tri-motor Tesla Cybertruck will get there a tenth of a second quicker. They both have autonomous driving and GM has what\u2019s called Supercruise. The cyber truck is going to have a 6.5 foot bed versus the GMCs 5ft bed. Big difference. \n\nAs far as the most important metric, the range of the hummer is topped out at 350 miles, meanwhile the cyber truck will top out at 500 miles, that is a massive difference in range. Tesla\u2019s cybertruck (tri motor) will cost $77,900 fully maxed out and the Hummer will be $112,595. That may not sound like much, but that\u2019s a difference of $34,696: which means you can have a maxed out Cybertruck plus a base Model 3 for the same price of GM\u2019s Hummer. \n\nAs far as which stock is better to invest in, Tesla or GM? Long story short, GM is highly undervalued at the current moment with a fair value target of $50 per share which it\u2019s currently trading way below that. That\u2019s because GM is not very popular, they\u2019re not a tech company, they\u2019ve gone through a major bankruptcy and investors are very slow to trust it but by the numbers, their stock is worth less than what it\u2019s currently operating at in terms of profitability. \n\nFor Tesla, the estimated fair price target to be $319 a share so hugely overvalued from where it\u2019s at right now. Which is not to say don\u2019t invest in Tesla. All this means is that people are placing a premium on Tesla stock because they think Tesla\u2019s future will be even more profitable than where it is right now. We\u2019re in uncharted territory, on one hand GM is building infrastructure that won't start paying \u201cdividends\u201d until ten years from now, but on the other hand, we have Tesla which at this point is a tech company which has no choice but to succeed to justify it's current price.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on. \n\nVenmo and it\u2019s parent company PayPal just announced that starting in 2021, there will be a global roll out for the acceptance of digital currencies. This will allow people that use PayPal to be able to buy, sell, and hold digital coins like BTC, ETH, BCH, and LTC. Now if you live here in the United States, you\u2019ll be able to do that already in just a few weeks. But arguably the best part of their announcement is the fact that people will be able to use digital currencies to buy things from any of the 26 million stores that accept PayPal.\n\nPayPal has 346 million accounts that use their service and of those 346 million accounts, 10 million accounts are what\u2019s called merchant accounts which are businesses with a lot more money than individuals. This is the beginning of true e-commerce using digital currency. And here\u2019s why all of that matters.\n\nLooking at PayPal stock, it's up 94%. Square, a competitor of PayPal which introduced digital currencies in their app in 2018, is up 188%. Let\u2019s compare that to the traditional banks: Citibank, down 38%. Wells Fargo, down 54%. JPM who owns Chase Bank, down nearly 17%. Goldman Sachs, down 2.4%. US Bank, down 27%. If you're a CEO of one of these banks, you can see the writing is on the wall.\n\nCompanies are starting to accept and convert a portion of their balance sheets into digital currency. For example, a company called Micro Strategy converted $425 million of their money into this asset. Square also converted close to 50 million. More and more companies are starting to make this jump and the banks will soon follow. All of this has led to a huge boost not only in the stocks of some of these companies but also the currencies themselves. For example BTC is up nearly 52%. ETH, which this whole new financial system is being built on top of is up 127%. It\u2019s going to keep going up as more companies wake up to this reality to keep up with competition.\n\nFidelity - the investing giant, has already filed their Wise Origin BTC Index Fund with the SEC. That means for the first time ever in the US, it is possible to own digital currencies in a traditional index fund. Once it rolls out, you can bet companies like Vanguard, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, are all going to enter the space and compete with their own investing products.\n\nThis all matters because 18 months after an event called the halvening, the price of BTC has historically gone up 20x (which it has not done yet). Compared to the last bull run in the market, we know this time there are far more companies that have built access to buying, trading, and selling digital assets. The people who own these assets (mostly millennials) will see incredible price growth from the current price of $13k per coin, to between $100k - $250k. But is it too late to start investing?\n\nThere are roughly 54 million digital wallets around the world created since 2009. That means 99% of the entire world, does not own any of it. The disposable income for millennials going to grow over $7 trillion in the next 10 years\u00a0and by 2030, millennials will have five times as much wealth as they do right now. Digital currencies will eventually become the new normal and demand for it in the esports industry alone will be huge. Esports has already grown to be bigger than the music and movie industry combined and is expected to be a 300 billion dollar a year industry by 2025.\n\nFurther research: \nPompliano: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2Ja6fld\nFidelity study: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2J3D1nP\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

That is the the worst day that we\u2019ve had since June. What\u2019s different about this week is that we\u2019ve had all 3 indexes go down in unison, including the DOW Jones and the NASDAQ. What we learned this week is that no investment is 100% safe - not even investments that are considered defensive. \n\nFor example, gold and silver were down this week. Digital currencies were down this week. Even tech stocks which we\u2019ve learned do really well, lost value as well with Tesla down 4.3%, Facebook 5.5%, Amazon 3.7%, Apple 4.6%, Google 5.5% with the exception of Netflix.\n\nAll of this is happening because of 2 main reasons:\n\nReason #1, winter is coming, and the numbers are very real. Only 42% of people that were polled are comfortable going out to eat, 36% are comfortable going to a mall, only 33% are comfortable going on vacation which is also a reason why stocks like Carnival Cruise are down double digit percents, only 23% of people are comfortable going to the gym or the movies, and only 15% are comfortable traveling abroad ( source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3kEajbb ) As a result, 57% of people are saying they are considering restocking their supplies which might mean worse economic conditions for businesses. \n\nReason #2 elections which play a lot less of an important role in the stock market than people think. Since 1977 the economic growth rate average has been around 2.7% for the Republicans, and 2.9% for the Democrats. So it\u2019s about the same regardless of which party comes into office but historically the market peaks 1 week before which is exactly where we are at. If you\u2019re worried about your investments, your IRAs and 401k's the most important factor to consider is not the election but rather - Congress. Here is some really interesting historical data dating back from 1950, all the way to 2019 (results include several years of the S&P 90 because the S&P 500 wasn't invented until 1957)\n\nUnder a Democratic Congress, the S&P500 has averaged around 10.7% yearly returns. Under a republican congress, the S&P500 has returned 13.4%, that may not sound like that\u2019s a substantial difference, but 2.7% per year over the course of 20, 30+ years is a huge huge difference, here is an example.  If you started out with $100,000 and kept it in VTI, you would have ended with 4,349,022.32 under a republican congress versus 2,110,710.28 under the democratic one. But the best results have been under a split congress which returned 17.2% (more specifically the best combination has been a democratic president with a republican congress mix).\n\nIf we have a blue wave victory which could lead the stock market downward in the short term, here are some important things to consider and mistakes to avoid when investing.\n\n#1 Don\u2019t stop investing. I did a podcast with Graham Stephan where I showed quite a bit of cash but my situation is a little unique, unless you have a huge tax bill due or trying to buy some real estate, then continue investing.\n\n #2 Follow the Fed and monetary policy. During the Bush Senior and Bush Jr. administrations, the stock market didn't do too well. When the fed tightens up, the stock market doesn\u2019t do as good. Alternatively, Clinton and Reagan did really well because of falling interest rates which happens when the Fed loosens up which is what we\u2019re doing now, the stock market is very much supported by fed monetary policy so watch it closely.\n\n #3 Regardless of who is president, the stock market does not care. Do not make the mistake of being what\u2019s called a partisan investor. If you were to start investing in 1896, you would have ended up with significantly less money if you were waiting for your candidate to get elected versus investing the entire time. \n\nFurther research: \n10 Truths No Matter Who Wins: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2HOuB3y\nKeys To The White House: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3eittB1\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

This is especially popular with YouTube channels like my own, Graham Stephan, Meet Kevin, Nate O' Brien, Marco from WhiteBoard Finance, and Ryan Scribner. The truth is that much of what you see on the internet promising you on how to make money online, how to make money from home, make money with no money, learn investing with zero risk and instant profits, are all illegitimate. Let's talk about how to spot these and how not to fall for them.\n\nOne of the most popular how to make money online campaigns going on right now is through the use of the comment section. What they\u2019ll do is as soon as someone posts a video they will leave a comment like this one: \u201cWow this was a great video, I\u2019m glad I followed this advice and now I work from home and I make $10,000 an hour.\u201d That one was pretty obvious but sometimes, like a good magic trick, this comment can be hard to spot as some of them are a little bit more subtle in nature. Just like a good magic trick, the how to make money online industry consists of 3 acts. \n\nAct 1: \"The Pledge\u201d which consists of someone showing you what seems to be ordinary, but what it actually is, is the setup to taking your money. This usually involves beginners and learning how to invest or talking about their best investment which usually consists of outsourcing day trading, forex, or some other form of passive income investing that involves another person.\n\nAct 2: \"The Turn\" - the next phase is Act 2. More specifically, It\u2019s called the Turn, where you turn from being a skeptic, into a true believer that this person can help you make money by investing for you. That comment will get voted to the top of the video with a ton of likes because YouTube likes to push comments that generate the most engagement to the top of people\u2019s videos. Once you expand on that comment and read what is seemingly a normal conversation, the next phase of the act begins.\n\nAct 3: \"The Prestige\" - this is where they get your money by leaving positive reviews and testimonials in the comment section about their expert investor and how they are now making a ton of passive income. It's at this point where they will leave their contact information such as an email or phone number (which will also be formatted strangely with spacing between each character). This is where they take bank accounts, social security numbers, credit cards, debit cards, phone numbers, IDs, and anything they can get ahold of.\n\nThe other way consists of pretending to be the creator of the channel itself. The most effective way they use this is by responding to a comment asking for help. Some people have a hard time understanding how to start investing so they think the creator personally reached out to help them set up their account. The reality is that it's not the creator at all. \n\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, millennials are more likely to fall for this than older people believe it or not. Research is showing that 40% of people aged 20-29 that have reported these cases ended up losing money. The only difference between millennials and people aged 70 or older is that older people lost more money.\n\nGenerally speaking, if it promises you the following things, stay away:\n\n- If it promises that you\u2019ll be making money very fast, within just a week or even a few days\n- if it's a trial because what they do is loop you into a monthly subscription model until you cancel\n- if they promise you a fancy lifestyle by showcasing their car and their mansion it\u2019s probably not valuable information you\u2019re buying but a \u201csuccess mindset\u201d which has no real educational value\n- if you see an invitation to a live webinar - it isn\u2019t live and they are not being honest with you, it\u2019s prerecorded to make it look like it\u2019s live\n- If they advertise as \u201climited time offer limited space available\u201d, it\u2019s called forced scarcity which is just another marketing technique\n- if it\u2019s promising that you will make money for free, or that you will make money fast, or that it\u2019s a guarantee, no risk return investment\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

The idea is that each generation would make more than the generation that came before - that was called the American Dream, originally coined by James Truslow Adams in his 1931 book called The Epic of America. In those times, specifically in 1940, that was actually the case because 90% of kids born in that era did end up making more money than their parents. Today, that number is down to about half and is steadily declining.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor statistics just released their October data today and the unemployment rate fell to 6.9 percent, which leaves us with 11.1 million unemployed bringing us to where we were in around February of this year. So the good news is we\u2019ve recovered around half the jobs since before the start of the pandemic, more and more people are returning to work from their temporary layoffs. The people that are most protected are the high income earners, so if you earn $60,000 a year or more the recession is almost over. Unemployment in that income level is projected to be down roughly 0.1%  in comparison to prepandemic levels. But, if you\u2019re earning $27,000 or less, unemployment levels are still down double digits and it\u2019s not looking like it\u2019s getting much better because the amount of people that are permanently being laid off is actually increasing as companies are forced to restructure the way their businesses by decreasing costs and getting rid of \u201cnon essential labor\u201d (BLS: https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/pdf\/empsit.pdf)\n\nThis can be seen in many companies like Disney which is cutting 28,000 jobs, companies like Boeing announced they\u2019re cutting 30,000 jobs in the next 2 years, Exxon Mobil cutting 14,000 jobs, Raytheon is cutting 20,000 jobs, Chevron cutting 15% of it\u2019s entire workforce, and MGM has already laid off 18,000. The list goes on and on. Regardless of who becomes our next President, Congress will still be divided. The good news is that the greatest beneficiary to all of this division will be the stock market which generally prefers a divided congress and a democratic president where it has historically grown better. \n\nSome of the jobs that we lost will never return and the ones that will, are going to look very different from before the pandemic according to the World Economic Forum. Roughly 85 million jobs are going to be replaced by the change of automation by 2025, while 97 million will be added (estimated numbers). Here are some jobs that will see an increase in demand over the next 5 years (source: https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/reports\/the-future-of-jobs-report-2020\/digest)\n\nInternet of Things specialists, software and applications developers, cybersecurity \/ info security analysts, digital transformation specialists (which are people that look for existing and upcoming technologies to leverage growth and stay ahead of their competition), business development professionals, process automation specialists, digital marketing and strategy specialists (think social media), big data specialists, AI and machine learning, blockchain and data analysts and scientists. The 5 most important traits of these jobs are going to be creative thinking, analysis, problem solving, relationship \/ social influence, and tech skill.\n\nHere are some jobs that will be seeing a decrease in demand in the future. Machine repairman, operations managers, business services \/ administration managers, assembly and factory workers, accountants and auditors, bookkeepers and payroll clerks, administrative \/ executive secretaries, and data entry clerks. Mostly people that are in middle management positions.\n\nPlease use this time to level up your skillset in preparation for the next few years as this pandemic has sped up the automation process significantly.\n\nhttps:\/\/tracktherecovery.org\/\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

These investments are going to stand the test of time regardless if you are a growth investor, dividend stock investor, real estate investing, or a digital currency investor. Let's start with the best investment of all time according to Warren Buffett - \"This investment can\u2019t be beat, you can\u2019t be taxed on it, and inflation doesn\u2019t touch it, this investment supersedes all others: invest in yourself. Nobody can take away what you\u2019ve got in yourself, and everybody has potential they haven\u2019t used yet.\" Invest in yourself was the best cookie cutter advice I ever got, and I want to reiterate it back to you, more than you could ever imagine my passion for saying it. Now let\u2019s get to real list of the best 3 investments and get more specific.\n\nInvestment 1: Dividend Investing.  I look for a stock that yields between 2% - 4% or more depending on the dividend growth rate. For every $100 you invest, the % represents what you earn per year for as long as the company exists and pays a dividend. I also want to make sure it has a dividend growth rate of 10% or more, I\u2019ll settle for a lower yield, if it\u2019s less, I want it to grow faster. Here\u2019s a really cool way to find that information. \n\nGo to dividend.com, type in the stock you want to see, and you'll find a new tab called \u201cPayout Estimate\u201d. If you scroll all the way to the bottom you\u2019ll see the growth rates and how long they\u2019ve been growing the dividend. Here I want to see that they\u2019ve been paying dividends for at least 5 or more years (preferably 25 to be considered a dividend aristocrat)\n\nI also look for a P\/E ratio of 15 to 20 which allows me just to scan just the surface of the stock market to see where I could find some potential. You can find P\/E ratios anywhere on the internet or inside your best brokerage app (Robinhood, WeBull, M1 Finance, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Vanguard, etc.) but don\u2019t use P\/E ratios as your only metric, a lot of beginner investors make that mistake. Instead, use this little known secret which I haven\u2019t shared until now. The P\/B Ratio - price to book ratio. It measures the stock\u2019s current value and divides that by the company's asset value minus its liabilities (a P\/B of 1 or below is generally considered a good investment in the sense that it\u2019s undervalued in relation to where it should be. 1 is hard to find so people generally accept P\/Bs of 2s, and even 3s much like they do with P\/E ratios of 20 or less)\n\nInvestment 2: Real Estate. The cool thing about REIT stocks is they often pay monthly which means you can reinvest the money quicker allowing to it grow for longer. The downside is you pay taxes on them differently because they\u2019re taxed at ordinary income tax rates which for me, is not good because even though I\u2019m earning only $1100 which represents 13.3% of my yearly passive income, I\u2019ll be taxed at 37% based on my current income which is not so great. Another platform I use to invest in real estate is called Fundrise and I like this app a lot. \n\nInvestment 3: Digital Currencies (BTC, ETH):  I like digital currencies because I think especially with Joe Biden as president, we will see enormous inflation with more stimulus money pouring in from the government as well as the Fed if they continue adding to their balance sheet. Over the last 10 years, it has been the single highest returning asset class, and it\u2019s also been the riskiest which is why I keep no more than 10% of my net worth in it but I think over the next 5 years we\u2019re going to look back at 2020 and think wow, I wish I invested more.

Today I wanted to try investing in something else so I invested $24,493 on Pokemon cards.\n\nIn the year 2020 pokemon has probably been one of the best performing asset classes that you could have invested your money in. It all started with this guy, Logan Paul - who is one of the biggest YouTubers around who somewhat recently got into pokemon. As a result of his videos, the hobby has skyrocketed in price especially when he published a video of him bidding on a $200,000 box of pokemon cards which he did a live opening for on his channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iQ-f4N2yzTM\n\nBack when Pokemon was released a box like the one Logan opened retailed for around $150 which is a growth of roughly 133233%. That would have been a great investment if you had bought it at the retail price. However, Logan didn't open his packs, instead - he sold 35 of them for $11,000 a piece and kept one for himself giving him a 385,000 profit, and over a hundred thirty thousand for the national alliance and mental illness foundation. My friend Graham Stephan bought one and got a 1st edition Gyarados (last sold for $13,000 as a PSA 9)\n\nSo here is how much money my investment made so far from buying these pokemon packs a few weeks ago. I could have bought an entire booster box which has 36 packs, but that would only give me 12 holographic cards and the cheapest one now is selling for 36k on eBay so I\u2019d say I\u2019ve got a good deal for this stack of 15 (guaranteed holographic cards) - especially If I can pull a Charizard and get it professionally graded as a PSA10. A card like that last sold in October for $16,726. The odds of doing that are 1 in 16. So far I can already sell these packs for a profit because I even though I bought each one for an average of $1,500, they\u2019re already selling for between $2,550 to $4,200 for the same heavy packs with a guaranteed holographic card. This means my original investment cost me $24,493, but is now technically worth between $37,500 to roughly $60,000.\n\nI plan on opening these pokemon packs if I ever reach one million subscribers here on this platform. As soon as I do, I will live stream the event with my parents. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Because as of right now, millionaires make up roughly 0.9% of the our world and yet, they own about half of the world\u2019s entire wealth at $361 trillion dollars in approximate value, while the bottom 56% or roughly 1 out of 2 own only 1.8% of the global wealth according to the annual Global Wealth Report: https:\/\/bit.ly\/3nuuBVx\n\nThe idea of giving people money is becoming really popular lately especially when it comes to what\u2019s been going on in the world with talks of more stimulus for the economy and even other universal basic income plans like Andrew Yang\u2019s plan which comes in the form dividend payments of $1,000 a month. But let's go on the extreme end of things for argument sake and assume that everyone all of the sudden got a million dollars over night. For most people, if they got one million dollars they\u2019d probably be very happy about that and they\u2019d have lots of ideas on how to spend that money.\n\nFor example, the Charles Schwab Modern Wealth Survey asked people what they\u2019d do if they got one million dollars and they found that 21% of people or a 1\/5th said they would save it for a rainy day which is smart because one of the keystone principles of personal finance is to have an emergency fund that covers at least 3 to 6 months of expenses, that\u2019s one of the first rules of basic financial literacy.\n\nAnother 23% of people said they would invest that money which is smart. If you can invest one million dollars the right way, you can actually live your entire life withdrawing $40,000 a year and theoretically never run out of money because your money would grow faster than you can spend it. All you have to do is buy something like VTI which is an index ETF that tracks the total US stock market and hold on to it for the long term and it should return around 7% per year (over the long term)\n\nAnother 28% said they would pay down debt which is also extremely smart because the worst form of debt is credit card debt where the interest that people pay on credit cards can be upwards of 23% so getting rid of bad debt is smart and should always be a priority. Lastly, over half of the people polled or 54% said they would spend it on a house, a car, or leisurely expenses like traveling. But what if people actually got that million dollars?\n\n If that were to happen for real, the first thing people would do is go out and start buying stuff in mass so you\u2019d get massive amounts of traffic, accidents, and problems not unlike the Black Friday shopping deals we see every year. That\u2019s because as the announcement of this million dollars hits, it\u2019s going to take into effect piece by piece but not all at once because businesses have to adjust their prices just to make sure they have enough supply to meet this insane spike in demand from all these newly minted millionaires. \n\nBusinesses would not be able to supply everyone with enough stuff so grocery stores, movie theaters, restaurants, and basically every business that sells a product or service will be forced to shut down in order to re price everything to reflect this new demand. As a result, the dollar menu in McDonalds now becomes the $100 menu. A Toyota Corolla would increase from $15,000 to $150,000, and digital currencies like BTC almost literally go to the moon. This is also true for rents and home prices because they would skyrocket 100% or more almost overnight just because landlords know they can increase rent prices across the board and people would be able to afford to pay them. \n\nOverall the cost of living across the board would go up and most people would go broke again over the span of six months to one year. There's a few more interesting things that would happen and actually are happening in the world right now due to hyperinflation which the video discusses. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

If you can keep an open mind while watching this video I promise you\u2019ll get something out of it. Please remember this is just my opinion, this video is not investment advice, I\u2019m just sharing what I\u2019m doing with my money, I\u2019m not saying you should do the same. So here's what happened: I wired nearly $50,000 into Gemini, and I converted over $37,000 of USDC - into BTC.\n\nAt the time of making this video this investment is sitting at roughly $200,000. It\u2019s made up of 7.5 BTC, and about 120 ETH. In addition to that I have roughly $10,000 in my Gemini account where I have set for it to invest that money at $2,000 a day.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you might have missed out on this new revolutionary thing called Bitcoin. The technical definition of it is it\u2019s a \"peer to peer digital currency that is decentralized and immutable\". In lay person's terms, anyone can see where this money is being sent because we can send this money to each other across the world, any time we want, and no bank or government can stop us from doing business. It's a money that is not controlled or owned by anyone because it\u2019s decentralized. Each transaction is publicly available for all to see and every person can access these transactions to see where it's being sent and how it\u2019s being spent. Here's where I think it\u2019s going over the next year.\n\nThere is a max 21 million supply of BTC and in the US there is around 112 trillion dollars in terms of household wealth. If we assume 1% of the US population is interested in investing, that\u2019s around 1.2 trillion dollars. If we divide this hypothetical 1% demand by the max supply - we get a rough price of $57,142 per coin. If we get 2% of the population interested in investing the price doubles to $114,284 a coin. There are 46.8 millionaires in this world, there will only be 21 million bitcoin in existence. That means less than half of all the millionaires in the world will ever own an entire bitcoin.\n\nIf we apply this math to not just the US population but let\u2019s say the entire world and assume that just 1% of the world is interested - things get really interesting. The Global Wealth Report shows us that household wealth has reached 400 trillion and 1% to 2% of this wealth is 4 to 8 trillion dollars. Putting the same math to work we get each coin valued between $190k to $380k.\n\nIn addition to this, PayPal recently announced it was going to start accepting the use of digital currencies. Fidelity finally made their own Bitcoin ETF for wealthy people which signals the start of what I think will be a competition amongst other brokers to roll out more accessible ETFs. Square which is owned by Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey has invested in Bitcoin and bought $50 million dollars worth, MicroStrategy bought $425 million, and finally Grayscale Bitcoin Trust which represents institutional type of accredited investors owns 449,596 Bitcoins valued at roughly $8 billion dollars. On top of that, Stanley Druckenmiller who is a very wealthy hedge fund manager revealed that he now also owns Bitcoin, Mexico\u2019s second richest man, billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego revealed he holds 10% of his net worth in Bitcoin, and even Ray Dalio is no longer sure of his skepticism.\n\nAn analyst from none other than Citibank predicted BTC could go to $318,000 by December 2021 and published an entire research paper explaining his case (to be fair though he also predicted the price of gold at this point would be over double what it\u2019s at and he was wrong). But the point is, more people are starting to talk about it, corporations are buying into it, hedge fund managers are making it a staple part of their portfolios, new investments are starting to be created. Exciting times!\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only. Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

The couple makes money through Kevin's YouTube channel, Meet Kevin, which he started posting to regularly in 2018, as well as numerous affiliate programs. While they don't bring in seven figures every month \u2014 they earned $721,474 in September 2020 \u2014 they're on track to earn more than $6 million total this year.\n\nWhile some of their success can be attributed to good luck, they've also put in countless hours to get where they are today. As his YouTube channel became increasingly lucrative, Kevin, 28, began dedicating more and more time to creating content, including getting up before the sun to make several videos a day.\n\nKevin typically works 12 hours a day, from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. but reserves his evenings for family time. \"The goal is to have a drop-dead deadline of 5 p.m. to just hang out with the kids,\" he says.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC Make It.: http:\/\/cnb.cx\/2kxl2rf","publishedAt":"2020-11-23T22:59:59Z","tags":["CNBC Make It","Make It","How To Make It","Entrepreneurs","Starting A Small Business","Business Success","Small Businesses","Finance Tips","Career Tips","Money Management","Career Management","Managing Business","living on 50k a year","living on 100k a year","living on 200k a year","money diaries","r29 money diaries","millennial money cnbc","meet kevin","investing for beginners","how to invest","andrei jikh","california","real estate"],"title":"LIVING ON $6 MILLION A YEAR - Reacting To Meet Kevin","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HHiqjp97dU4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HHiqjp97dU4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HHiqjp97dU4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HHiqjp97dU4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HHiqjp97dU4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M49S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1092","dislikeCount":"158","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5875","viewCount":"127750"}},{"id":"W30SA8504oM","snippet":{"description":"My thoughts on the second economic shutdown, the effects, and the likelihood that it will happen\n\n\u25ba My Stock Portfolio + Stock Tracker: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/andreijikh\n\u25ba Get 3 Free Stocks on WeBull (Deposit $100 and get 2 stocks valued up to $1600): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/kol-us\/share.html?hl=en&inviteCode=QhhB1aDNwEDP\n\u25ba Get up to a $250 in Digital Currency: https:\/\/blockfi.com\/andrei\n\u25ba ROBINHOOD (Get 1 Stock When You Sign Up): https:\/\/robinhood.c3me6x.net\/c\/1980551\/671816\/10402\n\u25ba Open A Roth IRA: https:\/\/m1finance.8bxp97.net\/c\/1980551\/696710\/10646\n\u25ba How I Store My Digital Currency: https:\/\/shop.ledger.com\/pages\/ledger-nano-x?r=535643c13ab0\n\u25ba FREE Discord: https:\/\/discord.gg\/Hff86m9\n\u25ba Follow Me On Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/andreijikh\/\n\nHere are my thoughts regarding what's going on in the economy and what the chances and likelihood of a second shutdown will be. First, the Department of Labor just released their latest weekly unemployment insurance claims and the number was higher than we thought. We thought was it was going to be around 735,000 people, instead it ended up being 778,000 people. This past week marks the second week in a row where unemployment claims have been rising and 778,000 is also the highest week in the last 5 weeks. \n\nThe Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation Program which gives an additional 13 weeks of payments if you've used all of your available UI benefits, ends on December 26th. And on on December 31st, PUA or The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program which covered gig workers expires December 31st.\n\nThe amount of new cases is rising and the amount of patients in the hospital is at a record high. There are 1,440 minutes in a day. From November 19th to the 24th, we lost one person, every single minute of the day and that\u2019s in the US alone. We\u2019re averaging between 160,000 to 175,000 new cases per day, which is an increase of 43 percent from just two weeks earlier. Close to 13 million people have already been infected and we have lost over 250,000 lives. Understandably, due to all these record breaking numbers people are starting to get worried and there\u2019s talks of a second shutdown.\n\nWe just had thanksgiving, that means in the next 2 weeks, we\u2019re going to see a huge spike in more cases which is going to create conversation and more importantly, fear in the equity markets. Be prepared to see some volatility across the stock market, digital currencies, real estate - we are going to see some waves. But, the odds of a large scale, nationwide second shutdown are slim to none and here is exactly why. \n\nIt\u2019s important to understand something called State\u2019s Rights. These are \"political powers held for the state governments rather than the federal government according to the United States Constitution, reflecting especially the enumerated powers of Congress and the Tenth Amendment.\" What this means is that the ultimate decider of which laws get enacted are decided by the state as long as it doesn\u2019t conflict with the US constitution. The reason states rights is important is because it relates to our situation in that it makes it very difficult to pass a law that would require a nationwide stay at home order.\n\n The people who actually decide whether or not we stay at home are local government officials and the state governors that we the people elect and put in office. It\u2019s not so much that the government is inefficient or incompetent because I believe we\u2019re all good and we\u2019re all want the best for our families and our country, we just have different methods for running the country. The issue is that it\u2019s difficult to get everyone to agree on something. If it were up to me, here is how I would do it.\n\nFirst condition is If all the states agree to it by following the same guidelines laid out by the world health organization. We should wait until new daily cases are less than 1 per 100,000 of people in the population and until less than 3% of people tested, get a positive result. According to health experts, it\u2019s only at those levels when tracing new cases is effective to contain outbreaks. In addition to locking it down, we should pass an economic stimulus for businesses and people for however long it takes us to get down to those numbers.\n\nPositive news: The DOW Jones broke a first time record of hitting 30,000 points. The stocks that were responsible for pushing the dow the most were stocks in the energy, financials, and industrial sectors aka, the value stocks which I invested a lot in over the course of 2020 because I love dividends and passive income.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dol.gov\/ui\/data.pdf\nhttps:\/\/www.who.int\/\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

And that purpose is to buy me the ultimate luxury that money can buy which is time. Funny how we spend most of our lives converting our time into money, but then converting money back into time. This is where passive income comes in and there\u2019s lots of different ways of building that passive income from real estate, the stock market, dividends, online businesses, but ultimately the goal is to make money while you sleep. Before we can reach that point, we need to do a few other things first which is what this video is about to prepare you for. \n\nStep 1: Figure out how much money you need. Using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/news.release\/cesan.nr0.htm), people ages 65 and older are spending on average - roughly $50,860 per year, or $4,238.33 per month in retirement. This means if we were to use the standard 4% retirement rule, then we can work backwards to figure out $50,860 divided by .04 is $1,271,500 which is how much money people need invested pay for a relatively safe 30 year retirement (this is assuming no social security income).\n\nStep 2: Now that you know the full amount most people need ($1.27m pre social security, and roughly $827,000 with social security), compare that to your current spending levels by adding up the big 3 (housing, food, travel). Add up monthly expenses, multiply by 12, and multiply that result by 25. This is your current retirement number, if it's below step 1, you're on track, if it's above, you will need to eventually cut back on spending and save more money.\n\nStep 3: Smash the like button.\n\nStep 4: Side: Step 4: Calculate your savings rate. This one is thanks to Mr. Money Mustache. If you can save 10%, which is what the average person saves, it\u2019s going to take you 51 years to retire, so let\u2019s not do that and try to be better than average. If you can bump that up to 30%, you\u2019ll get there in 28 years. Not bad, but not as good as 50% which is what I aim for, and that\u2019s only 17 years. You can do this on a $50,000 a year income (I did this for 6 years). If you can reach 65% then it will only take you 10.5 years to retire, but you\u2019ll have to make a much higher salary closer to six figures to do that.\n\nStep 5: Get rid of unsecured debt. I did this for my dad using a HELOC loan. If you don't own a house, you can transfer your balance from one credit card to another using the 0% APR introductory offers for 18 months (Citi Double Cash card) until you pay off your principle.\n\nStep 6: Create an Emergency Fund. This one is optional. you don\u2019t need one if you have liquid assets, meaning, investments you can easily sell and convert into cash. Otherwise have at least 3 to 6 months enough to cover your basics. I\u2019ve been converting a part of my cash reserves into digital currencies because the interest it pays on those accounts is up to 8.5% per year which is more than the stock market. The downside, is that you are not going to be FDIC insured and you could lose your savings if they went out of business unlike a bank which would give you up to $250,000 savings back if it failed.\n\nStep 7: Open up a Roth IRA and start contributing to it. If you can, max it out. Put in $100 of the $1,000 to start because I promise the earlier you can start contributing to this one, the more it will grow into, and the more you\u2019ll keep for yourself because investments in this account grow tax free when you withdraw from it later in life. You can open your account with M1 finance like I did, or Robinhood, or even WeBull.\n\nStep 8: With all the money you have left assuming you took care of the other priorities, invest in yourself and\/or digital currencies. Step is about taking calculated risks with the remainder of your savings. This is especially important if you're young and you want. to start investing. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Right now, over 45 million people in America owe 1.6 trillion dollars worth of student loan debt with the average loan per student at $32,731. The median, which is probably closer to most people is lower at $17,000 with the average monthly payment between 2 to 3 hundred dollars per month. Regardless of how we look at it, we\u2019re closer than we\u2019ve ever been to having all that debt, cancelled. \n\nPresident elect Joe Biden is being advised by his democratic team that\u2019s led by Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer to issue an executive order to cancel up to $50,000 of student loan debt per person. So let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s going on, what this potentially means and how it affects us, as well as the odds of this potentially happening. Mr Schumer and Ms Warren want to create a resolution in Congress that would give the power to the president to issue an executive order to cancel that debt. Here\u2019s what the proposed resolution includes. \n\n1. It asks to forgive federal student loan debt, not private student loans\n2. The second thing it asks for is for this loan forgiveness to be excluded from any income taxes. \n3. It asks for the payments and interest of the current loans to be put on pause throughout the duration of the pandemic because the current student loan forgiveness program expires on December 31st of 2020.\n\nOne of the ways they want to make sure this happens is using something called the Higher Education Act of 1965 which gives financial aid like subsidized grants and student loans to qualified college students. It also gives money to help school programs, libraries, and scholarships. It\u2019s argued that this act gives power to the government to create and remove this debt. So the strategy would be for President Joe Biden to direct the secretary of education cancel up to $50,000 worth of debt.\n\nHere are reasons why people support cancelling college debt:\n\n1. The argument for doing this is that it\u2019s an easy way for the president to go around congress while it\u2019s still debating and bickering what to do about the stimulus. \n\n2. It\u2019s an easy way to deposit $200-$400 dollars almost immediately in the pockets of 45 million people. \n\n3. It\u2019s argued that it would help close the wealth gap for the latino and African American college students which have historically needed to borrow money more often than their counterparts. \n\nHere are arguments against cancelling student loan debt.\n\n1. It doesn\u2019t help people without student loans. In fact, that excludes roughly 80% of people in the US or 205 million people. \n\n2. The second reason against it is that it really only helps wealthier people in that it\u2019s precisely those people with loans that are more likely to have careers that are more on the higher pay scale.\n\n3. By forgiving student loans, you\u2019re also forgiving wealthy student loans, meaning students that come from wealthy parents that easily have the means to pay back those loans themselves without actual help from the government. \n\n4. It doesn\u2019t address our current problem with the economy let alone the education system. It potentially promotes irresponsible borrowing. \n\n5.  The last reason against it is more of an ethical question as far as what happens to people that never took out student loans at all specifically because they didn\u2019t want that debt? Or worse, people that did take out loans but paid them back in full, how do we compensate those people who may need stimulus help the most?\n\nUnder section 432(a) of the Higher Education Act, there\u2019s a clause that gives the secretary of education the power to \u201cmodify compromise, waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, or demand, however acquired, including any equity or any right of redemption.\u2019\u2019 It can be argued that this is possible but not without a long legal battle in Congress.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Are we still getting a second stimulus check? Luckily there are 3 new bills that I want to talk about that were recently introduced to get the ball rolling once again. Let\u2019s take a look at our 3 proposals and what we\u2019re going to get.\n\nProposal 1: Led by the democrats and Nancy Pelosi where they published an article on the speaker.gov (https:\/\/www.speaker.gov\/newsroom\/12120-5). To summarize it, it said Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Nancy Pelosi spoke about an omnibus appropriations bill on Monday December 1st. An omnibus is a proposed law that covers a variety of diverse and potentially unrelated issues and topics. We don't know much about this but so far, no stimulus check news as far as we know from that conversation on Monday. \n\nProposal 2: Second stimulus proposal was from a bipartisan group of lawmakers (both republicans and democrats) with a budget of $908 billion. It asked for $288 billion for small businesses such and the Paycheck Protection Program loan. As well as $160 billion for state and local governments which is something the Democrats have really fought for to have included in a stimulus bill, that the Republicans have fought against. But in exchange, the Republicans would get liability protections by temporarily freezing certain covid related lawsuits. There was also a federal unemployment benefit of $300 a week for an additional 4 months. $16 billion into helping get the vaccine into people\u2019s hands, contact tracing, as well as $82 billion for education and $45 billion into transportation. This stimulus was arguably the closest thing we had to a deal, unfortunately Mitch McConnell rejected this bill saying he didn't want to send the President a bill he didn't think he would sign. \n\nProposal 3: The third and final stimulus proposal was from Mitch McConnell at roughly $500 billion in budget.  First he wants to help businesses by supporting the Paycheck Protection Program and giving them $337.2 billion dollars. He also calls for $105 billion dollars for keeping schools operational, plus another $31 billion for the distribution of the vaccine, $16 billion for contact tracing and testing, and $5 billion dollars for childcare. All awesome things to have on the bill but it doesn\u2019t mention a lot of the things economists are urging us to pass. For example, his bill doesn\u2019t help people that are already out of work especially gig workers and freelancers that are to be almost literally left behind on December 31st where it\u2019s estimated that about 9.1 million people will be left without any government assistance (https:\/\/www.dol.gov\/ui\/data.pdf).\n\nUnfortunately, the 4 week extension on for unemployment benefits does not add additional weeks if you used up all your UI benefits. The third proposal also does not mention any stimulus checks.\n\nThe next date to watch out for will be December 11th when Congress gets together to propose a budget. They want to try and negotiate a deal by rolling the stimulus bill into the government budget. If this does not get done, there will be a risk for a government shutdown. December 11 is the key date to pay attention to for our next hope for a stimulus check\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Investing in the stock market doesn't have to be difficult, in fact, it's really simple! In order to understand the answer to that question, I'll start the video by showing you how much dividends I made last month in November.\n\nLast month I made $26,168 with my dividend portfolio. That\u2019s an insane amount of money. People talk about compound interest, where eventually your money makes you money, and then that money makes money and so on and so forth. This is a perfect example of that happening in real time. At some point, your stocks will reach a level where the compound interest and the growth on it per month is going to be more money than you can earn working a 9 to 5 job. That\u2019s the goal. In addition to that, I made $743.57 in dividend income, and an effective $933 in dividend raises as well. So here\u2019s the breakdown for that. \n\n#1: $743.57 for the month of November in dividend income. But what\u2019s interesting is if I compare that to my last year\u2019s income in November, I only earned $409.58, that represents a growth of 81.5% from last year's November. I\u2019ve consistently made more by just reinvesting my dividends and buying more stocks. \n\n#2 On top of the dividend income, the second source is from dividend increases. This happens when a company takes the profit it\u2019s made and instead of reinvesting back into their own company to make more products, they give us a pay raise. This doesn\u2019t always happen, but I try to find companies that follow that trend. There is a downside to this. #1 I pay more in taxes because dividend income is taxed, even if I reinvest it automatically. The second downside is that the stock usually drops by exactly the same amount as the paid out dividend per share. I received $37 per year extra this month which is roughly the same as investing $933 at 4%.\n\nIf you add up my dividend increases which is an effective $933, plus my dividend income which was $743.57 that equals $1676.57. Not bad for a month\u2019s work of doing nothing. But wait, there\u2019s more. On top of my dividend income, I earned interest on digital currencies and this past  month I made .04 BTC ($770) which is roughly $770 bringing the actual monthly passive income total to $2446 but unfortunately it\u2019s not dividend related, and it\u2019s not FDIC or SIPC insured so it's a higher risk than my dividend income.\n\nBack to the original question of how much money you need to retire with dividends. To answer that question you first have to figure out what you\u2019re comfortable with living on in terms of an income. For most people, $40,000 to $50,000 can afford them to live virtually anywhere in the world especially with something called geographical arbitrage which is where you go to a different country where the purchasing power of the dollar affords you more stuff. Like for example my city of Astrakhan, which is where I was originally born, where the average monthly net income after taxes is $249 - that\u2019s per month - that equals $3,000 per year. Using what you\u2019ve learned know that in order to make $3k at 4%, you need $75,000. \n\nThe reason I love dividend investing is because I can plan for my future by calculating my cash flow vs my debt rather than trying to time selling my stocks in a perfect economy. So the final answer as to how much money you need invested to live off dividends is your yearly desired income divided by a dividend yield that you are comfortable investing in. Using the standard 4%, most people need roughly 1 million dollars invested in dividend stocks to be able to live off of the passive income. If I wanted to make $100,000 a year, that would be 2.5 million. That\u2019s really my ultimate goal.

I want to give credit to Ken McElroy who originally inspired my idea with his own video which was a response to Meet Kevin\u2019s original video about real estate. So let\u2019s get right into it starting with the problem.\n\nFirst let\u2019s talk about delinquencies. What is a delinquency? Delinquencies are when you don\u2019t make your monthly mortgage payment on time. Not to be confused with a default which usually happens after your delinquent several times after which point your loan goes into default. \n\nIf these defaults don\u2019t get taken care of then that\u2019s when it is sent to the collection agencies where you will see a huge drop in your credit score. To avoid that from happening besides obviously paying on time, people refinance their homes to make their monthly mortgage cheaper and more affordable. According to Black Knight, it\u2019s also why we\u2019re going to see more than 9 million refinance in 2020 which is the highest levels that we\u2019ve ever seen. People are taking advantage of low interest rates so if you\u2019ve been thinking about doing it, seriously consider doing it because you\u2019ll probably benefit.\n\nEven though October\u2019s national delinquency rate was down 3.3%, the lowest since March of 2020, and even though we\u2019re down 64,000 serious delinquencies which is an improvement, we are still up nearly twice as much as we were at the start of 2020, and we still have over 1.8 million serious delinquencies which is 5 times higher than they were before the pandemic started. Not to mention the period between October to November usually sees an uptick of delinquencies by about 4%. The cities that will be hit the hardest are Las Vegas, Miami, Orlando, New Orleans, and New York (highest delinquency rates in the country).\n\nBefore we see a decrease in real estate prices though, we\u2019re going to more spikes in average home prices for a while in certain markets that are cheaper like Las Vegas but that\u2019s short term optimism boosted by people leaving big cities like New York City, like Los Angeles, like San Francisco to buy in cheaper towns like here, so they can save money on taxes and work remotely in cheaper towns. This spike in prices will also be thanks to help from the government but all of that is short term. There\u2019s only so much we can drop interest rates to prop up real estate before we can\u2019t go lower unless we go negative - which the Fed stated they don\u2019t want to do. But mostly, it comes down to two things. Jobs and government.\n\nFor starters, government - there is going to be a wave of forbearances due at the end of December. 39% of forbearance plans are going to expire and most of those plans are reaching their 9 month period. They\u2019ll be allowed to extend an additional 3 months after that which puts us to March 2021 (plus extra month of delinqency) putting us between April \/ May timeframe where can see what's going on in real estate. Logic is pointing us toward an increase in inventory levels that should in theory drop our prices. \n\nThe second factor is jobs. The world economic forum predicts 85 million jobs will be lost to automation which is huge and coupled with the pandemic and that's a potential recipe for a very bad time for real estate, however, with the eviction crisis right around the corner, there will be a huge demand for rental housing, so that can potentially do very well.\n\nTo protect myself, I'm investing in inflation protected assets. A study by Charles Schwab (https:\/\/bit.ly\/2JN9DmR) found that when inflation was above 4%, commodities and gold were the assets for investors. When it was 2% or lower, the S&P 500 was the #1 best investment. This is why I'm buying both digital currencies and stocks as we go into 2021 and I'll wait until April\/May to see where real estate will be before I buy investment properties and real estate in general. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nRemember the stock market crash in March of this year? Quadruple Witching happened on Friday the 20th, and then we hit a stock market bottom on that Monday March 23, it was the lowest the stock market had been this year. So it\u2019s going to get interesting. If you\u2019re an investor in the stock market whether that\u2019s an index fund investing in the S&P500 or a passive income dividend investor like myself, this is a very important video to watch. On December 18th, we\u2019re going to get something called the The Quadruple Witching Day in the stock market. What does that mean? \n\nThe Quadruple Witching event happens when stock index futures, stock index options, stock futures, and single stock options all expire at the exact same day. Usually it\u2019s the last hour of the trading day that sees an increase in trading and peak performance of volatility and price movements.This happens relatively often which is another way it got it\u2019s name because it happens on a Friday, in fact the third Friday of March, June, September, and December - and on December 18th specifically, we\u2019re going to get our last Quadruple Witching day of 2020. So let\u2019s break it down.\n\n1. Stock index futures expire. The most important thing to understand about futures is that they aren\u2019t actually investments in and of themselves, instead, they are considered derivatives which means their value is derived from something else. In this case, an index future takes it\u2019s value from the index itself. When I say \u201cindex\u201d by the way, it just refers to a set of criteria that we create. Some good examples are the S&P500 which tracks the 500 biggest companies in the US, there\u2019s the NASDAQ, the Dow Jones Industrial Average etc. So an index future looks at an index, and tries to predict it\u2019s future value at a specific date. That\u2019s why they\u2019re called futures. A bunch of contracts in the market expire on December 18th.\n\n2. Stock index options expire. Options contracts, exactly like futures contracts, are derivatives in that they aren\u2019t investments themselves, they are just bets trying to predict where the stock market is going to go. Except unlike a stock option which is a contract on a single stock like Disney for example, this is a stock option index which looks at exactly the same type of indexes I mentioned for futures. The difference between futures and options is options give people the option to trade their contracts but it's not an obligation. \n\n3 & 4. The third wave of these expirations are individual stock futures and these are no different than the stock index futures I described in the first part except these are individual stocks unlike an index which remember is a basket of stocks that track specific markets. The fourth thing to expire is going to be single stock options, exactly like the second thing, except instead of indexes, it\u2019s individual stock options. Okay - so we\u2019ve set the stage. On December 18th, you\u2019re going to see some more volume, and volatility and price movements in the stock market so don\u2019t be surprised if you wake up, check your stocks and see them all over the place. So going forward this week, there\u2019s two things you need to know.\n\n1. There\u2019s no evidence that shows us the stock market will go up because of this event, and there are no studies that show it usually goes down either. Typically, it\u2019s a non event that doesn\u2019t really do much at all and you could just as easily sleep right through it. For me, I'm going to sell my stocks. Don't worry, not all of them, just my biggest losing ones and I show you the 6 in this video.\n\n2. Tax Loss Harvesting. I can sell my stocks for up to $3,000 worth of losses this year, and carry over the rest to next year, saving me money on taxes. Alternatively, I can do something called a free step up in cost basis which is a way to buy stocks while lowering my tax burden in the future.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nBitcoin. You've probably heard of it. Some people think it\u2019s a scam and other people treat it like a religion, in this video, I wanted to put myself between the two and speak objectively of what makes good money and why Bitcoin even has value. The truth can be hard to see through the hype so first, what just happened to Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin finally smashed through its all time record high of $20,000 for the first time ever. In today\u2019s video I wanted to show you why that happened, and the price of Bitcoin is ultimately going to go and why. \n\nGold has historically been the best form of money that humanity has ever created - until now. Let's see what makes good money valuable and why people think Bitcoin is the new gold. In order for money to be considered a \"good money\" it has to have 5 properties.\n\n1. Divisibility. Gold, is not really divisible in it\u2019s purest form, I can\u2019t shave off a few chunks of gold and pay you with precisions. The dollar is only divisible up 100 times, which is 100 pennies. But with 1 Bitcoin, I can divide it into 100,000,000 pieces - those are called Satoshis which is an homage to the entity that created Bitcoin. Divisibility is important in moving us toward a more efficient on demand economy where can focus on consumption based taxes instead of income based.\n\n2. Durability. Gold is bad because it\u2019s easily melted and mixed with impurities, and fiat is arguably worse because you can destroy paper pretty easily too. \n\n3. Rarity. That sounds like an easy thing to do but it took civilization forever to agree on a standard we were all happy with because the people who lived by the beach wanted to use sea shells which is obviously more abundant near the ocean. That\u2019s why we used Gold because it was relatively evenly spread out, it was pretty hard to find, and it was like that for everyone around the world. The dollar however, is the exact opposite because it\u2019s printed by the billions of dollars a day sometimes which is why they say your money loses value to inflation, because we keep creating more of them.\n\n4. Acceptability. Money has to be accepted by society worldwide, whether it's your local grocery store or the internet.\n\n5. Uniformity \/ Fungibility. This means each unit of value is exactly the same. Bitcoin actually has a problem here that I think it will be solved in the future, but the problem is that we can track each Bitcoin\u2019s origin from wallet to wallet meaning in theory, certain Bitcoins are tainted with criminal activity that can be repossessed by the government, while others can be seen as pure - obviously the pure ones are going to be more valuable than ones that are not. That problem will eventually be solved once Bitcoin solves privacy with techniques like shuffling or mixing.\n\nSo why is the price jumping above the all time high of $20,000? It\u2019s finally now that respected hedge fund managers are starting to realize it for themselves which is why we\u2019ve recently been seeing investors pour billions of dollars into Bitcoin - they finally see the light and understand that at this point, it has become more of a risk to not own any Bitcoin than it is to at least hold some. \n\nBut that\u2019s the narrative, the reality is they\u2019re all smart, and they, along with banks and corporations, have already been slowly buying for a long time while telling everyone else that it was a scam. Even the Chief Investing Officer, Scott Minerd of Guggenheim Investments - has publicly come forward in saying that his billion dollar hedge fund has been investing in Bitcoin since it was at $10,000 and his team thinks Bitcoin will eventually go to 400,000 per coin - that's the fundamental value of it. \n\nCoupled with economic uncertainty and the federal reserve's stance on infinite quantitative easing - and we have a perfect storm. An asset class that's going to continue outperforming everything else.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nRobinhood just agreed to pay the SEC a $65 million fine - and now there\u2019s some new changes to are coming to the app that are pretty controversial and it\u2019s created some confusion and questions as to whether or not we should continue using Robinhood or take our money elsewhere. So if you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on, let me give you a brief overview and a backstory of what\u2019s going on. - The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Securities Division has accused Robinhood of 5 acts of misconduct. \n\n1. Robinhood is accused of using aggressive marketing tactics to lure inexperienced investors.\n \n2. Failing to make changes that were considered reasonable to prevent anymore stock market outages like the ones we had earlier this year where all stock trading stopped during the peak of the year on March 2nd and partially March 3.\n\n3. Taking advantage of new investors by gamifying investing.\n\n4. Failed to follow their own rules and policies for supervising stock options trading.\n\n5. A breach in fiduciary conduct that is required by the Act and Regulations.\n\n Prior to 2013, we had to pay fees for buying and selling stocks, but Robinhood changed the game of finance and investing forever - so of course, their app grew exponentially. Their customer base grew by 500% between the years of 2016, and 2018 from 1 million people, to six million people. But between the end of 2019, and May 2020, they grew from ten million to thirteen million - that\u2019s 30% in just a few months. \n\nAs of last about a week and a half ago, Robinhood had $1.6 billion dollars worth from about 486,000 customers from the state of Massachusetts. It\u2019s argued that during this time, Robinhood was advertising itself to really young and inexperienced investors. For example, of those that were approved to do options trading (which is arguably the most dangerous reckless form of investing) 68% were approved to trade, despite those same customers informing Robinhood that they had limited or no prior investment experience. \n\nFurthermore, between January 1st 2020, to end of November 2020, Robinhood has as many as 70 stock market trading outages. March 2nd was the biggest point gain in the history of the Dow Jones Average, and the app left millions of people unable to buy or sell stocks when the market opened - for the entirety of that day, and the same issue happened partially on the third. The SEC document argues by that point Robinhood should have known that it\u2019s current infrastructure wasn\u2019t able to handle that kind of traffic and should have upgraded.\n\nOnce the people that were invited signed on and became customers, Robinhood allegedly flooded them with strategies that are argued to have been designed to get people to continue investing and keep people coming back for more - the accusation here is an issue of gamification which is a very fine line that brokerages can not cross. The cash management tool was another example of this which invited people to tap the live action icon 1,000 times a day to move up in the line queue - all tactics that are arguably addicting game like strategies. \n\nThe SEC document also says that Robinhood allowed people to make an unlimited amount of trades and to encourage more trading activity , Robinhood had a list of the most traded stocks which was a widely popular tool that people used to inform their investing decisions. \n\nAs a result, Robinhood is making new changes. Starting on January 11, 2021, we\u2019ll no longer be able to buy closed-end funds, limited partnerships, master limited partnerships, royalty trusts, tracking stocks, New York registry shares, and units on Robinhood.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the top 10 investing apps of 2020. What are the best investing apps? These are the best apps for investing in the stock market, real estate, digital currencies, investing for beginners and for people that live outside the US. Anyone who's interesting in building passive income needs to have these apps on their smartphone. Let's start the countdown:\n\nBEST FOR BUDGETING AND SAVING\n\n10. Mint - What I really like about this app is how it lets you organize every transaction you make and label it into separate parts which is really useful because then you\u2019ll see where you\u2019re money you\u2019re probably wasting. Another reason why I love this app is because it shows you your credit score automagically and gives you alerts when it senses that you spent more money than you typically do. I think it is hands down the best tool for tracking how you\u2019re spending your money and how much money you\u2019re actually making. \n\n9. Personal Capital - This app is also completely free, and it\u2019s extremely popular with over 2 million people using it. This app is much more powerful than Mint because it lets you take action because it integrates your investment accounts as well so you can actually see how you\u2019re doing in relationship to your retirement goals.\n\n8. Acorns - The reason Acorns is awesome is because it rounds up your purchase to the nearest dollar, then it takes that difference from your checking account, and then deposits it into the Acorns app where that money is then invested. Once you buy something for (example $4.95) it\u2019s going to round up to $5 and save five cents and put in a holding account, where it would then be distributed among your investments. The best parts of this app is that it\u2019s clean, it\u2019s simple, easy to use, great for beginners but there is a couple downsides to this app. The downside is you can't pick stocks and the fee structure is very expensive in relation to the balance for beginner investors.\n\n7. Wealthfront - is awesome because it takes everything you need to know about investing and just does it for you automatically because it takes your money, and invests it across different types of assets automagically from individual stocks to ETFs. The downside is that it takes it has a small fee 0.25% which means for every $100,000 you invest, you\u2019ll pay $250 a year. The other downside is it has a minimum investment requirement of $500 but it\u2019s worth it.\n\n6. Vanguard - I started investing way back in 2012 with Vanguard and I followed one of the best pieces of advice I got about investing in the stock market which was just to buy the biggest mutual fund in the world - VTSAX. If you\u2019ve ever heard of index fund investing and how it\u2019s the best thing you can ever do, this is the best place to do it. The best traditional brokerage for investing with index funds. Thank you John Bogle!\n\n5. Fidelity - The next one on this list is the best brokerage for retirement accounts, these are your IRAs and 401ks. If you ever heard of the ROTH, or the Traditional IRA, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Fidelity is known to have the best fill orders in the stock market which means you'll get the best and cheapest stock prices.\n\n4. Interactive Brokers -The best brokerage for international investors or people looking to invest outside the US. Be careful of fees which vary from country to country.\n\n3. M1 Finance - I love M1 Finance, it\u2019s got a really sleek design. It uses a very different system because it has what\u2019s known as the pie. The downside of the app is no control over when you buy stocks unless you pay for premium service.\n\n2. Robinhood. The app that started it all, investing made simple and free. Unfortunately they had a lot of hiccups this year but overall a tremendously useful and beginner friendly all around investing app.\n\n1. WeBull. Every feature you could ever want. Downside? Complex UI. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only. Links above include affiliate commission or referrals.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the future for investors in relation to Joe Biden becoming the next president and what will happen to the stock market. If you\u2019re an investor like me, you might be wondering how to invest with Joe Biden as President because there was talks about Joe Biden raising taxes on the wealthy class which negatively affects businesses and jobs. \n\nHowever, since the announcement of Joe Biden as President, the stock market has hit an all time high and continues to increase, in fact it\u2019s up a little more than 10% since the elections which means the stock market is actually more excited about a Biden presidency than a Donald Trump presidency at this time in 2016 when the stock market rose by about 5% during this same time period. Why are investors so excited and why is the stock market doing so well despite our weakened economy?\n\nThree main reasons. The stock market is happy that the elections are over. The federal reserve signals no interest rate increases until 2023. Moderna, Pfizer, and BioNTech have all released their vaccines and people are getting them. The future is bright. However, businesses are still restricted, people are still being let go, and we're still in the middle of a pandemic, so if you're an investor you might be wondering \"is the stock market overvalued?\"\n\nThe stock market is not the same as the economy. Data from FredStLouis shows a scatter plot between the GDP which is the measurement of economic health - and the S&P500 - which is the stock market, and in case you don\u2019t know how to read a scatter plot, in order to see a positive relationship between two variables, you should see an uphill line - that\u2019s goals, when it\u2019s a downhill line, there\u2019s relationship is weak. Here's what they found: https:\/\/fredblog.stlouisfed.org\/2019\/08\/the-stock-market-is-not-the-economy\/?utm_source=CBNList&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=CentralBankerNewsletter09_19\n\nIt\u2019s just a blob of dots randomly centered in one spot. That means there\u2019s no clear pattern therefore no relationship exists between our economy, and the stock market. \n\nNow that we understand the background for what's going on, let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going to happen to investors with Joe Biden as president because that does have some influence on the stock market\u2019s future.\n\nOn January 5th which is when we\u2019re going to have the senate runoff elections in Georgia. 2 seats are up for grabs. Right now, no political side has control over which laws will be passed because they can\u2019t agree to anything - the stock market sees this as a good thing because no one side can use their influence to create policies that will potentially disrupt the stock market. The stock market and investors love a gridlock, and the Wall Street is telling us that the stock market is pricing in a republican victory and control over the senate. \n\nThe stock market wants Congress to be split. The reason for that is because historically the stock market has had the best performance (averaging 17.2% per year) with a Democratic president, and a divided Congress. So it looks like good news in the future if you're an investor. As for me, here are 3 things I'll be investing in.\n\n1. Dividend stocks - Over the last 40 years, 71% of the stock market\u2019s growth has come from reinvested dividends, it has not come from the price growth of stocks. Prices can lie, cash flow does not.\n\n2. Bitcoin and Ethereum just in case I\u2019m wrong about everything and the whole foundation of the banking system gets disrupted by new technology. Since I made that video just a few weeks ago, Bitcoin has gone from roughly 20,000 to now touching 27,000. My $100,000 investment has paid off.\n\n3. Buying real estate. The short term goal is to own at least 1 house next year whether that\u2019s for me to live in or to rent out somewhere between the 300k to 600k price range. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nIt\u2019s been the most financially rewarding year of my entire life, but otherwise for my family - it\u2019s been the most difficult. If you've ever wanted to become a millionaire, or if you have ever wondered how to make money online, or how to make money on YouTube, just remember your net worth isn't related much to your happiness. But if you're still wanting to do it, here's how I did it, and here's how much I made with a million subscribers.\n\nThe first source of my income is my YouTube ad revenue. In 2019 (just two years ago), I was putting out 2 videos a week. By May, I made a little over $5,000 while working 60 hours a week. That means I made $4.21 per hour - which is below a minimum wage income. However, my growth became exponential once I became comfortable with YouTube and I started to grow quickly with my first 5 figure month in September. By the end of 2019, my income was $122,952 for ad revenue alone.\n\nIn 2020, everything changed. I started making 5 figures consistently and I got comfortable with how to make videos online in a way people enjoyed. My ad revenue income for 2020 is currently at $663,304 - but I'm not even halfway through the income I made in 2020. There's a lot more! \n\nPatreon: $176,793. The next passive income stream is Patreon which is a service creators use to generate more passive income by adding more value to their audience. They do this by making bonus videos. Since I'm a personal finance channel, I made a spreadsheet to track your stocks in the stock market so you know how much passive income you're making. The overall 2020 total for Patreon is $176,793.\n\nNext is course sales. In May of 2019, there was more than 500 hours of video that was uploaded to YouTube every single minute. That\u2019s 30,000 hours per hour of uploads. That makes it very difficult to compete unless you have help from someone else. I made a grand total of $0 because I don't have anything - until today! \n\nI put together a class that shows you step by step, the entire breakdown of how to build an online social media brand on YouTube from scratch, regardless of your skill or knowledge - I take you step by step and show you how I plan all my videos, how I film them, how I edit them, all the different ways you can make money on YouTube, basically it\u2019s all the stuff I wish I knew when I first started with regards to how this stuff works and how to make money with it. \n\nThere\u2019s 70 relatively short videos, it\u2019s around 4 hours long, and the classes will constantly be updated with new information, and you\u2019ll even get my pre-made templates for how I make my thumbnails, branding and setting up your channel, and very soon, the titles I make on YouTube. If you want to learn how I made my income, you can learn here (https:\/\/www.andreijikh.com)\n\nAffiliates \/ Affiliate Marketing: $872,174. I have just a few affiliate links set up which I really only mention at the end of my videos but altogether, for the year of 2020 was $872,174. I'm sure if I wanted to sign up to even more apps - I would make much more than that but I really only ever talk about products I believe and stand 100% behind.\n\nSponsorships: $0. I don't like to be paid to speak positively about investing \/ personal finance apps because I integrity with money is the most important part of what I do.\n\nThe next source of YouTube related income are miscellaneous items like referrals and Amazon links. Referrals are similar to affiliates except anyone can join them, you don\u2019t even need a social media. I generated roughly $18,555 in 2020.\n\nGRAND TOTAL INCOME: $1,739,826 - In comparison to my first year on YouTube where I made a grand total of roughly $170,000, my second year was a grand total of $1,739,826. I couldn't be more grateful for the opportunity.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nUsually I don\u2019t make videos about the stimulus and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen plenty of these videos by now but I haven\u2019t seen anyone talking about what they just snuck in there.  Just please understand, this is not about President Donald Trump, this is not about republicans vs democrats, this is just purely something interesting that I think you should know about because the last round of stimulus includes billions and billions of dollars in special interest tax breaks for some very strange stuff. The problem is the bill itself was 5,593 pages long and Congress literally had 6 hours to read it all but the bigger issues are these.\n\n1.  if you go the bill right now (https:\/\/rules.house.gov\/sites\/democrats.rules.house.gov\/files\/BILLS-116HR133SA-RCP-116-68.pdf) and you search for these key words - you\u2019ll see it yourself: the word aircatft appears 208 times, the word munition 46 times, weapon 46 times. What about the stuff that\u2019s actually important and useful? Healthcare 24 times, Forbearance 11 times, Nurse 3 times, Doctor twice, masks 0. Let\u2019s break down where the money is going because remember, at the end of the day, we - the tax payers are going to be paying for all this and I think we should know what\u2019s in it. \n\n2. One of the bigger items on this list is on page 471 for weapons procurement for the Navy which includes production, modification, and modernization of missiles, torpedoes, other weapons, and related support equipment in the amount of $4,477,773,000 to remain available until September 2023. \n\n3. Page 278, we\u2019re also giving $2.142 billion to Air Force weapon procurement. Plus another $2.31 billion to the Space Force. This is all in addition to the $740 billion dollars the military received just two weeks ago which also included a 3% pay raise. \n\n4. $500,000,000 for Israel, yes - that one is actually real and it\u2019s on page 341 for defense, weapons, and research systems - but other countries received help as well so it wouldn\u2019t be fair to disenfranchise Israel: Cambodia is getting 85.5 million, Nepal $130.2 million, Burma $134.9 million, $250 million for Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman, $453 million for Ukraine.\n\n5. Random policy regarding the succession or reincarnation of the Dalai Lama - page 5098. The reason it\u2019s in there is that it\u2019s supposed to challenge China\u2019s claim that they can pick who the next Dalai Lama will be. I know this is a very important issue that\u2019s supposed to protect cultural and religious freedoms in Tibet since China\u2019s invasion of Tibet in 1950 - but this seems oddly placed.\n\n6. 10 years prison time for streaming torrented content\n\nHere\u2019s the actual truth behind why this is all happening. The reason that this 5,500 page bill seems so strange is because the actual stimulus relief bill - was only for $900 billion dollars. Congress knew that they\u2019d never agree with each other on passing these two bills separately. So instead, they rolled the relief bill into the $1.4 trillion dollar omnibus spending bill that they had to vote on to keep the government from shutting down - and in the 1.4 trillion dollar bill - that\u2019s where we had all the spending on defense systems, foreign aid, and other random clauses that were passed along for the ride.\n\nFortunately there is some good news to the bill that was passed. $600 stimulus checks. It also includes unemployment benefits for an additional 11 weeks. It at least something but the potentially bad news is President Donald Trump said it was too small of a check and he would like for the stimulus check to be closer to $2,000 per person which is estimated to cost roughly an additional $370 billion dollars (which means he may not sign this current bill)\n\nOverall, it\u2019s unfortunate Congress used the relief bill as a bargaining chip to pass special interests.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nMany people want to invest and buy Bitcoin, and now is as good a time as ever before in the year 2021. First, as an investor in cryptocurrency, I want you to know that I am biased. I invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum as early as 2014, recently I made a video of me buying another $100,000\u2019s worth, and since then, the balance has grown to over $300,000 at the time of making this video and I think there\u2019s a lot more room for growth.\n\nStep 1. The best place to buy Bitcoin. I\u2019ll start it off with my two favorite brokerages that I invest with, which is Gemini and Coinbase - I have accounts with both - you really can\u2019t go wrong with either one but the signup process is almost identical with each. Safety, simplicity, and value are my priorities. I want my coins to be safe and I want to invest in a trust worthy source, and I want an interface that looks simple. \n\nAll brokerages require KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) laws to be followed. This means no matter where you invest your money, companies will ask you for your personal credentials like your social security, your phone number, your address, just like any other legitimate brokerage you would use - that is standard.\n\nStep 2. Make your accounts secure by downloading an app called Authy from the app store. This will help with 2 factor authentication in making sure your bitcoins are safe and secure. You can also add a secondary layer of security by adding a biometric key if you have a laptop that allows for it.\n\nStep 3. Once you've secured your account, you have to fund it. Avoid funding or buying Bitcoin with debit and credit cards. They charge a 3.49% interest which is half of what the stock market returns in a year - don't do it. Instead, connect your bank accounts and use either ACH Transfers or Wires. ACH transfers have smaller limits ($15,000 daily).\n\nStep 4. Buying bitcoin. Once you fund your account, you can invest either once, daily, weekly, etc, if you want to average into it over time. Personally, I buy it all at once but averaging in can be a great idea. Once you bought some and you've invested your money, HODL for dear life!\n\nStep 5. Once the Bitcoin settles into your account, which can take some time depending on how you funded your account, you have two main options. A cold wallet, or a hot wallet. The hot wallet is keeping your Bitcoin online, the benefit is that you have nearly instant liquidity, meaning instant access to either buy more, trade more, sell it, or put your money to work and make interest off of it. The downside is you\u2019re taking on a risk and trusting that the exchange or the website you keep your coins on is secure enough to not lose your money. \n\nI use Blockf for earning interest (blockfi.com\/andrei) but there's also other companies like celcius.network and nexo.io - all great choices. I like Blockfi because they have a lot of respected venture capital money and they partner with Gemini (which is the brokerage I use primarily).\n\nStep 6. The cold wallet method is storing your coins offline. The benefit? Security. The downside? You're potentially losing money to inflation because your money is just sitting there (luckily it still appreciates but why not earn some passive income on the side?) The Nano ledger is $59 and I would recommend storing your money here once you reach at least $1,000 of a balance. Just remember, only you can set it up, no one else must ever see your secret key phrases.\n\n Step 7. If you traded currencies or sold for a profit\/loss - you need to report it. I use app.taxbit.com and they integrate your accounts with cryptocurrency in a way that doesn\u2019t give them full access, it gives them view access and it calculates everything automatically where you can then just print it out and give it to your tax person.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

On January 1st, the minimum wage has gone up in 20 states, and 32 cities and counties and there\u2019s a roadmap for this to increase in many other states later in 2021 - where eventually people are going to fight for $15 per hour. So in today\u2019s video I wanted to talk about who\u2019s getting the increase, how much for, and how or if this will affect the rest of the country.\n\nI remember my first minimum wage job - it was at a magic shop ironically, I was selling magic tricks to tourists. I was 15 at the time and I remember starting that part time job at $8.25 an hour - that was 16 years ago. So I saved up all the money I could, and it took me 3 months of working the entire summer to save up and buy a camera. That camera cost $1,500. That minimum wage of $8.25 an hour that I was paid when I was only 15, is still very close to the minimum wage today. That same $1500 in 2004, would cost $2,066.40 which is a 37.8% increase. Inflation is real.\n\nTo help with incomes, we have two different sets of wage laws - the state minimum wage and the federal minimum wage. Now the federal minimum wage is officially $7.25 per hour which hasn\u2019t changed since 2009 and all the federal wage does is it tells the states what the legal minimum requirement is, but the federal law cannot tell the states what they should pay other than the minimum. States with a lower minimum wage than the federal wage have to follow the Fair Labor Standard Act, so it\u2019s automatically reverted back up to the federal minimum of $7.25. This is to make sure states don\u2019t just set the minimum to a dollar and take advantage of people's labor.\n\nFor people that are excited about the increase to the minimum wage and if you\u2019ve read articles that say $15 per hour is going to be the new standard, unfortunately that\u2019s not the entire truth. Let me show you the breakdown of which states have increased their minimum hourly rate and by how much.\n\nAlaska: $10.19 to $10.34 (up 15 cents)\nArizona: $12 to $12.15 (up 15 cents)\nArkansas: $10 to $11 (up one dollar)\nCalifornia: $13 to $14 (up one dollar)\nColorado: $12 to $12.32 (up 32 cents)\nFlorida: $8.56 to $8.65 (up nine cents)\nIllinois: $10 to $11 (up one dollar)\nMaine: $12 to $12.15 (up 15 cents)\nMaryland: $11 to $11.75 (up 75 cents)\nMassachusetts: $12.75 to $13.50 (up 75 cents)\nMichigan: 9.65 to 9.87 (up 22 cents)\nMinnesota: $10 to $10.08 (up eight cents)\nMissouri: $9.45 to $10.30 (up 85 cents)\nMontana: $8.65 to $8.75 (up 10 cents)\nNevada: 9 to 9.75 (up 75 cents)\nNew Jersey: $11 to $12 (up one dollar)\nNew Mexico: $9 to $10.50 (up $1.50)\nNew York: $11.80 to $12.50 (up 70 cents)\nOhio: $8.70 to $8.80 (up 10 cents)\nSouth Dakota: $9.30 to $9.45 (up 15 cents)\nVermont: $10.96 to $11.75 (up 79 cents)\nWashington: 13.50 to 13.69 (up 19 cents)\n\nADVANTAGES:\nImproves the quality of life which allows people to actually provide for the basic necessities. We think that increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per by 2025 would help roughly 1.3 million people out of poverty and boost 17 million people\u2019s incomes - that\u2019s great! Another benefit is you get happier employees that actually work longer so there\u2019s less of a turnover rate. And by increasing the hourly rate, it would actually decrease people\u2019s real income by only .1% (https:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/publication\/55410)\n\nDISADVANTAGES:\nEven though there\u2019s a push to increase wages to $15 per hour by the year 2025, in relation to how much prices will have grown, the effects will potentially cancel each other out. Nevada just increased from $8.25  to a whole $9 an hour. That represents a 9% increase but inflation has eaten away 37.8% in comparison. So that is still a fraction of the increase that is necessary to catch us up to where we need to be. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.laborlawcenter.com\/state-minimum-wage-rates\/ \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nBitcoin or Ethereum, which one should you buy and invest in? Regardless if you like passive income, dividends, the stock market, or which brokerage you use (Robinhood, WeBull, M1 Finance, Vanguard, etc.) this is something you should know about before investing your money. First, let's see how Bitcoin and Ethereum are similar.\n\nThey\u2019re both considered cryptocurrencies, both are investments people like to speculate on by buying and selling on brokerages like Gemini and Coinbase, both were born using blockchain technology, and both of them are what\u2019s considered decentralized mediums of exchange. But in a lot of ways, they\u2019re very different. Let me separate the fact from fiction and let\u2019s begin with the one that everyone seems to be talking about right now, the one that is sky rocketing in price - Bitcoin. \n\nTo understand the importance that Bitcoin is about to have in the near future, we have to travel back to the past - to 1964. A Russian Physicist by the name of Nikolai Kardashev, came up with a scale of measuring the output of a planets energy. We then used his creation, as a scale for finding civilizations outside of Earth. He described 3 main civilization types. Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 civilizations. So here\u2019s the breakdown of what each one means.\n\nType 1: an interplanetary civilization capable of harnessing the sun's energy, and controlling the weather of the planet.\n\nType 2: A stellar civilization that has full control over the sun's energy output via something called a Dyson Sphere. A type 2 is immortal because this species can colonize other planets.\n\nType 3: Galactic. This is a civilization that can travel to galaxies and harness the energy of the black hole. \n\n On this scale, we are type 0. Technically we're .7 but we're moving toward becoming a type 1. For example, the planetary language is English, that's a type 1 language. Type 1 communications is the internet and the smart phone, a type 1 culture is also very similar to what we see globally inspired by Hollywood and social media. The next step is a type 1 money system, and that's where crypto comes in. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum want to achieve different results. \n\nBitcoin wants to be the store of value which means it's competing with gold. The market cap of gold is around $10 trillion. If we take the market cap of Bitcoin (roughly $700 billion) and divide the two, we get a factor of roughly 14. Take that and multiply 14 by the current price and we get a per coin value ($39,000) of roughly $557,000. That will happen this decade. However, inflation will also increase the price of other assets like stocks and real estate as well.\n\nEthereum on the other hand wants to be what economists call M1 money, the global physical currency in circulation (coins, etc.) The market cap of M1 is much larger than gold's, however, because Ethereum does not have a fixed supply like Bitcoin, its price per coin will most likely not exceed Bitcoin's. However, the market cap can and most likely will. Ethereum will disrupt many industries in the near future with its smart contracts by creating DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations. Imagine companies that can exist without any kind of management. \n\nThink of buying a house right now. You have to go through a bank, you have to find a real estate agent that has to show you houses, who then speaks to the sellers agent, who then speaks to the buyer and negotiates the final price and then there\u2019s middleman companies like escrow and so and so forth. That is insanely complicated over something that could be literally as simple as creating a listing on a decentralized website that is locked to an ethereum based smart contract. This is just the beginning. The price of Ether can go upward of $10,000 by 2025. Neither of these cryptocurrencies are trying to accomplish the same thing, they are both very powerful and integral to our future economy.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nAs Bitcoin increased in price, people got scared and started buying. Now that Bitcoin is falling, this is important. I want to give my perspectives when I think it\u2019s relevant and Bitcoin is still fresh on everybody\u2019s mind. I hope that by watching this video you walk away with a more balanced perspective by hearing two opposite sides from someone who\u2019s a crypto skeptic and someone who is more of a believer. \n\nIssue 1: Let\u2019s start with the first issue that Graham Stephan has with Bitcoin  which is the danger of regulation. Can the government ban bitcoin? If it does, to what extent will the price fall and will Bitcoin become irrelevant? One of his concerns is about the government tying your digital wallet to your identity therefore allowing them to know how much money you make and how you spend it. \n\nResponse: It\u2019s actually no different than the system we have in place today. If the government really wanted to know what you were buying and how much you were making, they\u2019d find out real quick so it\u2019s not a big concern for me. I want the government to have a clearer policy on regulation because as soon as that happens we can finally get a clearer legal perspective and feel safer about investing. Also equity markets would finally create investments that grandpa and grandma can put in their retirement accounts.\n\nIssue 2: Tether. Now tether is not a crypto as much as it\u2019s a \u201cstable coin\u201d meaning for every dollar that you buy, one Tether will be created and issued to the market. It\u2019s a 1 for 1 that was meant to hold the value of a single dollar by attaching itself to the dollar. The problem is that technically those tethers could have been printed out of thin air, not at all backed by the dollar. What\u2019s worse, is that when asked to be audited by a third party agency, Tether refused while admitting that only 75% of their token is backed by cash. Not good.\n\nResponse: Price manipulation isn\u2019t an argument against Bitcoin. I\u2019ll quote Warren Buffet and say price is what you pay, but value is what you get. So while the price of Bitcoin may be outrageously high, the value of what it actually is, which is the potential future of our economic backbone, is still there - regardless of what you pay for it. It still helps all investors looking for passive income and looking to hedge their money against inflation.\n\nIssue 3: Volatility. Here Graham Stephan says that Bitcoin's price is super volatile, it can move up and down as much as 20%+ in a single day. \"Crypto whales\" are people that can influence the price of Bitcoin. \n\nResponse: In 2009 when Bitcoin launched, it would move up and down by as much 90%+ per day because the market cap was tiny - in the thousands of dollars, then as it grew a little bigger, it started moving 70% per day. Now it\u2019s a big deal when Bitcoin moves 20% per day, and at some point it will be a big deal for it to move 1% per day just like the the stock market. Stability will come with increased liquidity and volume which over time decrease volatility.\n\nIssue 4: Bitcoin is backed by nothing. At least the dollar has the backing of the US government where we can redeem it at face value anywhere in the world.\n\nResponse: This is the intrinsic value problem. However, everything is based on trust. I don\u2019t have to trust the government to give Bitcoin value and redeem it, the free and open market decided that Bitcoin has value. It was designed to be trust-less based on mathematics. I know exactly how many Bitcoins there will be 20 years from now unlike the dollar. \n\nIssue 5: People only buy it to speculate, not for the technology.\n\nResponse: The CFTC classified Bitcoin as a commodity.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nThe value of all cryptocurrencies in the market has now surpassed a trillion dollars, and Bitcoin has become the 5th most traded currency in the world. So should you buy bitcoin now, or wait? When I started investing and buying Bitcoin, I didn\u2019t know how to even look at the price and relate it back to anything that I understood and I hard time because Bitcoin is not like stocks. At least in the stock market, you can look at things like the balance sheet, cash flow, sales growth, dividends, payout ratio, debt levels, etc. But Bitcoin is a commodity so how do you judge it's true price?\n\nLet\u2019s start start with the fundamental analysis then we\u2019ll go macro. Fundamental means judging something based on measurable, factual data to see if something is under priced or over priced. Macro is piecing all the bits & pieces together with what\u2019s going on. So the first metric is going to be on chain data specifically we\u2019re gonna take a look at:\n\n1. Transaction Volume - What transaction volume is, is a measure of how much people are using Bitcoin. Why is that important? It\u2019s important because we need to know, are people actually using this technology or are they just speculating on the price? \n\nIf you go to blockchain.com\/charts, you\u2019ll see that graph where it shows you transactions per day. Click on \"all time\" data. When you do that, you\u2019ll see that since Bitcoin was created in 2009, the transaction volume has been steadily growing. This is very good. This tells us the network effect that is Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is increasing and the technology is becoming more adopted and accepted.\n\n2. Wallet Data - when you buy a Bitcoin, you are given a unique wallet address where your Bitcoins are held. So again, let\u2019s use blockchain.com and look at their wallet data. From 2011 all the way to 2021 the present day, we have roughly 64.7 million unique wallets. The more unique wallets that are created, the more we can see the network effect grow. Network effect is important because it cannot be copied over by simply copying and pasting the code of Bitcoin. That's what makes Bitcoin unique from all the other cryptocurrency.\n\n3. Hash rate - The textbook definition is it\u2019s a way to measure the processing power of the Bitcoin network. There\u2019s 42 million millionaires out there in the world, and only 21 million Bitcoins in existence that will ever be made. So how much of the price is inflated, versus the technology actually being used and adopted? Let\u2019s jump back into blockchain.com and find the hash rate chart. You can see over a decade, it\u2019s grown exponentially which is usually how technology gets adopted. Good technology usually doesn\u2019t go in a linear line, it\u2019s exponential and the current hash rate of Bitcoin is sitting around 151 tera hashes per second - which means the Bitcoin network can process 151 trillion calculations per second.\n\nAll of this data shows us that Bitcoin's price increase is supported by real measurable growth. Now let's take a look at some macro analysis.\n\nWhenever we\u2019ve created any kind technology, whether it\u2019s been the microwave, the refrigerator, the cellphone, the internet - they all followed the same general path of adoption - the S Curve. The S Curve is a way to measure how long it takes for technology to penetrate the market (couldn\u2019t help myself).  Once the inflection point of an S curve happens - the adoption takes off to the masses into exponential growth. \n\nLast year in 2020 Bitcoin did around a trillion dollars of on chain transaction volume, that is more than Apple Pay, Venmo, or PayPal. That shows me that It\u2019s at this point in the phase of technology where the growth becomes exponential. I think we are still in the early adopters phase just about to begin the exponential growth this decade from the years 2021 to around 2030. Other investor catalysts include regulation, a Bitcoin ETF, and institutional \/ bank buying. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nI became a millionaire in one year, all it took was a small loan of a million dollars from my father. I\u2019m kidding that\u2019s now how it happened. I made a video about how to become a millionaire in one year (my plan), and now it's about 1 year later and I want to give you an update. Getting to a million took developing good habits early on, and following them consistently by living below your means, saving money, and investing it. Let's break down my net worth and invested assets into 3 categories.\n\n1. Cryptocurrency\nThe first one is my cryptocurrency investments which I hold in BlockFi, and here it is -  the total balance in my BlockFi account is roughly $438,457. I\u2019ve talked about them before but an incredibly powerful savings account for your cryptocurrency. You can hold different currencies and depending on which ones you deposit, your savings rate will go up and down. For example if you deposit something like USDC which is a stable coin from coinbase, a big crypto broker, you\u2019ll get their maximum rate of 8.6%. They make money by taking our savings, and using them to lend out your money with high interest rates, and in return for keeping your money with them, they pay out a high interest rate and they keep the difference between the money they lend out, and they money they pay us. My bitcoin and ethereum holdings have been my best investments this year.\n\n2. Stock Market\nI have 3 main accounts in the stock market, my retirement account with M1 Finance, my trading account (which I don't use often) with WeBull, and my main account which has all my dividend stocks which is Robinhood. It\u2019s worth roughly $282,457 which is nice, but it\u2019s not as nice as the $7,638 I made in 2020 from just holding on to the stocks I have anyway, which I then reinvested back into the portfolio and it\u2019s grown a lot because energy stocks have been crushing it. I try to invest like a contrarian by buying what people think is unpopular which is why my energy stocks have performed extremely well these last few months.\n\n3. Cash\nThe total amount I have in all my banks across all my accounts is 1,428,000. The reason I have so much cash is becauseI\u2019m about to pay a huge tax bill, and I\u2019m trying to buy real estate. Since I can\u2019t get financing - I have to buy it in cash. But for now, this brings my total net worth to $2,195,457 - not counting this months income which is going to be one of the highest incomes I\u2019ve ever had so that number might be closer to 2.4 million.\n\nTreat your income not like your true income. Instead, It\u2019s the passive income that is the real number, which is why I still live way below my means. My true income at this point is not very high but I\u2019m working on it every single day. Even though I\u2019ve made a substantial amount of money with YouTube in 2020, I don\u2019t buy fancy stuff, instead I continue to reinvest it so that the Andrei Jikh of the future, can look back at the Andrei of today and be proud that I had the foresight to take care of my older self by living below my means, and investing consistently. Set good habits early on and stick to them.\n\nI also bought 100 shares of Apple because the tech sector had a selloff due to fear of unfavorable regulation. I'm underweighted in the tech sector which means I need to own more stocks in the technology sector and Apple is my favorite. It's almost never on discount but when it is, I will always invest in it! \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nSo which stocks are the best in 2021? Let's review what happened last year. In 2020 the S&P 500 dropped 34% in roughly just one month which made it the fastest bear market we\u2019ve ever seen, there was a huge sell off due to the pandemic. Almost immediately our government reacted with the multi trillion dollar Cares Act where in 2020 alone, we printed a quarter of the entire monetary supply - in just one year. We went from 15,337 billion in the beginning of January to 19,071 billion at the end of December. \n\nThere was now more money in the system competing for the same amount of stuff that was already there before. So if you invested in March of 2020, you very quickly would have made more than 60% returns on your money. The S&P500 finished the year with a growth of 18.29% which again is pretty incredible considering how bad the collapse of the market was.\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden wants another $1.9 trillion dollars so there\u2019s a good chance that we\u2019ll see more money printing, even if it isn\u2019t that final number. For all these reasons, this is why I'm going to be buying the dip and start dollar cost averaging into the stock market consistently every single month whenever I see an opportunity because inflation is real. \n\nIn order to put my money to work quickly, I\u2019ve switched to DRIP which is the automatic dividend reinvestment plan for each of my stocks. Normally when get paid dividends from holding stocks, I try to wait until I collect enough money, then I pick a stock that I feel is undervalued and then use that money to buy a new stock. The problem is I'm often times holding too much cash and I'd rather put it to work so I can generate compound interest.\n\nWhy I think the stock market will go up. \n\n#1. Share buybacks. Share buybacks dropped by roughly 41% during the pandemic as the world kind of stopped, but now share buybacks are slowly coming back. This has already been happening in 2020 with stocks like Apple, T Mobile, Google, Microsoft, Regen Pharmaceuticals, Oracle, Berkshire Hathaway and most recently, Netflix is considering it as well. \n\n2. Stocks splits, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve probably heard of. I think we\u2019ll see a lot more of those so keep an eye open. Stock splits are going to be the new share buyback program for 2021. We\u2019re going to see companies split their stocks just like we had Apple split 4 for 1 in August and Tesla 5 for 1. We\u2019re going to see tech companies like Google, Netflix or Amazon for example who\u2019s share price is nearly $3,300 at this point and most people are afraid to buy a stock with such a high value - even though we have fractional shares, most people don't know that.\n\n3. Inflation. 78% of all the dollars in existence today, have been printed, in just the last 10 years. That is crazy. The fed has told interest rates are going to be low till 2023, the Democratic Party has officially taken office, everyone know about the push for stimulus which will also have a lot of people using their stimulus checks to invest.\n\nObviously, some parts of the economy are going to grow quicker than others, we saw that with tech in 2020. Tech took off and EV - Tesla is up more than 1000% which makes even Bitcoin jealous. \n\nCyclicals will do well. Cyclicals are stocks that rotate in and out of the economy. For example, consumer discretionary, basic materials, financial Service, and real estate. Stocks like VFC, Polaris, William Sonoma, Target, etc. anything that where consumers go and spend their discretionary income once they\u2019re back to work and they\u2019re actually making money - including restaurant stocks will see a comeback assuming the economy recovers. \n\nThe biggest winners beside EV and clean energy is going to be fintech companies. Paypal, Square, Shopify, and banks like Goldman Sachs and perhaps JP Morgan. The one I'm personally most excited about is the Coinbase IPO which I treat like a cryptocurrency ETF. \n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nSomeone discovered an alleged critical flaw in Bitcoin. It\u2019s called the Double Spend attack and it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like. It allows you to spend your Bitcoin twice, or get paid twice, which is a problem - because it goes against the entire idea of it being scarce. On January 21, Bitcoin\u2019s price fell almost instantly as the news came out and people started talking about it. We even had Janet Yallen who is the treasury secretary come out and speak against cryptocurrencies saying that we need to find a way to curtail them. \n\nWe are still very early in the crypto space. So early in fact, one of the biggest tech YouTubers (Lew from Unbox Therapy) talked about it in one of his videos. Except at the top of his search bar in that video, he looked for \"Bitcoin Stock\". What's interesting about that is that there is no such thing as Bitcoin stock, Bitcoin is not owned by a company. If someone as smart and tech savvy as Lew is still trying to figure it out, it's obvious we have a long way to go. So what actually happened?\n\nFirst let me introduce you to the concept of FUD which means fear, uncertainty and doubt. One of the things you have to understand if you want to buy Bitcoin or if you want to start investing is that this space is still very much the Wild Wild West. People will do anything and everything they can to spread misinformation, fear, and uncertainty, and doubt to get people to panic to sell their Bitcoins at a lower price and crash it - this gives a chance for people with a lot of money to buy more.\n\nIn order to understand what happened to Bitcoin, it's important to understand how blockchain works. Anytime someone sends or uses a Bitcoin, those transactions get sent to the block (1 megabyte in size). These blocks are mined roughly every 10 minutes in exchange for rewards in the form of fees. Imagine a Rubik's cube that miners solve in order to mine their rewards, it works in a similar way. Now also imagine that miners also drive a bus. \n\nHere\u2019s where it gets a little more technical, in order for our transaction to get included into this Rubik\u2019s cube, we have to pay a small fee for using Bitcoin. Technically we don\u2019t have to, but if we don\u2019t pay the fee, our transaction may not get included in the block, instead - it might be included in another block. You can think of it like waiting at a bus station which comes roughly every ten minutes because that\u2019s how long it takes for us to solve each block. Think of this bus driver as being motivated by money and he only takes on customers with the highest priority. Here's what happend on January 18th.\n\nSomeone made a transaction and paid 1 satoshis per byte in fees which was too low and the transaction got stuck in what's called the \"mempool\" (imagine that's where people wait for the bus to pick them up). He waited an entire day, until January 19 when he broadcast the exact same transaction but with a slightly higher fee (9.4 satoshis per byte). The technical term is RBF or Replace By Fee. He then waited an hour before broadcasting a third transaction (second RBF at 14.3 satoshis per byte) and his transaction was finally confirmed. This is where the internet lost it and got confused.\n\nBefore he was able to make his second RBF, the blockchain split in two (which can happen multiply times a month by design). Think of it like an alternate reality \/ universe was created where there were now two versions. By design, Bitcoin can only have one valid chain with the most proof of work. In the alternate reality his third transaction was accepted, but that's not the reality that ended up with the most proof of work. Instead, it was the reality where he broadcast his first transaction that became the valid chain, therefore it confused people into thinking he paid twice.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nWhat happened to Gamestop (GME)? What happened to AMC stock? Lots of small cap stocks have risen over a thousand percent this year thanks to a group of people. Wallstreetbets is a subreddit or sub-community of reddit. Thanks to their efforts, they revealed one of the biggest flaws about the stock market which is the perception that we have a \"free market\".\n\nFirst, it started with Gamestop. Usually when a stock goes up in price, it's because of a good quarterly earnings report or things like sales growth. Instead, Gamestop went up because of a technical exploit where people realized that they could drive up the price of a stock by buying up stocks that hedge funds thought would go down (that's called shorting a stock). By buying up all the inventory of Gamestop, it drove the price higher which forced the hedge funds to cover their positions by buying more stock from the people they borrowed the stock to begin with but at a much higher premium. This created an infinite feedback loop of the price skyrocketing higher and higher. Even Elon Musk tweeted \"Gamestonk\" which also helped grow the Wallstreetbets community to several million people - thus creating a miniature hedge fund of its own. This is where our story begins.\n\nFor the first time since I\u2019ve ever been alive, we - the retail investors, are winning on a public level. In order to understand which stocks to buy and why - you have to understand situation and how each side makes money. One one hand, we have institutional investors or hedge funds. These investors are made up of extremely wealthy people that manage money for other people that you will probably not be able to invest with - because you don\u2019t have enough money. Since the beginning of time - hedge funds ruled the stock markets. Until now.\n\nThis is where the retail investors come in. We realized this week that our strength in numbers allows to make a counter trade against hedge funds in order to make a profit and beat them at their game. We forced hedge funds to spend more of their money covering their positions which is why you\u2019re seeing people on reddit become millionaires. But the best part is who is paying for people to get rich. Companies like Melvin Capital and Citron which have lost over 5 billion dollars trying to short GameStop. Hedge funds are bleeding money to the point of needing a bailout. But the story gets even deeper.\n\nAs a result, we had all the fintech companies like Robinhood and WeBull, including brokerages like TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab (and the NASDAQ) shut down trading of those stocks which revealed to us how flawed the financial system is because it's rigged to help the wealthy hedge funds and protect them from being beaten. This understandably upset a lot of people but the again, the truth is more nuanced. The fintech companies are middleman between the buyers (ourselves) and the market makers. Ironically, it was Citadel that was the market maker for Robinhood. All Robinhood does is route our order flows through to them. The theory is that the entity responsible for shutting down trading could very well have been someone other than the brokerages people are looking at. We don't have all the facts yet.\n\nRegardless of who we blame, this week revealed to us the need for DeFi, decentralized finance. Before this point, words like Bitcoin, Blockchain, Decentralization were just marketing words used to hype up cryptocurrencies. Instead, we found out just why we need them. To prevent censorship and to allow a free market to truly exist, we need to build investing platforms that have no central point of failure that cannot be shutdown by greedy corporations. \n\nAs far as which stocks you should buy - no one knows which stock will go up and you should be very careful investing your money into these short term trades because people will lose money - especially if this censorship and control continues to exist. What wallstreetbets did this week for the stock market was nothing short of miraculous and we're seeing history unfold in front of us.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

Rainbow Blvd # 270\nLas Vegas, NV 89103\n\nWhat is Dogecoin? \nDogecoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that's based on the blockchain. Created as a joke by two software engineers in 2013, Dogecoin was meant to get people interested in the crypto space by integrating internet meme culture. It was originally a fork of Luckycoin, which was a fork of Litecoin, which was a fork of Bitcoin. \n\nWhy is it going up in price?\nDogecoin spiked around 877% this week before falling back down and now it\u2019s sitting at roughly 3 cents a coin which means it\u2019s still up around 530%. If you invested a thousand dollars into Dogecoin just one week ago and sold at the peak, you would have made $9,000. Similar to wallstreetbets and GME (Gamestop Stock), Dogecoin's price has recently been supported by the help of another investor community on reddit called SatoshiStreetBets. The current goal of Dogecoin is to get it to $1.\n\nDogecoin VS Bitcoin (Advantages)\nDogecoin has a few advantages over Bitcoin. First, it has a block time of 1 minute meaning it's a \"better\" currency due it's faster ability to confirm transactions quicker. It's also cheaper to use but that's partially because it's less popular than Bitcoin and therefore there is less competition for the transactions to compete with each other to get included in the block (less competition in the mempool).\n\nDogecoin VS Bitcoin (Disadvantages)\nBitcoin is a deflationary currency. When miners mine Bitcoin, the difficulty increases over time and the rewards get cut in half roughly every 4 years (the halvening event). This means it's a deflationary currency which makes it more scarce over time and therefore increases its value. Dogecoin is the opposite - it's an inflationary currency. Each block on Dogecoin rewards miners with 10,000 coins, and because we know that the blocktime is 1 minute, we know we are making dogecoins at the rate of 10,000 coins per minute. There is no upper limit to how many Dogecoins can exist which means when there is no demand, the currency will still continue to make more of itself which will further devalue the price over time. \n\nDogecoin To The Moon (Reaching $1)\nCurrently the market cap of dogecoin (according to coinmarketcap) is roughly 3.8 billion dollars and each coin is roughly 3 cents. If we divide our goal ($1) by current price (.03) we get a factor of 33x. That is a 3,300% increase from the current price. If we multiply 33x by current market cap, we get 125,400,000,000. This means Dogecoin has to eclipse the size of the top 8 cryptocurrencies combined, which includes: Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Chainlink, Cardano, Polkadot, Ripple, and Tether). The closest competitor to that would be Ethereum which has massive support in terms of app developers, products, and investors. While it's certainly possible to get to $1, it will take quite a bit of effort and money.\n\nWhere To Buy Dogecoin\nBinance, VCC Exchange, BKEX, Paribu, and Kraken. Sign up to all of these (I'm not paid, sponsored, or affiliated with any of them) because some will approve you quicker than others. Also, some exchanges can crash and you don't want to be stuck using only one, you need to have options. Please remember they trade in different pairs (meaning you can't buy with your dollars). You first have to fund your account with dollars, exchange to something like Tether, then exchange Tether for Dogecoin. After you buy, do not keep it on the exchange, send it to a cold storage wallet like the Nano Ledger (link above).\n\nMy Thoughts on Dogecoin\nDogecoin is here to stay. Like internet meme culture - it will always be relevant. It doesn\u2019t pretend to try to change the world, it doesn\u2019t promise anything because 1 doge will always be 1 doge - it\u2019s just a fun coin that will continue to grow in line with the overall market cap of the cryptocurrency world as people get more comfortable with buying and investing. I'm not against owning any, I think it's a fun collectible but full disclosure - I do not currently own any.\n\n*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.

One Poor.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Rich Dad was built from a simple lesson learned by Robert Kiyosaki at an early age. He had two dads -- one rich and one poor.\r\n\r\nRobert's poor dad, his natural father, was highly educated, the head of the Hawaiian school system, and enjoyed a decent salary. Yet, he constantly complained about having being broke and continually said, \"I can't afford it.\"\r\n\r\nRobert's rich dad, his best friend's father, was a high-school dropout building a business. He wasn't wealthy. Yet, he constantly enjoyed the finer things in life and always asked, \"How can I afford it?\"\r\n\r\nThe contrast between Robert's two dads taught him a great lesson. Robert realized his poor dad's outlook suppressed his dreams and closed his mind to the possibility of financial freedom. He died penniless and full of regret.\r\n\r\nHis rich dad's outlook elevated his dreams and opened his mind to life's possibilities. He achieved great wealth, financial freedom, and enjoyed life to the fullest.\r\n\r\nBoth were good and highly capable men. But only one lived richly.\r\nFinancial Literacy is The Key to the Rich Life.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Rich Dad was built from a simple lesson learned by Robert Kiyosaki at an early age. He had two dads -- one rich and one poor.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life, Robert's rich dad taught him many valuable, financial lessons. Sometimes Robert listened. Sometimes he had to learn the hard way. But by applying these lessons, Robert became financially-free and retired.\r\n\r\nHowever, Robert wasn't content with retirement. Fueled by the passion to share his financial wisdom with others, Robert created his board game, CASHFLOW\u00ae, based on his belief that people learn best through simulation. In 1997, he wrote \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" and the rest was history. The book is the best-selling, personal finance book of all time, and it gave Robert the opportunity to teach valuable, financial lessons to a worldwide audience.","publishedAt":"2011-08-10T16:02:57Z","tags":["Rich Dad","financial education","financial literacy","Robert Kiyosaki","Kiyowaki","Rich Dad Poor Dad","Rich Dad Scam","Rich Dad Scams","Rich Dad Education Scam","Rich Dad Education Scams","TheRichDadChannel"],"title":"Financial Education Video - Robert Kiyosaki's New, Rich Dad Site Helps Boost Financial Literacy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r-hJ5_n600E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r-hJ5_n600E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r-hJ5_n600E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r-hJ5_n600E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r-hJ5_n600E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5","dislikeCount":"1","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"36","viewCount":"5970"}},{"id":"9XGw2_-_GyM","snippet":{"description":"Robert Kiyosaki talks about asset protection.","publishedAt":"2012-10-31T16:57:07Z","tags":["Rich Dad","bankrupt dad","Asset protection","Rich Dad scam","Rich Dad money problem","Robert Kiyosaki Bankruptcy","Rich Dad Scams","Rich Dad Education Scams","Rich Dad Education Scam","TheRichDadChannel"],"title":"Robert Kiyosaki on Asset Protection (1 of 3)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9XGw2_-_GyM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9XGw2_-_GyM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9XGw2_-_GyM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9XGw2_-_GyM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9XGw2_-_GyM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT4M38S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"25","dislikeCount":"8","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"456","viewCount":"39057"}},{"id":"lOEsl5TeJPY","snippet":{"description":"Robert Kiyosaki talks about asset protection.","publishedAt":"2012-10-31T16:55:03Z","tags":["Rich Dad","bankrupt dad","Asset protection","Rich Dad scam","Rich Dad money problem","Robert Kiyosaki Bankruptcy","Rich Dad Scams","Rich Dad Education Scam","Rich Dad Education Scams","TheRichDadChannel"],"title":"Robert Kiyosaki on Asset Protection (2 of 3)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lOEsl5TeJPY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lOEsl5TeJPY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lOEsl5TeJPY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lOEsl5TeJPY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lOEsl5TeJPY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M53S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4","dislikeCount":"6","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"270","viewCount":"19039"}},{"id":"WfAJ_3VzOLY","snippet":{"description":"Robert Kiyosaki talks about asset protection.","publishedAt":"2012-10-31T16:53:31Z","tags":["Rich Dad","bankrupt dad","Asset protection","Rich Dad scam","Rich Dad money problem","Robert Kiyosaki Bankruptcy","Rich Dad Scams","Rich Dad Education Scams","Rich dad Education Scam","TheRichDadChannel"],"title":"Robert Kiyosaki on Asset Protection (3 of 3)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WfAJ_3VzOLY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WfAJ_3VzOLY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WfAJ_3VzOLY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WfAJ_3VzOLY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WfAJ_3VzOLY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M24S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"14","dislikeCount":"2","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"246","viewCount":"15219"}},{"id":"yGLlDdot0Ec","snippet":{"description":"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 querr\u00edas vivir debajo de tus medios?

AliExpress is a great tool to get started with dropshipping and to get a feel for the business model. However, it is not an optimal fulfillment strategy when you start getting a lot of orders and want to provide a good customer experience. Each of these Aliexpress alternatives has a different level of barrier-to-entry and provide different benefits for your business.\n\nThe first method I cover is Oberlo suppliers. Using Oberlo suppliers allows you to avoid going through AliExpress and streamlines your fulfillment by allowing you to one-click order for all your orders. However, the downside is that the products are priced at a markup relative to AliExpress and there can still be processing delays.\n\nThe second alternative I cover is the use of dropshipping agents in China. This is a method that I use personally for my dropshipping stores, and it is very efficient. This is the cheapest method for dropshipping internationally. Dropshipping agents buy in bulk from the source and ship your orders for you. If you have at least 50 orders per day and looking for an agent to help you scale, I recommend EcommOps: www.ecommops.com\n\nThe last alternative that I cover is the use of fulfillment centers. With fulfillment centers, you buy inventory in bulk from AliBaba.com and send it to a fulfillment center. This is the best alternative for building a long-term business, having full control over your inventory and offering fast shipping times. I've used ShipBob.com for one of my stores and had a great experience, allowing me to offer delivery in under 7 days in the US. However, the main downside is that you need to distribute your inventory effectively if you're shipping internationally.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to leave a like and subscribe :)","publishedAt":"2018-11-14T18:00:02Z","tags":["Hayden Bowles","Tanner Planes","Arie Scherson","Beast of Ecom","Jordan Welch","Braden Wuerch","Juan Valdez","Tristan Broughton","James Still","The Realistic Entrepreneur","YOUSE","Trey Cockrum","Malik Mufasa","The Real Zaki","Sebastian Ghiorghiu","Kevin David","Flying Start Online","James Beattie","Markus Evers","Franklin Hatchett"],"title":"Best Alternatives to AliExpress | Dropshipping with an Agent","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BiIRkJiejaM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BiIRkJiejaM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BiIRkJiejaM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BiIRkJiejaM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BiIRkJiejaM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M10S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1029","dislikeCount":"625","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"22179","viewCount":"687121"}},{"id":"FSGq-zEd6dM","snippet":{"description":"\u2705 Notes from the video: https:\/\/gabrielstgermain.ca\/2018\/11\/07\/free-course-facebook-ads\/\n\n\u2705 $1,083,252 in 5 months with one product (full case study): https:\/\/bit.ly\/2X7kAkW\n\n\u2705 Free dropshipping course playlist: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2SrzILl\n\n\u2705 Join the FB Mastermind group: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2QgzYHP\n\n\u2705 Follow me on IG: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/gabrielstger\/\n\nHey everyone! In this free course video, I cover everything you need to know about Facebook Advertising for eCommerce & Dropshipping. \n\n** One thing I forgot to mention in the video is that you should always use website conversions PURCHASE optimization, aside from when you're split testing with worldwide PPE (even with a new pixel.)

I also explain how flex targeting works and why it's useful.\n\nNext, I cover how I split test my creatives using worldwide PPE to find the winning creative and to get social proof\/data.

I also explain my optimization strategies and how to determine when to kill an ad set using your breakeven ROAS.\n\nI also show you how to set up a retargeting funnel using FB ads and give a few more tips to optimize performance and delivery.\n\nLastly, I explain how to scale aggressively using more LAAs and manual bidding.

Specifically, I cover the three main time-consuming tasks that need to be taken care of while running a one-product dropshipping store at scale: customer service, order fulfillment, and marketing.\n\nI start by introducing Zendesk, a powerful customer service software that allows you to stay organized and save time while replying to customer requests. Using Zendesk macros, my customer service representatives can save time replying to tickets. I also cover how to hire customer service representatives from Upwork and how you should structure your team.\n\nNext, I talk about how I automated fulfillment for this store using a dropshipping agent with a direct connection to my store. This reduced my time spent fulfilling orders to zero and eliminates any room for error.\n\nLastly, I cover how I set up automated rules with RevealBot to save time optimizing my ads. I've started using this tool recently and have been impressed with the results. I still have much to learn about automated rules so you can expect dedicated video on that at some point in the future.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, make sure to leave a like and subscribe.

Using this method, I've achieved a success rate of 60% launching products with Facebook Ads.\n\nMy testing method is very different than most and often requires more capital to start out with. However, it allows you to thoroughly test a product and the chances of it eventually becoming profitable are much higher. \n\nI start by explaining what 95% of people do to test products, and why I think that most people fail. In contrast to that, I give an overview of my testing strategy and why I think that it's been so successful for me.\n\nI break down my method into six main steps:\n\n1. Only test products that you KNOW are selling.\n2. Put in extra effort for each product you test by building a branded store, social media pages etc.\n3. Start by testing at LEAST 3 ad variations with a PPE split test\n4. Figure out the demographic (Age range + Gender + Country) by targeting all countries you can ship to & all ages without any interest targeting (WC PUR optimization)\n5. Once you figure out the demographic targeting, use that demographic + single interests to start narrowing down (WC PUR optimization)\n6. Test all LAAs possible as soon as you have enough data (WC PUR optimization)\n\nI cover all of these steps in-depth in the video. To give you a real example of this testing method, I also take you into my ads manager to show you the month-by-month progression of ad account launching a new store with this method.\n\nLastly, I end off the video by outlining the pros and cons of this method.\n\nThanks for watching!

The dropshipping space is evolving very quickly and it's important to stay ahead of the curve if you want to be successful.\n\nThe first point I talk about is niching down. With the amount of awareness around dropshipping nowadays, it's becoming more effective to focus on one product or niche in order to stand out from the storm of general stores advertising on social media. To highlight my point, I show you a comparison of a general store versus a one product store selling the same product so you can see which is more compelling.\n\nThe next point I cover is branding. For the same reasons explained above, it's becoming increasingly important to build a real brand that your customers can trust. This means generating lifestyle content to post on your social media channels, striving to offer faster shipping time, providing excellent customer service etc. To highlight this, I show you an example of a massive brand that does an excellent job at this.\n\nThe last point I cover is multi-channel advertising. With rising ad costs, especially on Facebook, it's become increasingly important to diversify your advertising channels. This means advertising on multiple platforms to avoid having all your eggs in one basket. For example, reaching people for the first time with influencer marketing retargeting them with FB ads.\n\nThanks for watching!

In this video, I show you absolutely everything that you need to know about product research for dropshipping in 2019-2020. Specifically, I cover five different methods to find hot selling products and give an in-depth breakdown of what a winning product looks like based on my experience.\n\nI start by breaking down what a winning product is into four main factors. I also show you an example of a winning product to apply these four factors in practice and help you get a better understanding of what to look for in products.\n\nThen, I show you two different product research methods that use Facebook. The first one involves tailoring your Facebook feed to be shown more ads using a pixel \"hack\". The second one involves searching for common dropshipping keywords to find popular ads. I also show you how to take both these product research methods further by spying on your competitors.\n\nNext, I show you how to do product research using AliExpress. I also show you how to use the AliExpress dropshipping center to get more product suggestions and access in-depth analytics for specific products.\n\nThe fourth product research method I show you involves following Instagram pages that do promotions, which I call \"promo pages\". This allows you to see more ads on Instagram and see which products are constantly being advertised.\n\nLastly, I show you how to use Ecomhunt which is a product curation software. Ecomhunt posts two new products every day which are proven to sell well. This is the \"lazy\" product research method that allows you to stay up to date with recent winning products without having to go through the other methods I talk about in this video.\n\nEcomhunt: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2O6IbMZ\n\nThanks for watching :) If you found this video helpful, please leave a thumbs up and subscribe \ud83d\ude4f I try to post one new value-packed video like this one every week. \n\nIf you made it this far in the description, leave a comment below telling me what you want to see next, I would really appreciate it!","publishedAt":"2018-12-26T17:53:08Z","tags":["Hayden Bowles","Tanner Planes","Arie Scherson","Beast of Ecom","Jordan Welch","Braden Wuerch","Juan Valdez","Tristan Broughton","James Still","The Realistic Entrepreneur","YOUSE","Trey Cockrum","Malik Mufasa","The Real Zaki","Sebastian Ghiorghiu","Kevin David","Flying Start Online","James Beattie","Markus Evers","Franklin Hatchett","Verum Ecom","Chris Conrady"],"title":"Ultimate Product Research Guide | How to Find Hot Dropshipping Products","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A_whelT7XkI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A_whelT7XkI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A_whelT7XkI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A_whelT7XkI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A_whelT7XkI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT27M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1988","dislikeCount":"200","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"22244","viewCount":"609092"}},{"id":"5PRGNVSIv6Y","snippet":{"description":"\u2705 Notes from the video: https:\/\/gabrielstgermain.ca\/2019\/02\/16\/troubleshooting-facebook-ads\/\n\n\u2705 $1,083,252 in 5 months with one product (case study course): https:\/\/bit.ly\/2X7kAkW\n\n\u2705 Free dropshipping course playlist: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2SrzILl\n\n\u2705 Recommended fulfillment service (50+ orders per day): https:\/\/ecommops.com\n\n\u2705 Join the FB Mastermind group: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2QgzYHP\n\nHey everyone!\n\nIn this video, I\u2019m going to try my best to answer a question that I get asked a lot: \u201cWhen should you stop a failing store?\u201d.\n\nSince my strategy is to take a proven product, create a one-product store for it, and essentially force it to work through extensive testing, a lot of people wonder at which point they should give up on a store that isn\u2019t profitable.\n\nI start by explaining my minimal testing framework, which is the minimum amount of testing I will typically do for one product. This includes testing different creatives, lookalike audiences, & single interests.\n\nThen, I explain how you can see if a campaign has potential at first glance, and what you should do to troubleshoot a campaign that clearly isn't working.\n\nI also explain how you can optimize your campaigns & save budget by quickly pausing bad adsets, using your breakeven CPP or CPATC as a pass-fail criterion.\n\nLastly, I explain how you can go from breaking even on a store to being profitable through compounding improvements in your funnel. This is extremely powerful and has the potential to turn a failing store upside down.\n\nAt the end of the video, I mention my new case study based course that launched about a week ago... Since launching, seeing the student results inside the private group has been nothing short of amazing. \n\nIf you've already seen my free content and you understand my strategy, I truly believe that seeing this case study will make everything click.\n\nIf you're interested, you can check out more details here: https:\/\/www.ecomblueprint.net\/\n\nThanks for watching!

I cover two different methods that you can use to get your products private labeled and take your brand to the next level.\n\nI start by showing you an example of what your end goal could be with a private label brand. I explain how you can start by dropshipping and eventually transition to being a private label.\n\nThe first method involves using a sourcing agent to handle the private labeling for you. For this method, it helps to already be working with an agent for dropshipping. If you're currently average 50+ orders\/day, I can connect you with my agent that helped me private label my new brand, just send me a DM @gabrielstger.\n\nThe second method involves using a third-party fulfillment center such as ShipBob, and buying private label inventory in bulk from AliBaba.

The biggest expense is the marketing that you need to drive traffic to your site.\n\nI talk about 2 different marketing strategies you can use based on your starting budget: one strategy for a low budget, one strategy for a higher budget.\n\nFor low starting budgets (~$200), I recommend starting with Instagram page influencers instead of Facebook Ads. This is what I did when I first got into dropshipping and it really helped me build up some capital to take things to the next level.\n\nLearn more about this strategy: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tzjSFsNjBlc\n\nFor higher starting budgets (~$2000), i'd recommend jumping right into Facebook Ads for long-term consistency. However, you must be willing to burn some money testing with Facebook Ads especially if you are a complete beginner.\n\nLearn more about this strategy: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wA0E0g5Tuyo\n\nThanks for watching!

Then, I dive into my backend analytics to show you the stats I've been getting with this setup.\n\nAfter covering the basics, I dive into my advertising strategy and explain how I took the store from $1-2k\/day to $15k\/day in just a few days. I break it down into two parts:\n\n1. Testing phase: This is where the magic happens. I explain my process for testing new creatives, and give you an overview of the most significant tests I ran for this store. I also break down the \"formula\" for my winning creative.\n\n2. Scaling phase: This is the easiest (and most exciting) part. I explain how I scaled my winning ads with CBO campaigns and take you inside my ads manager to give you a day-by-day overview. If you haven't watched my latest video on CBO strategies, I'd recommend checking it out first to take full advantage of this section: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T0RtYNxNHHs\n\nLastly, I cover some tips on how to maintain consistency while scaling. \n\nIf you are curious about how I'm running the operations for this store and automating most the work, check out this video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=13gMJC6Uadw \n\nThanks for watching!

These markets have less competition, mainly due to the language barrier (the majority dropshippers only focus on English speaking countries).\n\nHere's what I cover in the video: quick strategy overview, untapped markets with the most potential, how to translate your store\/ads, and more. I also take you inside my ads manager to show you exactly how I launched the German store.\n\n*** A few important things that I forgot to mention in the video:\n- Make sure to research the regulations & tax laws for the country you are selling to avoid legal issues. For the EU, you're legally required to register for VAT, and it's not cheap so keep that in mind as you pick a market. Germany also has a lot of strict laws for eCommerce, so make sure to familiarize yourself with them before attempting this strategy.\n- You should charge your customers in their local currency to increase trust. That is why the German store I showed in the video charges in Euro.\n- Ideally, you should get your brand domain name with the local extension (i.e. \".de\" for Germany, \".fr\" for France... etc)\n- Even if a lot of the population speaks English as a secondary language (i.e. Sweden, Norway...), making a store in the local language appears more trustworthy & will get higher conversion rates\n\nIf you want to see a more in-depth case study on this brand, check out this recent video: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aK6QyCGt2rQ\n\nThanks for watching!

Copy Blogger). \n\nThe process is quite simple: \n\nFirst, you can search for a domain in Ahrefs\u2019 Site Explorer. (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/site-explorer)\n\nFrom here, you can navigate to the broken links report which will find all websites that returned a \u2018404 not found error.\u2019\n\nYes, the page is dead!\n\nYou can then filter down the report to only show DoFollow links. This will likely bring up websites that used to be quality pieces of content from a blog that are wasting link juice. \n\nMake sure that the page is indeed broken and then use archive.org to see what the page looked like prior to it being a dead link.\n\nYou can now create a page or blog post on a similar topic and begin your outreach process to create backlinks for your website. \n\nThe real SEO trick isn\u2019t to get a backlink to your site from one link prospect.\n\nThe magic happens when you find ALL backlinks pointing to the dead page.\n\nIn the video example, the target URL had numerous referring domains pointing to it, which could result in a ton of links to your site.\n\nNo matter what industry you\u2019re in, there will be websites that have broken links.

But there\u2019s an easy way to find and fix all of these SEO issues.\nSubscribe: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ahrefscom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nUsing Ahrefs\u2019 broken link checker reports, you can find both of these fast.\n\nNote: This tool is a part of Ahrefs\u2019 Site Explorer tool which also lets you see a website\u2019s backlink profile and the organic keywords a website ranks for. More details here: \n\nhttps:\/\/ahrefs.com\/site-explorer\n\nSo what\u2019s the difference between a broken link and a broken backlink? \n\nA broken link is when a page on your website is linking to some other page that no longer exists. This is bad for two reasons: \n\n1. It\u2019s creates a bad user experience. When people click a link on your website, they\u2019re redirected to content that no longer exists. \n\n2. Google checks every link on your page. Once it sees that some of them lead them nowhere, it will value your page less because it\u2019s apparently linking to some really outdated pages. \n\nA broken backlink is when another site is linking to a page on your website that no longer exists. \n\nThis kind of link doesn\u2019t send you any link juice or help you to rank better in Google\u2019s search results. \n\nTo fix broken links, you can update your pages with more up to date resources, or remove them completely.\n\nFor broken backlinks, you have a couple of options.\n\nFirst, you can recreate the page that was previously on your website so the backlinks are no longer broken.\n\nIf the page is no longer relevant, you can create a 301 redirect that links back to another relevant page on your website. \n\nThis way, you will continue to maintain some of the link equity. \n\nFor more great SEO tutorials, make sure to subscribe to Ahrefs\u2019 YouTube channel. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\n\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts\nYouTube channel \u25bahttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1","publishedAt":"2015-09-15T10:06:43Z","tags":["Broken links","Broken backlinks","Broken link checker","Broken link building","How to check broken links","How to find broken links in a website","search engine optimization","SEO","Tim Soulo","oseo","Ahrefs","Ahref"],"title":"How To Find Broken Links And Broken Backlinks That Hurt Your SEO [OSEO-08]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/79NQlL6c8w8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/79NQlL6c8w8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/79NQlL6c8w8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/79NQlL6c8w8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/79NQlL6c8w8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M2S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"25","dislikeCount":"13","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"163","viewCount":"42601"}},{"id":"WJG-4THsYMo","snippet":{"description":"Want to rank higher than your competitors?

Well, that's what this tutorial shared by Nate Shivar is all about!\n\nSo, if you are aiming to improve your content strategy and want to know what type of content gets lots of links, you may:\n\n1) perform a competitive analysis, dropping your competitors into a backlinks checker like Ahrefs Site Explorer (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/site-explorer), see what works well for them and then just replicate it;\n\n2) take giant publishers (newspapers, magazines) complementary to your industry and perform a content analysis of what's working for them and use that to build up your own content strategy, to avoid wasting time on content that is not going to perform.\n\nYour actions in this case are pretty straightforward:\n\n1) take their main domain and drop it to Ahrefs Site Explorer;\n\n2) go to the Top Content report and sort the results by links;\n\n3) find specific examples of content that has done really well and has got lots of links, check who is actually linking to those pieces of content and see if this is the type of content that you want. \n\nYou will most probably get thousands of results, so it's recommended to check the top 50-100. This way you'll cherry-pick the most successful pieces of content and may then put your own spin or your own angle on it and make it work for your own content strategy.\n\nThat is a quick and easy way to find out what type of content is going to work really well in the industry.\n\nIf not links, but social signals are your goal, you may sort results by that, see what does well, reverse-engineer it, put your own spin on it, and this way you'll get a much better chance to succeed than you would just throwing darts into the dark.\n\nSTAY TUNED:\n\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts\nYouTube channel \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWquNQV8Y0_defMKnGKrFOQ?sub_confirmation=1","publishedAt":"2015-10-25T05:27:42Z","tags":["Search Engine Optimization (Interest)","Ahrefs"],"title":"How To \u201cSteal\u201d Viral Content Ideas From Giant Publishers [ATM-05 by Nate Shivar]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-aMFeVAfhIg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-aMFeVAfhIg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-aMFeVAfhIg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-aMFeVAfhIg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-aMFeVAfhIg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT6M2S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"32","viewCount":"2842"}},{"id":"cIPZ3-KnH9A","snippet":{"description":"A smart way to do keyword research is to find keywords that your competitors rank for and use them to get more organic traffic.

In this tutorial Nate Shivar will show you how to reverse-engineer reference sites - websites that get more links from almost all the sites on the Internet, like Wikipedia.\n\nOne of the biggest problems in creating content is creating content that is \"linkable\". And that means two things:\n\n1) the content has to be something that people want TO link to;\n\n2) the content should appeal to the people who CAN link.\n\nWhat would be the solution to this problem? Finding websites in your industry that get links and reverse-engineering them! And which resource is getting links from almost every site on the Internet? It's Wikipedia! \n\nHere's how you can use Wikipedia for creating content that is linkable:\n\n1) find a piece of content on Wikipedia in your industry that provides definitions or lots of information on a technical term or technical topic, something where Wikipedia is a reference piece (you can then reverse-engineer it providing content that is more engaging, or user-friendly, or simply better and more authoritative than a Wikipedia enrty);\n\n2) drop this URL in Ahrefs Site Explorer (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/site-explorer) using 'prefix' mode and pull the 'Links' report. To near the number of results you get down, you may filter them by Backlink Type or go to 'Referring Domains' and group all these links by referring domain to see what types of sites are linking to this Wikipedia page. \n\nBut the best way to quickly find the most valuable types of links is to go to the 'Top Referring Content' report that looks at the number of shares, links for each result and guesses the amount of traffic all those links are sending to our Wikipedia entry.\n\n3) look at the results you've got in the 'Top Referring Content' report \"through the marketer's lens,\" analysing the types of content and the audience that is linking out.\n\nYou can also apply this approach if you are in the industry that has a Wikipedia-like reference, being a publicational giant or a definition site everyone uses, like Investopedia. Pick the topic and check chosen Investopedia page in Site Explorer looking at 'Links' or 'Top Referring Content' report to find writers and journalists who are writing about the same topic. You can do two things now:\n\n1) create content that they are more likely to link to;\n\n2) scrape these posts, find the journalists who are writing this content and use them to prioritise your PR outreach.\n\nSo, this is how you can use Site Explorer together with major industry resources like Wikipedia or Investopedia and build linkable assets!\n\nSTAY TUNED:\n\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts\nYouTube channel \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWquNQV8Y0_defMKnGKrFOQ?sub_confirmation=1","publishedAt":"2015-10-20T05:41:17Z","tags":["Reverse Engineering (Software Genre)","Search Engine Optimization (Interest)","Ahrefs"],"title":"Reverse Engineering \u201cLinkable\u201d Content of Authority Sites [AMS-04 by Nate Shivar]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ht9L2LXdDI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ht9L2LXdDI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ht9L2LXdDI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ht9L2LXdDI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ht9L2LXdDI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M30S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"0","dislikeCount":"3","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12","viewCount":"1639"}},{"id":"n458LcMzqQg","snippet":{"description":"On-page SEO optimization is not a rocket science, actually.

Sounds simple, right? There is actually a bit more to it. Let's take a look at the example! - https:\/\/blog.ahrefs.com\/the-basics-of-on-page-seo\/\n\nSo, what are the on-page SEO basics?\n\nIf you want to optimize your page for a certain keyword you have to put it to four different places:\n\n -   URL of the page (or maybe even your domain name);\n -   Title of the page;\n -   Heading (H1 tag);\n -   Content.\n\nWhat can you do with this knowledge? Open Ahrefs Site Explorer tool (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/site-explorer), put your domain name there, go to the 'Top Pages' report and then to the 'Backlinks' tab.\n\nYou'll get a list of the top pages of your site in terms of the backlinks they have.\n\nOpen those pages one by one to see if each of them is perfectly optimized for a certain keyword you wish to rank for.\n\nOnce you do that to at least 20-30 top pages of your site, you will surely see the increase of the traffic that you get from Google.\n\nThis is how you can easily optimize the pages on your site and enjoy the increase in traffic!\n\nSTAY TUNED:\n\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts\nYouTube channel \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWquNQV8Y0_defMKnGKrFOQ?sub_confirmation=1","publishedAt":"2015-10-13T23:39:25Z","tags":["Search Engine Optimization (Interest)"],"title":"The Basics Of On-Page SEO [OSEO-12]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n458LcMzqQg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n458LcMzqQg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n458LcMzqQg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n458LcMzqQg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n458LcMzqQg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6","dislikeCount":"13","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"66","viewCount":"34499"}},{"id":"RNYp2byMdIY","snippet":{"description":"Why would you want to find the best content of your competitors?

Why? There are at least four simple reasons for that:\n\n  1)  To see which of your marketing efforts are bringing you results;\n\n  2)  To see if someone is linking to you naturally and if it makes sense to connect with that person;\n\n  3)  To keep an eye on the SEO agency that you\u2019ve hired to build links for you;\n\n  4)  To protect yourself from possibe \u201cNegative SEO\u201d attacks (even though they\u2019re very rare actually).\n\nSo, whether you want to see if there was anyone new linking to your site recently or check if any of your backlinks were lost, go to Ahrefs Site Explorer (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/site-explorer), type your domain name, and click 'SEARCH'.\n\nReferring Domains - New report within Inbound Links menu will show you if there were any new websites linking to your site (during the last 60 days) that have never linked to you before.\n\nThis way you may also easily check reports on New Backlinks, as well as Lost Backlinks and Referring Domains in the corresponding tabs of Site Explorer tool.\n\nHowever, checking all these 4 reports every day might not be very convenient.

If you manage to approach a blogger almost the same day when his article was published and ask him to add something relevant to you, the chances that he will update his article are very big. But if you wait for a month or more and then approach him, he will hardly do it, cause he is most probably not interested in this topic anymore. \n\nSo how do you actually keep an eye on such stuff? One of the best ways is to get an email alert every time someone publishes a piece of content related to your niche. And you are surely familiar with Google Alerts tool (https:\/\/www.google.com\/alerts) that does just that. \n\nBut are you really satisfied with the quality of these alerts from Google? Here at Ahrefs we've created an alternative tool - Content Alerts (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/user\/alerts) available within Ahrefs Dashboard. It is a powerful marketing tool which helps you to connect with influencers who publish content online.\n\nWith its help, whenever someone publishes an article about your topic of interest, you get immediately notified about it.

Let's recall them real brief!\n\nStrategy #1: Creating linkable assets - this is when you create a piece of content so good that people just can't help linking to it. The true masters of this craft are Brian Dean, guys from MOZ and Neil Patel. We all should learn from these guys!\n\nStrategy #2: Guest blogging - yes, it's not dead! You can still land awesome backlinks with your guest articles. But creating good content consistently might be quite challenging. So just follow 'the Robin Hood technique' and you are sure to get a lot of backlinks quite easily!\n\nStrategy #3: Broken link building - this strategy has been around for years! To be honest, it requires a lot of effort and the success is pretty low, however this may be your only chance to land a backlink from some high-authority site, which is definitely worth a try.\n\nStrategy #4: Monitoring your niche - quite often perfect timing is really all you need to land a backlink, so if you monitor your niche closely and immediately reach out to people once you see them publish something relevant, you'll create lots of link opportunities for yourself.\n\nStrategy #5: Link intersect - the main idea behind this strategy is: if some site is linking to all your competitors, but not you, he most likely haven't heard about you yet. So to land a backlink from this site you only need to reach out and let him know that you exist. And there's actually a handy tool for that ;)\n\nStrategy #6: Competitor research - if you want to outrank someone, just check what sites link to him and try to get backlinks from all these sites. This sounds simple in theory, but in reality it's pretty hard to do.\n\nThat was our Lnk Building 101.

Go to Ahrefs Positions Explorer tool (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/positions-explorer), put the URL of your site here to check the keywords your site is already ranking for and what kind of opportunities you have for it!\n\nSTAY TUNED:\n\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts\nYouTube channel \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWquNQV8Y0_defMKnGKrFOQ?sub_confirmation=1","publishedAt":"2015-12-01T07:11:37Z","tags":["OSEO","Ahrefs","Search Engine Optimization (Interest)"],"title":"How to find the keywords to rank for [OSEO-19]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aUR1e8vO55A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aUR1e8vO55A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aUR1e8vO55A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aUR1e8vO55A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aUR1e8vO55A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT6M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"7","dislikeCount":"2","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"40","viewCount":"5040"}},{"id":"MJG4LKUGcrU","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial - full process at https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/broken-link-building\/ - I will show you how to find high quality backlink opportunities by looking for broken outbound links using Ahrefs Site Explorer.\n\nStep 1: Find A List Of Popular Blogs\n\nGo to Google and search for popular blogs in your niche. In this example I searched for \"best healthy eating blogs 2015\" and clicked on the first result.\n\nGrab the URL of a blog you would like to get a link from.\n\nStep 2: Put The URL Into Ahrefs Site Explorer\n\nEnter the URL you copied into Ahrefs Site Explorer and hit search.\n\nStep 3: Go To Outgoing Links, Broken Links\n\nThis will show you all pages on the domain which have broken outgoing links.\n\nIn this example Ahrefs has found 583 pages with broken links.\n\nStep 4: Filter Out NoFollow Links\n\nTo start with, use the \"link type\" filter to show only dofollow links. These are more likely to be high quality, editorial links.\n\nStep 5: Check Out One Of The Pages With Broken Links\n\nClick through to one of the pages with broken links to verify that the links are broken.\n\nYou can use a chrome extension such as 'Check My Links' to quickly confirm this.\n\nStep 5: Create Your Own Resource To Replace The Broken Link\n\nWhen you find a broken link, go ahead and create a similar piece of content that you can offer as an alternative. The higher quality you can make this post, the more chance you will have of picking up quality backlinks.\n\nStep 6: Find All Links Pointing To The Broken Resource\n\nIn our example there were 66 backlinks pointing to the broken URL. Once you have created your similar content you'll want to reach out to as many of these as possible to pick up more links.\n\nStep 7: Set Filter To Show NoFollow Sites\n\nThese will be likely to be comment links to sites which are no longer active\/expired.\n\nAgain, you can check to see which sites are linking to these expired domains and reach out to them advising of the broken link and offering your site as an alternative.\n\nAs you can see, from just one site we can potentially find hundreds of potential quality backlink opportunities.\n\nStep 8: Repeat The Process\n\nGo back to your original list of top sites in your niche and repeat the process!\n\nSee more at https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/broken-link-building\/\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts\nYouTune channel \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWquNQV8Y0_defMKnGKrFOQ?sub_confirmation=1","publishedAt":"2016-04-06T23:44:59Z","tags":["seo","link building","broken link building","backlinks","quality backlinks"],"title":"How To Find High Quality Backlink Opportunities with Ahrefs","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MJG4LKUGcrU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MJG4LKUGcrU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MJG4LKUGcrU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MJG4LKUGcrU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"15","dislikeCount":"12","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"85","viewCount":"11165"}},{"id":"krzF3YhmSMw","snippet":{"description":"Ahrefs.com is a well-known SEO tool provider boasting the world's largest index of live backlinks that is updated with fresh data every 15-30 minutes.\nhttps:\/\/ahrefs.com\n\nOur software includes 6 primary SEO tools and several subsets.

This report helps you find your top competitors and lists the sites that rank for the same keywords as your target website.\n\n\"Common\" shows you how many unique keywords the two sites have, \"Unique\" shows you the number of keywords unique to that website - whether yours or your competitor's. So you get a side-by-side comparison of your site and each competitor.\n\n From this list choose your competitors\u2019 websites you want to research for content and traffic wins.\n\nStep #2 Find pages worth replicating\n\nAnalyze each of the competitors on your list to find the pages that get a lot of organic traffic that you could replicate on your site.\n\nGo to the Overview page to see each competitor. You might be tempted to go to the \"Organic keywords\" report which lists all of the keyword phrases that a site ranks for.\n\nBut since you are looking for pages to replicate, using the \"Top pages\" report will provide better results.\n\nThis report gives you the same information as the \"Organic keywords\" report, but is organized by the pages rather than the keywords.\n\nResults here are sorted by the monthly search traffic and you can easily see how many keywords each page ranks for.\n\nNext, select a page that is worth replicating.\n\nStep #3 Analyze the page's referring domains and website traffic\n\nYou can easily get the monthly traffic, the number of referring domains, and the top keywords for each page from the \"Top pages\" report.\n\nWhy do we need this information? Because without backlinks your page won't rank and you won't be able to get as much traffic, as your competitors get.\n\nThis step is critical for link building and getting backlinks from websites that your competitors have previously earned them from.\n\nStep #4 Prioritize your workflow\n\nBegin with the articles that have a lot of traffic, but a low number of referring domains.\n\nThen you can progress to the articles that have more referring domains, which will need more time and effort for link building.\n\nAlways remember:\n\nreplicating a page is just half of this SEO strategy. The other half is building backlinks. So you can not only \"steal\" traffic from your competitors, but possibly outrank them, too. \n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2016-11-09T00:58:50Z","tags":["Organic traffic","get more organic traffic","Increase organic traffic","Competitor analysis","SEO Traffic","Rank in Google","Rank on Google","Rank higher in Google","Rank high in Google","Copying backlinks","Link building","Build backlinks","Get Backlinks","Backlinks","Spy on competitors","Outrank competitors","competitor traffic","Spy on competitor\u2019s backlinks","Steal traffic from other sites","Ahrefs tutorial","How to use Ahrefs","Site explorer","Top pages","Ahrefs"],"title":"How to Steal Organic Search Traffic From Your Competitors","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E5KVlNQ-H6k\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E5KVlNQ-H6k\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E5KVlNQ-H6k\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E5KVlNQ-H6k\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E5KVlNQ-H6k\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"18","dislikeCount":"18","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"226","viewCount":"18203"}},{"id":"lWrbSPb0YoQ","snippet":{"description":"This keyword research tutorial goes beyond search volumes and shows you how to find low competition keywords using Ahrefs\u2019 Keywords Explorer tool. \n\nhttps:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer\n\nAs shown in the video, not all keyword phrases should be chosen based on the volume. You should also focus on the number of clicks that it attracts. \n\nDoing this can help you find some easy keywords that you can potentially rank for within a month or two. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s done: \n\nStep 1: Find tons of great keyword ideas with the help of Ahrefs\u2019 powerful Keywords Explorer tool.\n\nEnter one or two top-level terms related to your website and click the search button. \n\nNext, scroll down to see a section of keyword ideas - \u201chaving same terms.\u201d You can click to view the full report and you\u2019ll see the list ordered by search volume.\n\nStep 2: Find the best keyword opportunities for you. \n\nWant to know what metrics can help you find the best keyword opportunities? \n\nWell, search volume is one. But the second is for sure Keyword Difficulty score. \n\nKeywords Explorer tool has a keyword difficulty checker which shows you a score that can easily be refreshed by clicking on the \u201cGet metrics\u201d. \n\nUnder each term, you can also see a few icons that show you what people see in Google\u2019s SERPs. \n\nStep 3: Researching the number of backlinks from referring domains you need.\n\nBased on the KD reported for a keyword, you can identify how many backlinks you need to rank in the top 10 for this keyword.\n\nScroll down to the SERPs overview where you see all the top ranking pages with the number of referring domains reported for each of the page.\n\nStep 4: Reviewing clicks and clicks per search.\n\nTraditionally we use search volume to determine how much traffic a keyword could send to your page if you rank well for this keyword.\n\nBut just because people search for a term does not mean they click on the results.\n\nThat is why we've developed a \"Clicks\" metric: you can use to confirm that a keyword doesn't just have a high search volume, but can actually send traffic to your page.\n\nInstead of finding keywords with high search Volume and assuming they'll send you a lot of traffic, you can verify that the term actually gets clicked in the SERPs. So you know for sure how much traffic you can get from it.\n\nNow you know how important it is to add \"Clicks\" to the search metrics you review when picking your best keyword opportunities and how to create a list of the easy keywords that you can possibly rank for in just a few months!\n\nGive it a shot and be sure to subscribe to Ahrefs\u2019 YouTube channel for more actionable SEO tutorials. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25bahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2016-12-05T04:25:55Z","tags":["Keyword research","Keyword research tutorial","Keyword research for SEO","How to do keyword research","Keyword difficulty","SEO","ahrefs keyword research","how to use ahrefs for keyword research","Keywords explorer","Keyword explorer","Ahrefs","Ahref"],"title":"Basic Keyword Research Tutorial: Find Low Competition Keywords with Ahrefs Keywords Explorer","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lWrbSPb0YoQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lWrbSPb0YoQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lWrbSPb0YoQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lWrbSPb0YoQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lWrbSPb0YoQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"24","dislikeCount":"11","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"374","viewCount":"26120"}},{"id":"EBgguPTAPkc","snippet":{"description":"This video shows you an A-Z keyword research tutorial using Ahrefs\u2019 SUPER powerful Keywords Explorer tool.\nhttps:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer\n\nTim Soulo will teach you: \n\n1.)

This tutorial shows you the basics of doing search engine optimization for your website to rank high in Google.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFirst, what is SEO and how does it work?\n\nSEO stands for search engine optimization. By definition, it is the process of optimizing your website and webpages to get \u201cfree\u201d, \u201corganic\u201d traffic from search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing.\n\nAs a business owner, blogger, or website owner, your job is two-fold: \n\nFirst, you need to make it easy for search engines to understand what your page is about and create content that matches what we call, the \u201csearcher\u2019s intent.\u201d \n\nSecond, you need to show Google and other search engines that your pages are \u2018worthy\u2019 of ranking.\n\nIn this video, Sam Oh teaches the a 101 into the world of search engine optimization.\n\nThere are plenty of clear examples and some basic (yet powerful) SEO tips to optimize a brand new website to rank #1 on Google (step-by-step).\n\nThe techniques that are taught in this SEO training include: \n\n1. Keyword research \nBy doing keyword research, you can see the average number of times someone searches for a specific keyword phrase in Google each month.\n\nOften times, the query that you think will be the most popular is often far from the truth.\n\nUsing tools like Ahrefs Keywords Explorer (https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer), you\u2019ll learn how to use the \u201cparent topic\u201d of a term to determine the best keywords to target for your pages.\n\nYou\u2019ll also learn what not to do (ie. keyword stuffing). \n\nKeyword research gives you clues on the language you should use to let both Google and potential customers know what our page is about.\n\nThere are a few vivid examples in here to illustrate the best practices on how to do keyword research. If you want to sharpen your keyword research skills, I highly recommend watching this series on doing keyword research in 2018 and beyond. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3zLBu_NfOaQ&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tIF-QrFD854Mnb8D4Av5vx\n\n2. On-page SEO\nOn-page SEO is the process of optimizing web pages with the intention to rank high in Google. If you want to rank #1 on Google, then your on-page SEO will need to be right on.\n\nIn this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn 4 simple, yet highly effective tips to ensure you are following Google SEO best practices. Having optimized web pages will set the foundation for your success in search engine optimization.\n\nIt will help Google understand what your content is about and help your customers find you.\n\nA few of the basic tips include:\n\n- Title tags \n- Meta descriptions\n- Heading tags (or H1 tags)\n- keyword usage\n- content creation\n- competitor analysis\n\nLearn more about our top 10 on-page SEO tips that actually work in 2018 and beyond. \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZWiNz-7gZ24&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2s-OV4MiYXV8yhUjKYtW_bm&index=6\n\n3. Off-page SEO\nOff-page SEO is often referred to as link building.\n\nLink building is the process of getting other websites to link to your web pages. \n\nBasically, links act as \u201cvotes\u201d or other people vouching for your website.\n\nBacklinks work in a similar way that you would refer your friend to buy a product from your favorite store because you\u2019ve tried it, used it, and loved it.\n\nIn general, the more quality backlinks you can get from relevant pages, the higher you\u2019ll rank in Google.\n\nSam will show you how to find backlink opportunities and the key technique that SEOs use to build links, which is through email outreach.\n\nI highly recommend watching our video series on competitor backlink analysis and link building here: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Io4ugroDedo&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2vQNygbg5Uo1sMDs8aqRc4z\n\nWe also have another playlist on more \"advanced\" link building. \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ovu2ZYWgOJQ&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to learn with SEO marketing and we're constantly adding new tutorials to help you learn and execute SEO in effective ways.\n\nContents:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:18 What is SEO?\n2:43 Find keywords that are relevant to your niche\n5:56 Optimize title tags and meta-descriptions\n11:00 Do Off-page SEO\n12:12 Use outreach and guest-posting to build links\n15:44 Start a blog and create useful content\n18:30 Pick topics that provide value to your business\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable tutorials and grow your SEO and marketing knowledge.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\n\n#SEO #SearchEngineOptimization #SEOTutorial","publishedAt":"2018-06-25T11:45:01Z","tags":["SEO","SEO 2018","learn seo","seo training","seo for beginners","seo tutorial for beginners","seo tutorial for beginners step by step","what is seo","search engine optimization tutorial","search engine optimization","seo tutorial","tutorial seo","seo ranking","website seo","seo tips","seo optimization","google seo","how to seo","seo basics","how to do seo","seo marketing","seo optimization tutorial","seo google","seo 101","what is seo and how does it work","seo checklist"],"title":"SEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvwS7cV9GmQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvwS7cV9GmQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvwS7cV9GmQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvwS7cV9GmQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvwS7cV9GmQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1005","dislikeCount":"539","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"18498","viewCount":"943996"}},{"id":"yWLD9139Ipc","snippet":{"description":"With over 130 trillion pages in Google\u2019s search index, this tutorial shows you how to use Google advanced search operators like a pro with 9 actionable tips and tricks for marketers.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGoogle\u2019s job is to provide users with the most relevant search results.

Some of these topics will have tens of thousands of long-tail variations and ranking for the head term can result in potentially hundreds of thousands of search visitors each month to a single page. \n\nBucket #2 is called \u201cTopical Long Tail Keywords.\u201d\n\nThe long-tail keywords in this group are generally based on more focused topics (ie. \u201csqueeze pages\u201d). They have fewer long-tail variations, and may not produce as much search traffic as the first group.\n\nHowever, they are generally lower-competition keywords that will likely be easier to rank for.\n\nThis video breaks down each bucket so you can enhance your keyword research to create content that can send you a torrent of free organic search traffic.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:46 What are long-tail keywords?\n2:31 Two \u201cbuckets\u201d of long-tail keywords\n3:17 Find long-tail keywords of the broad topic\n7:59 Choose topical long-tail keywords\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2018-09-19T15:45:01Z","tags":["long tail keywords","long tail keyword","long tail","long tail keyword research","what are long tail keywords","what is a long tail keyword","how to find long tail keywords","long tail keywords tool","find long tail keywords","long tail keyword phrase","long tail keywords examples","keyword research","seo","ahrefs","long tail keyword phrases","search engine optimization","seo keywords","keyword research 2018"],"title":"How to Choose Long Tail Keywords For Explosive Search Traffic","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/a6sqyOh0Njc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/a6sqyOh0Njc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/a6sqyOh0Njc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/a6sqyOh0Njc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/a6sqyOh0Njc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"218","dislikeCount":"40","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1502","viewCount":"69574"}},{"id":"pgi6Z9GH6rc","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to set up Google alerts to automate 8 SEO and marketing tasks.\nSubscribe \u25bahttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nGoogle Alerts is a free tool that allows you to monitor the web for mentions of keywords and phrases.

This tutorial shows you how to do it efficiently as a link building technique.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThis link building strategy isn\u2019t difficult to execute and follows a simple 3-step process. \n\n1. You need to find websites to pitch your guest post ideas to. \n2. Find topics to write about. \n3. Write content and get it approved\/published on their blog, ideally with a link back to your site. \n\nBut is guest posting worth the effort? Well, we regularly use this link building strategy at Ahrefs and see it as one of the staples to build quality links to your website. \n\nAnd even if you think that link building is useless, guest blogging comes with additional benefits. \n\nYou can be a guest blogger on larger sites to gain exposure and build authority in your niche. This is good to both generate referral traffic to your blog and build your personal brand. \n\nSome of the largest publications like Forbes and the Huffington Post use guest bloggers to fuel their websites. And it's a win-win for everyone.\n\nAs the writer, you\u2019ll likely get a backlink to a page on your website, and as someone who is accepting the post, you\u2019ll get free content.\n\nTo find websites to pitch, you can go to Google and search for a query like: \n\n\u201cguest post by\u201d \u201cyour topic.\u201d \n\nThis will show you a very relevant list of guest blogging sites you can pitch. And the best part? \n\nYou can pitch them confidently knowing that they have accepted guest posts in the past, even if the site doesn\u2019t have a \u201cwrite for us\u201d page.\n\nBut as a guest blogger, you don\u2019t want to contact any old site.\n\nThere are certain SEO metrics you should look for. Ahrefs\u2019 Domain Rating is a good one to watch out for. This metric represents the overall strength of a website\u2019s backlink profile.\n\nSo if a website has a high DR score, it may be a good \u201ceyeball\u201d indication that the site is worth pitching. \n\nAnother way you can find sites to be a guest author at is to use Ahrefs\u2019 Content Explorer. Just type in a query related to your niche, and you\u2019ll likely find more websites than you can handle.\n\nThe best part about Content Explorer for finding contributor sites is that you have access to some awesome filters. A few of these filters include: \n\n1. One article per domain \u25ba this narrows down the results to only one page per website since you don\u2019t need to pitch the same website multiple times. \n\n2. Domain rating \u25ba if you\u2019re new to guest blogging, then you may want to get practice on less popular websites. You can set a Domain Rating (DR) filter to something like 30-40, which will give you a list of sites that are more likely to accept your content.\n\nAlternatively, if you\u2019re a seasoned expert, you may want to filter for higher DR websites (ie. 50-75). \n\nThe next step is to find topics to blog about. \n\nIn the video tutorial, you\u2019ll learn a few unique techniques. \n\nThe first is the \u201cRobin Hood technique,\u201d which is built around the premise of taking from the rich and giving to the poor.\n\nYou can simply look at what other popular websites are writing about, use those ideas as inspiration, and write your own unique take on it for lesser known websites.\n\nThe second hack is the Splintering technique.\n\nThis method uses the principle of taking large guides that you have already written and \u201csplintering\u201d them off into smaller segments.\n\nFor example, if you have a blog post about \u201cPaleo Dieting,\u201d you can easily split this off into a dozen topics quickly.\n\nThe final step is to actually write the content. This one comes with a big caveat.\n\nIf you want to do it at scale, you\u2019ll likely need a team of freelance writers or an internal team which requires money.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need a team of writers in order to execute a successful guest blogging campaign.\n\nAs you continue to grind through writing these articles, you\u2019ll get better and faster. \n\nFinally, the tutorial ends with some additional guest blogging tips to get the most mileage out of your guest blogs. These are ones that you\u2019ll definitely want to watch so you can incorporate them into your next guest posting campaign. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:45 What is guest posting\/guest blogging?\n1:10 Find guest-posting sites to pitch\n4:37 Find suitable guest-post topics to write about\n7:52 Write your guest post\n8:55 A couple additional tips for guest-posting\n\n#linkbuilding #seo #seotips #seostrategy\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-01-30T16:45:01Z","tags":["guest posting","guest post","guest blogging","guest blog","link building","guest posting sites","guest posting seo","guest posting tutorial","guest posting 2018","guest posting strategies","seo","blogging","how to guest post","guest blogging opportunities","how to guest blog","blogging tips","how to generate traffic to your blog"],"title":"Guest Posting at Scale: Get Tons of High Quality Backlinks","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aQK1Vbgb-RY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aQK1Vbgb-RY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aQK1Vbgb-RY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aQK1Vbgb-RY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aQK1Vbgb-RY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M3S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"144","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1145","viewCount":"38078"}},{"id":"8f4YTubL6cM","snippet":{"description":"Learn how to get powerful backlinks at scale using one of the easiest link building strategies in the book: resource page link building. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nUnique links are tough to build. It requires you to create backlinks from different websites rather than multiple links from the same websites. At Ahrefs, we call them \"Referring Domains.\" \n\nIn general, a link from a unique website will be more powerful than a second or third link from a blog that's already linking to you.\n\nSome skeptics believe that link building is \"useless.\" However, there are countless studies that suggest backlinks are one of Google's #1 SEO ranking factors.\n\nAnd it will likely continue to be important for your SEO strategy in 2019 if you want to rank on Google.\n\nResource page link building is a link building strategy that I highly recommend for beginners to SEO.\n\nAnd even if you\u2019re an SEO expert, you can still use this tactic to get links at scale.\n\nSo what is a \"resource page\" in the world of search engine optimization?\n\nA typical resource page usually lists a bunch of links to helpful resources on a particular topic. \n\nAnd the reason why it\u2019s effective is because unlike a lot of other link building techniques, the intention behind these pages is literally to link to other resources. \n\nSo by reaching out to these pages with solid recommendations, you\u2019re contributing to the purpose of that page.\n\nWhereas, when you try to get editorial backlinks from a blog post, you need to do a little more convincing since their goal is to deliver their own information, rather than link to external resources.\n\nThis link building technique is a simple two-step process.\n\n1. Find resource pages. \n2. Send an email to the person in charge of that page with one or more recommendations from your site. \n\nTo find resource pages, you can do a Google search using Google advanced search operators. Here are a few examples: \n\ninurl:links.html \u201cyour topic\u201d\ninurl:resources.html \u201cyour topic\u201d\ninurl:.com\/resources intitle:\u201dyour topic\u201d\n\nAfter you\u2019ve entered one of these queries in Google, you can use the Scraper for Chrome extension to get the top 100 Google search results. \n\nYou can use this custom XPath code in the scraper extension: \n\/\/div[@class=\"r\"]\/a[1]\/@href\n\nNext, you can use a crawler like Screaming Frog + Ahrefs to get the SEO metrics on all of these URLs. It would be to your advantage to use your Ahrefs account so you can get metrics like Domain Rating and URL rating to get an understanding if these are pages are worth pursuing to get backlinks. \n\nYou can then use Excel or Google Sheets to speed up your backlink analysis and prospecting. A lot of tips and filters are shown in the video to make this very efficient. \n\nNext, you can crawl the URLs of your final prospect list and download the external links on these websites. \n\nFrom here, you can analyze their backlink profiles in bulk with Ahrefs\u2019 Batch Analysis tool or individually in Site Explorer.\n\nJust go to the backlinks report and type a footprint like \u201cresources\u201d in the include search box. \n\nThis will show you all the resource page backlinks that your competitors have gotten. You can then reach out to these websites and get your resources mentioned there too. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:50 What is resource page link building?\n1:47 Find link prospects using Google search operations\n3:20 Analyse your prospects using Screaming Frog and Ahrefs\n6:15 Export the external link on the resource pages\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\n\n#linkbuilding #seostrategy #seo #seotips","publishedAt":"2019-01-23T16:45:01Z","tags":["link building","backlinks","seo backlinks","seo","resource page link building","how to build unique links","get backlinks","rank on google","backlinks 2018","backlinks 2019","resource pages","seo link building","search engine optimization","building link","getting links","link building strategies","link building strategy","off page seo","link building seo","quality backlinks","how to rank in google","white hat link building"],"title":"How to Build Unique Backlinks With Resource Page Link Building","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8f4YTubL6cM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8f4YTubL6cM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8f4YTubL6cM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8f4YTubL6cM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8f4YTubL6cM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"91","dislikeCount":"12","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"523","viewCount":"22541"}},{"id":"oRGUdHlOqI0","snippet":{"description":"We studied ~1 billion pages of content and found two common SEO mistakes holding 91% of pages from ranking on Google. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nHow to Get Backlinks By \u201cStealing\u201d From Low-Quality Pages \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wPjPjNK-bDM\n\nAhrefs' Keywords Explorer \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer\n\nGuest Posting at Scale: Get Tons of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aQK1Vbgb-RY\n\nThe New SEO Toolbar by Ahrefs (and How to Use it) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AyWi352p8NI\n\nHow to Increase Organic Traffic with a Content Audit \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tWNvAGwiVqo\n\nSEO For Beginners Tutorial \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ\n\n\n***************************************\n\nIn addition, we found that 4.5% of pages get less than 10 search visitors each month.\n\nWhile the stats may seem alarming, our data points to two common SEO mistakes to avoid to be in the top 5% of web pages across the entire internet!\n\nThe first SEO mistake we discovered is that pages with no traffic do not have any or many quality backlinks.\n\nIn fact, we found that 55.24% of pages have zero referring domains pointing at them. And 29.79% of pages have backlinks from less than three websites.\n\nSome marketers believe that link building is useless. However we found a clear positive correlation between the number of referring domains pointing at a page and its organic search traffic. \n\nAnd the same goes for the total number of keywords a page ranks for.\n\nBottomline: if you want to get organic traffic to your pages, then you need to build links as it is foundational and an SEO best practice.\n\nThis tutorial covers a couple link building strategies to get backlinks to existing content.\n\nIf you\u2019re relatively new to link building, then we strongly recommended you watch the tutorials in this playlist to sharpen your skills. \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nAIWG8883uo&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nThe second SEO mistake that we saw in pages with no search traffic is that they are not targeting a topic with enough search traffic potential. \n\nEven if you have all the links in the world, but you're not targeting a meaningful keyword with search traffic potential, then you may not be able to reap the passive SEO traffic that\u2019s possible with Google. \n\nThis is one of the biggest mistakes that you'll see news sites doing.\n\nFor example, we found that nearly 30,000 pages had over 200 unique websites linking to them, but had no monthly search traffic whatsoever. \n\nThis was most commonly found in two scenarios. \n\nThe first were pages that went overboard with black hat SEO techniques. And the second type were news websites. \n\nSince news articles are often focused on \u201cclick-worthy\u201d headlines, it can be challenging to ground them behind meaningful keywords. Also, journalists are trained to write, but not necessarily for SEO copywriting. \n\nIf you happen to have pages with a lot of links, but are not gaining search traffic, you'll learn a couple ways to use these pages to increase your organic traffic.\n\nTimestamps:\r\n\n1:01 Mistake #1. Pages don\u2019t have enough quality backlinks\r\n1:58 \u201cSteal\u201d links from the top-ranking pages for your target keyword\r\n2:39 Use guest blogging to get links to pages that need the boost\r\n3:57 Mistake #2.

This tutorial shows how to get more traffic from Google by deleting and redirecting content on your website. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nConventional SEO wisdom will tell you to publish more content to get more traffic. But that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nThere\u2019s an SEO strategy that has gained popularity called a content audit. \n\nIn its simplest form, it\u2019s a way to get rid of underperforming, low-quality pages with the goal to improve the overall \u201chealth\u201d of a website. \n\nThis is generally done by deleting pages (404) or redirecting\/consolidating it with other relevant pieces (301). \n\nBut is deleting content a good idea?\n\nJohn Mueller from Google has said, \n\n\"From my point of view, if you're aware of low-quality pages on your website, then that's something I'd try to fix and find a solution to, be that either removing those pages if you really can't change them or, in the best case, finding a way to make them less low-quality and actually making them useful, good pages on your site\"\n\nHere\u2019s a quick background on the website being audited in this tutorial.\n\nA few years ago, Sam purchased a blog with around 1,000 pages in the sitemap. The topics were so widespread that if he deleted all pages outside of his chosen niche, he would have been left with around 12 pages. \n\nSo the goal of the first round of deleting pages was simple. \n\n \u25ba Delete pages that don\u2019t get a \u201cmeaningful\u201d level of traffic.\n \u25ba Redirect or consolidate pages that don\u2019t get a \u201cmeaningful\u201d level of traffic but have external backlinks.\n \u25ba Manually review pages that are not getting a \u201cmeaningful\u201d level of organic traffic and make some hard decisions. \n\nThis tutorial walks you through various scenarios that you\u2019ll run into should you choose to perform a content audit on your website.\n\nNow, this process can be extremely time consuming and the last thing you want to do is make mistakes and delete pages that are important to your business.\n\nWe created a template that you can download and input data for your own website.\n\n\u2192 How to Use \u2190\nFirst, create your own copy of the template by clicking file - make a copy - save to your drive. \nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1aBp4FjVeiumBCYYwn71mg4YRkeJExigZEbJuFZPVyFU\/edit?usp=sharing\n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to import the following data: \n\n- sitemap URLs\n- traffic data from Google Analytics (watch the tutorial to understand which report and segments) - backlinks data from Ahrefs\u2019 Site Explorer tool (top pages report). \n\nAfter doing that, you\u2019ll have a \u201cmaster\u201d sheet which will give you suggested actions based on your pages\u2019 data.\n\nFrom there, you can manually assess each page and see what the best course of action will be to trim your website of low-quality content. \n\nAfter you\u2019ve deleted and\/or redirected your pages, you\u2019ll need to make the on-page changes to remove all internal links pointing at these pages.\n\nYou can use a tool like Ahrefs\u2019 Site Audit tool, which will help you identify where these internal links are. \n\nTry the template yourself, follow along with the tutorial, and proceed with caution before making any rash decisions.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:00 What is a content audit?\n2:45 Learn how to vet your site\u2019s pages\n4:41 Consider deleting or redirecting some pages\n6:25 Use our template for a content audit\n7:12 Import your sitemap URLs into the spreadsheet\n8:11 Export your GA data and link data over the past year\n11:26 Vet your results taking our action suggestions into account\n\n#organictraffic #seo #seostrategy\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-01-09T16:45:00Z","tags":["organic traffic","seo","increase organic traffic","get more organic traffic","content audit","get more search traffic","seo strategy","get more google traffic","search engine optimization","seo audit","how to run a content audit","content audit template","seo ranking","seo training","seo techniques","increase website traffic","website traffic","improve google rankings","google ranking","online marketing","content marketing","content marketing strategy","digital marketing"],"title":"How to Increase Organic Traffic with a Content Audit","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tWNvAGwiVqo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tWNvAGwiVqo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tWNvAGwiVqo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tWNvAGwiVqo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tWNvAGwiVqo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M52S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"140","dislikeCount":"15","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"563","viewCount":"24612"}},{"id":"kAuM2nQb_P8","snippet":{"description":"Learn the YouTube keyword research tips, tools and processes we use to rank our videos in YouTube search (377% increase in 8 months).\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nVideo Marketing Resources\n\nYouTube SEO: How to Rank Your Videos #1 (Start to Finish) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NY3y0V9UDwM\n\nHow to Edit YouTube Videos for High Engagement \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j5EOWffq-gk\n\n***************************************\n\nYouTube keyword research is a fundamental step to improve your YouTube SEO and get more views consistently to your videos. There are a lot of tools out there, but the fact is that a lot of them are providing inaccurate data.\n\nThe YouTube keyword tools used and recommended in this video include: \n- YouTube search\n- Tubebuddy Tags\n- VidIQ\u2019s Related queries\n- Ahrefs Keywords Explorer\n\nBy doing data-driven keyword research, you\u2019ll have a blueprint to optimize your video titles, descriptions and tags so you can focus your attention on increasing video engagement signals. \n\nHere\u2019s what we covered in this tutorial:\n\n1. How to plan your video SEO efforts before you begin doing keyword research.\nWhen you create videos on topics that are too broad, your YouTube audience will likely be too scattered to make an impact on your business. \n\nBut if you create videos on topics too narrow, then you\u2019re limiting your reach.\n\nThis part of the video shows you how to structure a hierarchy of topics so you don\u2019t get sidetracked. \n\n2. How to generate hundreds (or thousands) of relevant keyword ideas that get searched for in YouTube\nThis section is the meat of the tutorial. You\u2019ll learn important YouTube tips that go against what other so-called \u201cexperts\u201d recommend. \n\nFor example, you shouldn\u2019t rely solely on the total view counts as they can be misleading. One of our videos targeting the keyword \u201cSEO audit\u201d has nearly 600,000 views. But 550,000 of those views come from ads.\n\nThe same could be true for your competitors\u2019 videos.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll learn a process to find topics that continually gets searched for in YouTube.\n\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to expand your list of keyword ideas from your base list of seed keywords. If you follow along, you should have a huge pool of new ideas you can create content on.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll learn how to find trending topics and how to get in on them early. This will increase your chances of \u201criding the trending wave\u201d and potentially to get promoted by YouTube in search, suggested videos, and browse features.\n\n3. How to find topics that rank in Google search AND YouTube.\nAt Ahrefs, we get a ton of views from Google searchers. You\u2019ll learn a couple tricks we\u2019ve been using to find these topics and how we rank our videos on Google to get thousands of additional views each month.\n\n4. Gauging search intent for a keyword\nThis section might seem simple, but it\u2019s arguably the most critical component to keyword research.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that YouTube\u2019s ranking factors are mostly centered around engagement. Whether that be likes, shares, dislikes, comments, subscriptions and watch time, they\u2019re all important. \n\nAnd if you can\u2019t match search intent, then you likely won\u2019t be getting any of that.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn a simple 2-step process to gauge search intent so you can maximize engagement and give your videos the best chance to rank.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:15 Map out a hierarchy of your topics\n2:07 Generate keyword ideas and analyze keyword trends\n4:09 Generate keyword ideas relevant to your niche\n7:30 Analyze search intent for your keywords\n8:18 Optimize your videos to be found in Google search\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\n\n#youtubekeywordresearch #youtubekeywordtool #youtubeseo #videoseo","publishedAt":"2019-02-27T12:45:01Z","tags":["youtube keyword research","youtube keyword tool","youtube keyword research tool","how to do keyword research for youtube","keyword research for youtube","youtube keyword research 2018","youtube keyword tools","keyword research","youtube seo","video seo","video marketing","seo"],"title":"YouTube Keyword Research: How to Get More Views Consistently","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kAuM2nQb_P8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kAuM2nQb_P8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kAuM2nQb_P8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kAuM2nQb_P8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kAuM2nQb_P8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M47S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"295","dislikeCount":"80","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1590","viewCount":"79981"}},{"id":"_oU8lclN114","snippet":{"description":"Learn how to use Ahrefs for SEO and to get more traffic to your website.\nTry Ahrefs SEO tools \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\n\nAhrefs provides premium SEO tools for keyword research, competitive analysis, website traffic, backlink checking, and more. \n\nWhile these are some of the more \u201cpopular\u201d things that our toolset is known for, there is a lot more to Ahrefs than this.\n\nIn this basic tutorial, you\u2019ll learn 11 powerful ways to use Ahrefs effectively.\n\n1.

See real-life examples with supporting stats and drive more traffic to your website or blog.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nOver the past 10 years, I\u2019ve run countless online marketing experiments, which have accumulated into a nice list of case studies. Today, I share some of the best ways to get more traffic fast based on my own websites and blogs as well as in-house strategies we practice at Ahrefs. \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s covered in the tutorial.\n\n1. The Reverse Quora Technique\nQuora is a popular question and answer forum. But posting on questions with a lot of views or upvotes is not a good method to get free traffic from this platform.\n\nInstead, you can reverse engineer Quora\u2019s organic keyword rankings in Google for a data-driven way to find topics that will get passive SEO traffic.\n\nThe result? Over 40,000 visitors and 15,000 leads from Quora alone to a brand new website.\n\n2. The 17K Experiment\nFacebook ads and Google ads are popular paid sources to get traffic to your website. But as they grow in popularity, they get more expensive. \n\nBut there are a lot of cheap advertising platforms out there simply because they\u2019re not used as much. Meaning, less competition.\n\nI tested ad platforms such as Pinterest, Taboola, Reddit, Outbrain, and Yahoo Gemini. Two of these platforms worked really well for me and one even produced a 3.5X ROI on every dollar spent.\n\n3. Get a boost in organic traffic without creating new pages\nThis is one of the best ways to get free traffic to your website and all you need to do is update out-of-date content. \n\nBut there\u2019s more to this strategy than picking a random blog post and rewriting it. This video outlines criteria to watch for to maximize your chances of getting more visitors to your blog.\n\nWe\u2019ve been using this technique at Ahrefs and have seen near instant spikes in traffic to some of our pages. \n\n4. The Content Multiplier\nYou might have heard of repurposing content. But does it actually work? \n\nThe video covers some slick hacks we use on Twitter to drive higher engagement for each tweet. We also share some of our blog and YouTube stats that shows the exponential growth we\u2019ve had over the past 7 months.\n\n5. Improve Click-through Rate on All Platforms\nThis one might seem obvious to you.

In fact, creating a sustainable backlinks strategy In 2019, will likely get harder.\n\nGoogle SEO is a competitive landscape and the people who are winning are those that are willing to put in the work. \n\nThe good news is that not everyone is willing to put in the hard work and effort to keep their articles up to date. \n\nOver the years, \u201colder\u201d pages may have built backlinks naturally. And back then, their pages probably deserved them. \n\nBut do they still deserve them today? In many situations, the answer is no.\n\nAs SEOs and marketers are getting smarter, creating high-quality content has become necessity.\n\nBut you may have had a hard time getting exposure whether that be due to a small marketing budget or the top ranking pages having way too many links to compete.\n\nHowever, there are easy ways to identify \u201clow quality pages\u201d and to use these as opportunities to create backlinks to your superior, up-to-date content. \n\nThe easiest way to find these link opportunities is to use a tool like Ahrefs\u2019 Content Explorer.

Finally, add a date filter to search for pages that were published a while ago.\n\nThis should give you a nice list of potential pages that have earned backlinks, but may not have updated their content to meet current standards.\n\nFrom here, you can analyze these pages backlink profiles and pitch relevant link prospects with your better resource. \n\nThere are a few more techniques covered in the video that will help you scale this link building strategy to find a ton of prospects.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:54 Find pages that have a lot of quality links\n2:08 Check the pages with decent traffic but thin content\n3:50 Start creating your content that\u2019s better\n4:30 Find relevant link prospect for your \u201cbetter\u201d content\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\n\n#backlinks #linkbuilding #seo #seotips","publishedAt":"2019-02-06T12:30:03Z","tags":["how to get backlinks","how to steal competitors backlinks","backlinks","seo backlinks","how to build backlinks","how to create backlinks","backlinks seo","backlinks seo strategy","get backlinks","get backlinks to my site","get backlinks for my website","get backlinks 2018","steal backlinks","link building","link building strategy","link building strategies"],"title":"How to Get Backlinks By \u201cStealing\u201d From Low-Quality Pages","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wPjPjNK-bDM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wPjPjNK-bDM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wPjPjNK-bDM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wPjPjNK-bDM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wPjPjNK-bDM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"72","dislikeCount":"21","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"707","viewCount":"28168"}},{"id":"OMJQPqG2Uas","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to do keyword research that drives more organic traffic AND conversions. \nTry Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keywords-explorer\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Keyword Research Resources\n\nHow to Choose Long Tail Keywords For Explosive Search Traffic \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a6sqyOh0Njc&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5JCtiYWfvnSvAkoPwg5VY&index=1\n\nHow to Rank on Google for THOUSANDS of Keywords (With One Page) - Data Study \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tnXEtam6ySw&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5JCtiYWfvnSvAkoPwg5VY&index=2\n\nComplete Series on Doing Effective Keyword Research \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3zLBu_NfOaQ&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tIF-QrFD854Mnb8D4Av5vx\n\n***************************************\nIn this keyword research tutorial, Sam Oh goes through a step-by-step process to research keywords and map them to the buyer's journey. \n\nYou'll learn both basic and advanced keyword research tips to attract customers in every stage of their buying journey. Best of all, it's broken down as a step-by-step process. \n\nFirst, you'll learn the four types of keyword categories, what they are, and how they fit into the sales conversion cycle. \n\nThen we'll get straight into generating keyword ideas. \n\nThe keyword research tool used in the tutorial is Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer.

You just need to entertain and engage your audience better than your competitors.\n\nFollow everything from the basics and move to the advanced tips, which should help you rank your videos higher and faster.\n\nFirst, what is YouTube SEO?\n\nIt\u2019s the process of optimizing your videos, playlists, and channel to rank high in YouTube\u2019s organic search results for a given search query.\n\nOur data-driven strategy begins with YouTube Keyword Research.\n\nA couple of free tools you can use are YouTube suggest, paired with Google trends. \n\nThis is a great way to gauge a keywords popularity against other keywords. However, since Google trends shows relative popularity, it may not be the best way to find true search volumes.\n\nAnother tool you can use is Ahrefs\u2019 Keywords Explorer, which shows you search volume and clicks data for any keyword on YouTube.\n\nThis tool works perfectly when paired with Tubebuddy (most tagged videos section) or vidIQ (related keywords feature). \n\nWhile YouTube is the second largest search engine, you can also use other tools like Google search and Ahrefs\u2019 Content Explorer to rank your YouTube videos on the first page of Google search.\n\nIn fact, Google is our second largest source of external referral traffic.\n\nThis video covers all of the tactics, tips, and strategies to rank videos on Google.\n\nThe second step is to identify search intent.\n\nSearch intent represents the reason behind a searcher\u2019s query. To analyze search intent, just type your keyword into the YouTube search bar and see which videos are ranking in the top 3 positions. \n\nTake note of the format and angles other creators are taking and follow suit with your own video. \n\nStep 3 is the most important. And that\u2019s to create a high-retention video. \n\nEngagement is arguably the most important ranking factor in YouTube\u2019s algorithm. If you can\u2019t engage your audience, then you probably won\u2019t rank.\n\nThis can be measured in YouTube Studio analytics by looking at the audience retention graph. You\u2019ll learn EXACTLY how we consistently create high-retention videos from our planning to editing processes.\n\nStep 4 is to do on-page video optimizations.\n\nThis boils down to the title, description, thumbnail, and meta data like YouTube tags. You\u2019ll learn how to optimize your videos following YouTube\u2019s best practices.\n\nStep 5 are in-video optimizations.\n\nYouTube allows you to add subtitles or closed captions (CC) to your videos. This helps bring context to your videos which can be helpful when trying to rank your videos. \n\nYou\u2019ll also learn a couple engagement hacks using YouTube cards and end-screens. \n\nStep 6 is to publish and promote your video\n\nWhether you have a massive audience or tiny one, you\u2019ll learn how to promote your videos to get more views fast.\n\nStep 7 is to optimize your videos (and channel) for session watch time. \n\nSession watch time is the total time a viewer watches videos on YouTube without leaving the platform.\n\nYouTube said on their creator blog that they use this metric as a ranking factor in their search and discovery algorithm.\n\nOur channel playlist hack will help you do just that.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:04 What is YouTube SEO\n1:52 YouTube keyword research\n5:52 Identify user\u2019s search intent\n6:34 Create high-retention videos\n9:26 On-page optimization for videos\n13:01 In-video optimizations\n14:24 Publish and promote your video\n15:39 Optimize your video for session watch time\n17:24 Sam\u2019s channel page hack\n\n#youtubeseo #videoseo #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-03-14T15:00:03Z","tags":["youtube seo","youtube seo 2019","video seo","video marketing","rank videos","how to rank videos","how to rank youtube videos","how to rank on youtube","seo","video optimization","youtube rankings","audience retention","youtube keyword research","youtube tags","how to edit videos for youtube","meta data","tutorial","tips","how to","search engine optimization"],"title":"YouTube SEO: How to Rank Your Videos #1","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NY3y0V9UDwM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NY3y0V9UDwM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NY3y0V9UDwM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NY3y0V9UDwM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NY3y0V9UDwM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"774","dislikeCount":"214","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5058","viewCount":"201907"}},{"id":"j5EOWffq-gk","snippet":{"description":"Learn how to edit videos for YouTube that drives high engagement and high audience retention rates.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nVideo Marketing Resources\n\nYouTube SEO: How to Rank Your Videos #1 (Start to Finish) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NY3y0V9UDwM\n\nYouTube Keyword Research: How to Get More Views Consistently \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kAuM2nQb_P8\n\nAdobe After Effects Tutorial \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cw7_0l2ohhQ\n\n***************************************\n\nPeople often ask how I edit my YouTube videos and which editing software we use to make them look \u201cpolished.\u201d The truth is that a fancy video doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all about driving engagement. \n\nToday, Sam Oh shows you the exact process to edit videos and drive high engagement with just a few tools.\n\nThe editing programs we use to make YouTube videos are: \n\nAdobe Premiere Pro CC (production)\nAdobe After Effects CC (Animation)\nAdobe Audition (Audio)\nQuicktime Player (Screencast recordings)\nDropbox (Collaboration)\n\nAll of these tools are available on PC and mac.\n\nBut you don\u2019t need to use these exact tools. We just find that these softwares work best together. A couple substitutes could be to use Final Cut Pro X instead of Premiere Pro or to use Filmora instead of Quicktime Player.\n\nAs for our editing process, this tutorial covers everything from syncing audio to cutting all unnecessary footage, to production and finalizing it with video effects.\n\nHere\u2019s what our 10 step process looks like.\n\nFirst, we add all audio and visual assets to the Premiere Project.\n\nThis is the place where you\u2019ll be producing and eventually rendering your video to its final version.\n\nThe second step is to clean and enhance the quality of your video\u2019s audio.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn basic tips on how to clean up background noise and add effects to your voice to make it sound full. \n\nNext up, we cut out all mistakes from our video. \nOur raw video recordings are generally 2-3 times longer than the final video. You\u2019ll learn how we quickly cut out all mistakes using the audio wave hack. \n\nThe fourth step is to record additional footage like a screencast or b-roll. \nBeing in the how-to industry, our videos often need screencast demonstrations to better illustrate what we are doing. If you\u2019re a vlogger, then using b-roll will help connect with your audience and create dynamics within your video. \n\nStep 5 is to sync your screencast and b-roll footage with your talking head \n\nA video with all screencast or all talking head is usually boring. This step is all about syncing audio with the video and choosing the best footage to engage your audience and create a silky smooth viewing experience. \n\nThe next step is important if you want to create engaging YouTube videos. And that\u2019s to \u201cclose the gaps.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to polish your assembled video by using the gap system. The gap system is focused completely on creating the best user experience for the viewers. And by making a great viewing experience, you\u2019ll be able to increase audience retention rates. \n\nStep 7 is to add jump cuts.\nA jump cut is a transition between two shots from the same position. It creates the effect of the scene \u201cjumping,\u201d hence, the name, \u201cjump cut.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll learn when to use jump cuts, where to use them, and how to add them to your videos in seconds, even if you\u2019re a complete beginner. \n\nStep 8 is to create video production notes for your editor.\nWhether you\u2019re editing your videos alone or with a team, creating production notes allows you to make a good video for your audience.\n\nThe next step is to add all effects and animations.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you add these towards the end of your editing process because you\u2019ll have a full view of what your video will look and sound like. This will prevent wasted time from adding and removing animations in the previous steps.\n\nThe last and final step is to review your video and create a feedback loop with your team. \n\nUnlike a blog or website, you can\u2019t add or remove edits to videos after they\u2019ve been published. This is the step where we create a feedback loop between design and marketing to ensure that everything is optimal for our YouTube subscribers.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:11 Add audio and visual assets to Premiere Project\n1:40 Clean and enhance your audio\n3:17 Cut out all the mistakes from your video\n4:25 Record a screencast (a b-roll for vloggers)\n5:32 Sync your footage with your talking head\n5:58 Close all the \u201cgaps\u201d in your footage\n7:11 Add some jump cuts\n8:02 Add \u201cproduction\u201d notes for your video expert\n8:57 Add your effects and animations\n9:23 Review the video and add finishing touches\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-03-06T16:45:00Z","tags":["how to edit videos for youtube","how to edit youtube videos","how to edit videos","video editing tutorial","editing videos for youtube","how i edit my youtube videos","how to edit your youtube videos","how to edit videos for beginners","how to edit a youtube video","how to make a youtube video","how to make youtube videos","best editing software for youtube videos","how to edit videos on youtube","youtube marketing"],"title":"How to Edit YouTube Videos for High Engagement","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j5EOWffq-gk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j5EOWffq-gk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j5EOWffq-gk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j5EOWffq-gk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j5EOWffq-gk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M49S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"126","dislikeCount":"12","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"820","viewCount":"23591"}},{"id":"Y0efU3BI4UI","snippet":{"description":"We (Ahrefs) released a new version of Content Explorer in our suite of SEO tools.

Getting links from topically relevant and authoritative websites\n2. Creating contextual relevance through internal linking \n\nA very important SEO tactic is to ensure that the content you put out actually matches the searcher\u2019s intent. Sam teaches you exactly how by examining the 3 C\u2019s of search intent:\n\nNext, ensure your content is kept fresh by first identifying which ones to update and then going ahead to update that content. Here, Sam outlines the 5 questions to ask yourself that will help you decide which pages to update.\n\nThe next SEO tip would be to focus on links that move the needle. Not all links are created equal. Learn the 3 criteria that will help you identify 'authoritative' backlink opportunities.\n\nThe final thing that's working for us is YouTube SEO and ranking those videos in Google search. We have been doing this at Ahrefs consistently over a year, which has helped generate thousands of new customers. \n\nArmed with this arsenal of SEO marketing techniques and through relentless execution, you\u2019d be well on your way towards creating SEO growth for your website. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:51 Make sure your site is mobile-optimized\n1:13 Start with topical research\n2:51 Build topical authority\n5:00 Match the users\u2019 search intent\n6:22 Keep your content fresh\n8:23 Look for 'authoritative' backlinks\n10:45 Focus on YouTube SEO\n\n#seo #seotips #seotutorial\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-05-29T14:30:02Z","tags":["seo","seo 2019","seo tips","seo for beginners","seo tutorial","learn seo","learn seo 2019","seo tutorial for beginners","seo trends","search engine optimization","google seo","beginner seo","seo strategy","seo tactics","seo techniques","how seo works","how to do seo","rank on google","organic traffic","what is seo","how to seo","seo marketing","seo training","seo training 2019","ahrefs","ahref"],"title":"SEO in 2019 - What\u2019s Working Today?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tBjn5TlCZ4c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tBjn5TlCZ4c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tBjn5TlCZ4c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tBjn5TlCZ4c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tBjn5TlCZ4c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"207","dislikeCount":"33","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1923","viewCount":"55682"}},{"id":"wZZnxXyES80","snippet":{"description":"New to the world of digital marketing?

I'm sure you've experienced writer's block or even worse, no blog traffic. And without traffic, you can\u2019t make money blogging or grow your online business.\n\nEven for us, it took a lot of time, effort, and a simple blogging strategy that helped us drive over 220,000 visitors to our blog every single month (for free).\n\nYou\u2019ll learn exactly how to use our blogging strategy along with helpful tips to start getting readers and fans to your blog.\n\nThe first step is to come up with topics that are proven to generate traffic. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that you should write about something you are passionate about or interested in. But this can often lead to failure. \n\nIf you want your blog to be successful, you have to frame your content so that it\u2019s centered around your readers. The truth is that people are interested in themselves and not necessarily yours. \n\nWhile you can make educated guesses, you can use tools like Ahrefs' Keywords Explorer to find the exact keywords people are searching for in Google. This will allow you to accurately gauge popularity and make smart decisions on what you should write about. \n\nThe second step is to assess search intent. \n\nThis means the reason behind a searcher's query. If you don't understand why someone is searching for a specific query, then you won't be able to get them to click on your article. \n\nYou can use a basic formula called \"the 3 C's of search intent\", which is covered in-depth. \n\nThe next step is to write a data-driven outline.\n\nWriting out your thoughts is great, but it can also result in missing out on opportunities to get more blog traffic. \n\nYou'll learn how to analyze other top pages that are getting lots of traffic and integrate what\u2019s working for them into your own posts before you even start writing your draft.\n\nThe next step is to write your first draft. \n\nYou'll learn some blogging tips you can use to write excellent posts that will keep your readers engaged. You'll also learn a few techniques such as the Pomodoro technique which will help you write blog posts fast.\n\nThe next step is to edit your draft. \n\nHere, you'll be shown some free tools that will help you edit like a pro. These tools can improve accuracy, speed, and make the whole experience painless.\n\nBest of all, one of the tools will help you keep the readability of your article perfect for your audience. \n\nIn addition to these, you'll learn a few extra tips at Ahrefs. One of these tips has helped us build a loyal following and enables us to consistently produce our best content. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:57 Learn what kind of traffic do you need\n2:19 Come up with topics that will get you traffic\n5:29 Assess search intent\n7:27 Create a data-driven outline\n9:01 Write the first draft\n10:04 Edit your draft\n10:53 Get honest feedback for your draft\n11:50 Come up with the final draft\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\n\n#blogging #bloggingtips #blog","publishedAt":"2019-05-08T14:30:00Z","tags":["how to write a blog post","how to blog","how to start blogging","blogging for beginners","blogging basics","blogging tips","how to write a blog for beginners","blog writing","start blogging","how to start a blog","how to write a blog","blog post","how to write a blog post fast","blog traffic","how to get traffic to your blog","seo for bloggers","blogging","blog","blog post writing","writing a blog post","article writing","content marketing","ahref"],"title":"How to Write a Blog Post That Actually Gets Traffic","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-kOT39l0omU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-kOT39l0omU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-kOT39l0omU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-kOT39l0omU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-kOT39l0omU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M23S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"230","dislikeCount":"44","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3024","viewCount":"87373"}},{"id":"PZHF_Yyohhw","snippet":{"description":"Everybody wants to rank number one on Google.

Use keyword modifiers that do not change search intent\n2. Content gap analysis at the page level\n3. Match search intent for your target keyword better than your competitors. \n4.

Those that get at least some level of search traffic\n2. Those that get more than 100 search visits per month\n\nSam then shares the exact breakdown of organic traffic that the Wix and Wordpress sites get.\n\nBut since there are numerous factors that influence organic traffic like backlinks, we went on to analyze the average Domain Rating, number of dofollow referring domains and monthly search traffic for each platform. \n\nWe then applied both the mean and the median (instead of just looking at the averages) for each of these statistics to see if we can identify any correlationship. \n\nFinally, we fine tuned the analysis by:\n1. Levelling the sample sizes across the board.\n2. Studying the number of keywords the websites ranked for in Google\u2019s top 10 search and summing the traffic that they accounted for.\n3. Removing keywords that were exact matches to the domain. \n\nIn this video, Sam Oh shares the results from our data, some interesting observations and a few reasons why some SEOs aren\u2019t fans of Wix when it comes to search engine optimization. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:06 The Background of our data study\n2:32 Factors that influence organic traffic\n4:43 Factors that impact monthly search visits\n6:55 Key takeaways from our study\n8:09 Technical SEO limitations of Wix\n\n#wix #wixseo #wordpressseo #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-06-12T14:30:00Z","tags":["wix seo","wix vs wordpress","wordpress vs wix","seo wix","seo with wix","seo for wix website","wix seo review","wix seo optimization","wix seo problems","wordpress seo","seo","search engine optimization","wix","wix.com","wix website","wix seo basics","wordpress","wix review"],"title":"Wix SEO vs. WordPress: An Ahrefs Study of 6.4M Domains","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/VR9CUVXy_Eo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/VR9CUVXy_Eo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/VR9CUVXy_Eo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/VR9CUVXy_Eo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/VR9CUVXy_Eo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"187","dislikeCount":"11","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"574","viewCount":"20632"}},{"id":"dON_kBewzAg","snippet":{"description":"Do reciprocal links hurt your organic rankings?

However, most people are not making full use of it.\n\nThis tutorial will teach you how to use Google Search Console to improve your SEO. \n\nBefore watching the video, make sure you\u2019ve already handled the basics like verifying your site and submitting your sitemap to Google. \n\nThe first tip is to improve click-through rate for underperforming keywords. For the purposes of this video, an underperforming keyword is any page where you don\u2019t rank in positions 1 and 2 for that keyword. \n\nBasically, if you\u2019re not ranking in positions 1 or 2, you\u2019ll get significantly less search traffic. \n\nSam will show you how to find these underperforming keywords and how to optimize them for better rankings.\n \nThe second tip is to find and analyze pages with high keyword rankings, but low CTR. You\u2019ll learn how to find out which keywords have subpar CTR, how to analyze the cause and how to improve those pages so you can get more clicks and traffic. \n\nThe third tip is to check for sitemap errors, warnings, and exclusions. Sitemaps are files that tell search engines which pages are important on your site. They also help crawlers crawl your site more efficiently.\n\nIf you have issues with your sitemap, you might have a problem since you could be confusing crawlers, leading to wasted time and resources on their end. \n\nSam will teach you how to find out if you have any errors on your sitemap and how to fix them. \n\nThe last tip is to find pages that need internal links or those that need to be pruned. You\u2019ll learn how to find these pages, and what to do about them.\n\nTime stamps\n\n0:50 - Improve clickthrough rate for underperforming keywords \n3:07 - Find and analyze the pages with high keyword rankings but low CTR\n5:28 - Check for sitemap errors, warnings, and exclusions\n6:42 - Find pages that need internal links or those that need to be pruned\n9:02 - Limitations of Google Search Console\n\n#googlesearchconsole #seo #seotutorial\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-10-16T14:30:01Z","tags":["google search console","how to use google search console","google search console tutorial","search console","using google search console","google search console setup","how to use search console for seo","new search console","google webmaster tools","google webmaster","webmaster tools","how to use google webmaster tools for seo","google webmasters tutorial","seo tips","improve seo","seo","search engine optimization"],"title":"How to use Google Search Console to Improve Your SEO","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FXVEb_eklhk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FXVEb_eklhk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FXVEb_eklhk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FXVEb_eklhk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FXVEb_eklhk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M50S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"252","dislikeCount":"30","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2323","viewCount":"85146"}},{"id":"3sF-m5LKCf4","snippet":{"description":"Having a heard time getting links?

Negotiation or persuasion isn\u2019t about tricking people. These are tools to communicate more effectively so you don\u2019t come off too strong in your first email.\n\nNow, a short definition. Negotiation and persuasion are two completely different things. \n\nAccording to Professor Bontempo from Columbia Business School, negotiation is a mutual exchange of resources for a mutual benefit. Meaning, you\u2019re coming to some form of an agreement. \n\nPersuasion on the other hand is more about changing someone\u2019s mind. It\u2019s subtle, follows a gradual process consisting of small movements. And the idea is to make your end goal their idea. It generally takes a lot more time, but it\u2019s free. \n\nNow, when you\u2019re building links, some links will come fast, others within a medium timeframe, and others can take months.\n\nAnd in this video, you will learn how these two techniques fit in those categories and how to know when to switch from one to the other to improve your chances of getting a backlink. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:16 How to differ negotiation and persuasion\n2:07 Get some fast links with negotiation\n4:46 Build medium-speed links with a mix of negotiation and persuasion \n6:35 Get slow links by persuading publishers to link to you\n9:26 Mistakes you do not want to repeat when looking for a backlink\n\n#backlinks #linkbuilding #howtogetbacklinks\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-11-27T15:30:02Z","tags":["how to get backlinks","how to get quality backlinks","get backlinks","how to build backlinks","how to create backlinks","how to create backlinks for my website","create backlinks","how to make backlinks","seo link building","link building seo","link building","link building strategy","high quality backlinks","backlinks for beginners","seo backlinks","backlink","ahrefs"],"title":"How to Get Backlinks with Negotiation and Persuasion","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mxusD0K-IYA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mxusD0K-IYA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mxusD0K-IYA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mxusD0K-IYA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mxusD0K-IYA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"122","dislikeCount":"11","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"406","viewCount":"13405"}},{"id":"O5L9mBceJ7s","snippet":{"description":"What are backlinks and why are they important for SEO?

If you\u2019re linking to others, it\u2019s called an external, outgoing or outbound link. \n\nWhy are backlinks important? There are three main reasons, and you\u2019ll learn what those reasons are in the video. \n\nThe easiest way to conceptualize backlinks is to think of them as votes. When a page receives a backlink, it\u2019s essentially another website vouching for the content on the page. And the more \u201cvotes,\u201d you get from credible sources, the higher the trust.\n\nBut not all backlinks are created equal. \n\nHow do you tell a \u201cgood quality backlink\u201d from a \u201cnot-so-good\u201d one? You\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\nAnd now that you\u2019ve learned how to tell the difference between high and low-quality backlinks, you\u2019ll want to check backlinks pointing at your own site.\n\nWe\u2019ll show you the two places you can do this for free. \n\nAnd finally, how do you get backlinks? \n\nOn the whole, there are three main methods to getting backlinks.

This is the most common approach.

You need to understand and learn what these fundamentals are before you can generate meaningful traffic to your site via search engines like Google. \n\nThe two key fundamentals you need to master are keyword research and on-page SEO. \n\nAfter you\u2019ve nailed the fundamentals, Sam recommends that you get an internship at a respected SEO agency. You\u2019ll find out why this is the best way to learn, and how you can get an internship at a company you respect in the industry. \n\nSam also recommends you apply the 80\/20 rules to SEO. The 80\/20 rule, also known as Pareto\u2019s principle suggests that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. You\u2019ll learn how to apply this rule to your SEO education. \n\nThe next thing you should focus on is to refine processes rather than search for shortcuts. You\u2019ll learn how to do this, as opposed to constantly seeking out shortcuts, hacks or the next shiny tactic. \n\nLastly, soft skills. SEO isn\u2019t always about the hard, technical skills.

Probably not, because you\u2019ll be limiting your pool of prospects too much. \n\nInstead, use these as guidelines to determine the amount of time and effort you\u2019re willing to put into gaining links from certain pages and sites. And also use them to find which sites you\u2019ll want to avoid building links on.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:48 - Is the site\u2019s content relevant to my niche?\n2:59 - Is the page relevant to my niche and\/or the topic of my content?\n4:25 - Does the linking site have authority?\n5:44 - Is the website getting consistent traffic from Google?\n7:05 - Does the linking page get search traffic?\n7:32 - Are most external links on site nofollowed?\n8:43 - Does a site link out to too many pages?\n\n#backlinks #qualitylinks #linkbuilding\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-12-18T15:30:00Z","tags":["backlinks","high quality links","high quality backlinks","quality links","quality backlinks","backlink","back links","link building","backlinks for beginners","off page seo","how to build backlinks","link building seo","how to get backlinks","backlinks seo","what are backlinks","what is a backlink","what is backlinking","ahref"],"title":"7 Attributes of High Quality Backlinks","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E3mDlVutW_o\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E3mDlVutW_o\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E3mDlVutW_o\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E3mDlVutW_o\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E3mDlVutW_o\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M2S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"100","dislikeCount":"11","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"720","viewCount":"28152"}},{"id":"73lj6m6Xulc","snippet":{"description":"Want to improve SEO for your site?

When you implement lazy loading, things like images or videos will only load when they\u2019re visible on the page. \n\nThis will reduce initial page load time, initial page weight, and system resource usage, all of which should positively impact performance.\n\nFind out what tools you\u2019ll need to enable lazy loading in the video. \n\nNext, improve clickthrough rate for pages ranking on page one.\n\nIt\u2019s widely accepted in the SEO community that pages with a higher clickthrough rate can help increase rankings. \n\nAnd since 75% of users never scroll past the first page of search results, it\u2019s better to focus on improving CTR for your first page rankings.\n\nLearn how to do this in the video. \n\nThird, send emails to everyone you link to. This 10-minute outreach strategy is a great way to passively earn links and grow your network. You will learn how to do this in the video. \n\nFourth, add internal links to your new pages. \n\nInternal linking helps to improve crawlability, gets your pages indexed faster, improves topical relevance, and distributes PageRank to other pages so you can rank higher in Google. \n\nTo learn how to find relevant pages to add internal links from, watch the video. \n\nThe next tip is to become a power skimmer of HARO using Gmail filters. \n\nHARO stands for help a reporter out. It\u2019s a free service where journalists can ask questions, and anyone can respond and be a source for mega publications like The New York Times and Forbes.\n\nThe thing with this service is that they usually send 3 emails per day which can be quite overwhelming, considering 90% of the queries probably won\u2019t be relevant to you. \n\nSo, a quick hack to make sure opportunities don\u2019t get missed is to lighten the load with Gmail filters. \n\nHow do you do this? Watch the video. \n\nSixth, perform an annual content audit. A content audit is where you analyze the performance of all content on your site to determine whether it should be kept as-is, updated, deleted, consolidated, or redirected.\n\nYou\u2019ll find out how to perform a content audit in the video. \n\nLastly, repurpose your best-performing blog posts to videos, and your best videos to blog posts. You\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video.  \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:39 - Boost page speed with lazy load\n1:25 - Improve clickthrough for pages ranking on page one\n4:02 - Send e-mails to everyone you link to\r\n5:47 - Add internal links to your new pages\r\n7:09 - Become a power skimmer of HARO using Gmail filters\r\n8:30 - Perform an annual content audit\r\n9:28 - Repurpose best-performing blog posts to videos, and vice versa\r\n\n#seotips #improveseo #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-12-11T15:30:00Z","tags":["seo tips","improve seo","seo improvements","seo tips and tricks","seo tricks","seo techniques","seo strategies","seo strategies and techniques","seo tactics","seo","search engine optimization","seo 2020","seo for beginners","ahref","seo tutorial"],"title":"SEO Tips to Improve Organic Traffic in Under 15 Minutes","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/73lj6m6Xulc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/73lj6m6Xulc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/73lj6m6Xulc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/73lj6m6Xulc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/73lj6m6Xulc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"200","dislikeCount":"28","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1361","viewCount":"48350"}},{"id":"V2Kdl9Kuhio","snippet":{"description":"What\u2019s the difference between SEO and SEM?

In fact, around 5 billion searches happen on Google every single day.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also been reported that search engines drive 10 times more traffic to shopping sites than social media. And 72% of consumers who did a local search visited a store within 5 miles. \r\n\r\nWith that said, SEO and PPC are both important. \r\n\r\nThink about it: search engines are businesses. They need to make money in order to operate. As a result, most, if not all platforms will give premium placements to paying customers. \r\n\r\nFor commercial keywords, the entire fold is covered in ads, making organic results near invisible. A searcher would have to scroll down for a while before even entertaining the thought of going to your page. \r\n\r\nHowever, Google doesn\u2019t show ads on every page for every search. There needs to be some sort of commercial intent in order for ads to appear. \r\n\r\nSo, even if you had an infinite budget for PPC, you would not be ranking #1 for every keyword. \r\n\r\nThis is why we have another acronym, SEM, where we can combine the two strategies and truly take our search engine marketing to another level.  \r\n\r\nAnd in this video, you\u2019ll learn a few strategies on when and why to implement SEO, PPC or both. \r\n\r\nTimestamps:\r\n\n1:45 SEO or PPC? \u200b\ud83e\udd14\n3:40 Run ads for keywords that are too competitive to rank for\r\n4:15 PPC benefits while working on SEO\r\n6:19 Use SEO + PPC when search results pages are covered in ads\r\n7:19 Own as much real estate as possible\r\n\n#seovssem #seo #sem\r\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2019-12-04T15:30:02Z","tags":["seo vs sem","seo vs sem vs ppc","sem vs seo","seo and sem","seo","sem","seo vs ppc","search engine optimization","search engine marketing","what is sem","ppc","what is seo","pay per click","paid search","google adwords","google ads","adwords","paid traffic","seo tutorial","ahrefs"],"title":"SEO vs. SEM: What\u2019s the Difference and Why Should You Care?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V2Kdl9Kuhio\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V2Kdl9Kuhio\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V2Kdl9Kuhio\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V2Kdl9Kuhio\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V2Kdl9Kuhio\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M7S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"103","dislikeCount":"10","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"517","viewCount":"18971"}},{"id":"9JOSAqmbrtc","snippet":{"description":"Find out how to build the perfect SEO setup on Google Chrome with our list of must-have Chrome extensions. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nThe Best WordPress SEO Plugins (It\u2019s Not Yoast) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cFI_jRVOQZk\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ\n\nSEO Checklist 2019: Get More Organic Traffic (Step-by-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=taU9P98zfjk \n\nKeyword Research Tutorial: From Start to Finish \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OMJQPqG2Uas\n\nOn Page SEO Checklist for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gDYjjkvtOVo&\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\n***************************************\nMost SEOs love Google Chrome Extensions. \n\nBut having too many extensions doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to higher productivity.

When this happens, you might be tempted to look at unsustainable ways to run a quick side hustle.\n\nThis is the wrong way to approach affiliate marketing. Here\u2019s why.\n\nBusiness Insider found that around 15% of the digital media industry's revenue comes from affiliate marketing. But that report was published in 2016, and today, affiliate marketing has become even more popular. \n\nThis means that it\u2019s possible to build a sustainable business with affiliate marketing. In fact, it\u2019s possible to build a multi-million dollar affiliate website that you\u2019re proud of. And that\u2019s exactly what this tutorial will help you do. \n\nSo, what exactly is affiliate marketing and how does it work? \n\nAffiliate marketing is when you promote other people\u2019s or companies\u2019 products. When someone makes a purchase through your affiliate link, you\u2019re compensated with a commission.\n\nTo know you\u2019re the person who sent them the sale, the merchant uses a unique link.\n\nWhen a visitor clicks that link from your website, blog, or wherever, a small file called a cookie is stored on their device. \n\nAn affiliate cookie does two things: \n\n\u25ba It helps the merchant attribute the sale back to the right person; \n\u25ba It (usually) holds an expiration date. This means a person that clicks through via your link doesn\u2019t have to immediately purchase the product. \n\nYou\u2019ll see an example of how this works in the video. \n\nSo how much money can you make as an affiliate marketer? \n\nThe simple answer to that is that there is no limit. There are reports from affiliate marketers who are making over 6-figures a month in affiliate commissions. You\u2019ll see some examples of these reports in the video. \n\nWith those questions answered, let\u2019s go over the things you\u2019ll need to get started with affiliate marketing. \n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need a platform where you can use affiliate links. You\u2019ll find out which platforms you can choose from in the video. \n\nNext, you\u2019ll need to choose a niche. When you\u2019re choosing a niche, remember you\u2019re choosing a niche, not an industry. You\u2019ll learn some tips on how to find a profitable niche in the tutorial. \n\nThirdly, finding affiliate programs to join. There are lots of popular affiliate networks like Amazon Associates, Commission Junction and ClickBank. However, these aren\u2019t the only affiliate networks out there.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn proven ways to find high converting affiliate programs and those with high sales volume. \n\nYou\u2019ll also learn the three models of affiliate programs that are available as well as each of their pros and cons. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten the fundamentals of affiliate marketing down, here\u2019s a basic formula to actually make money from your affiliate marketing site. \n\nTraffic + clicks + conversions = revenue \n\nIn the video, you\u2019ll learn how to optimize the different aspects of the formula to help you get more affiliate revenue to your site. \n\nFinally, the last piece of advice is to experiment. \n\nDon\u2019t expect perfection or a life-changing income that happens overnight. It doesn\u2019t happen that way, otherwise, we\u2019d all be billionaires.\n\nFocus on making that FIRST affiliate sale. And as your site grows, set new reachable goals rather than settling for a one-off hustle. \n\n#affiliatemarketing #affiliatemarketingforbeginners #affiliatemarketingtutorial\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-01-15T15:30:01Z","tags":["affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing for beginners","affiliate marketing tutorial for beginners","how to start affiliate marketing","how to do affiliate marketing","how to become an affiliate marketer","how to get started with affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing 2020","make money with affiliate marketing","start affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing for beginners guide","affiliate marketing 101","amazon affiliate marketing tutorial","amazon affiliate marketing","ahrefs"],"title":"Affiliate Marketing for Beginners: Complete Tutorial for 2020","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W-nbsnXtSZI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W-nbsnXtSZI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W-nbsnXtSZI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W-nbsnXtSZI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W-nbsnXtSZI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M22S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"435","dislikeCount":"23","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1527","viewCount":"63045"}},{"id":"Ml4mQJjgX6g","snippet":{"description":"Want to create a successful blog?

In fact, SEO statistics show that video carousels nearly doubled in the SERPs in 2017.\n\nThis is why you should be focusing on video SEO. \n\nWhat is video SEO? \n\nVideo SEO is different from YouTube SEO. Video SEO is the process of increasing visibility and rankings in search engines like Google. Whereas YouTube SEO is the process of increasing visibility and rankings in YouTube search. The good news: properly optimized videos \n\nThe good news is that properly optimized videos for Google can also rank in YouTube and vice versa, with just a few additional things.\n\nSo, how do you rank your YouTube videos on Google? \n\nThe first step is to find video topics with ranking and traffic potential.  \n\nGoogle ranks content that best serves a user\u2019s query. And generally speaking, if videos are ranking high or are prominent in the SERPs, it\u2019s a sign that creating a video on this topic has the potential to get views from Google.\n\nAnd in this video, you\u2019ll learn three ways to find video topics with both ranking and traffic potential. \n\nStep 2 is to create an optimized video. \n\nYou probably already know the basics of video optimization. Your videos need to engage your audience, i.e., long watch times, high audience retention, and boast-worthy session watch times. \n\nBut something a lot of creators forget is that the Internet is more or less text-based. So if Google, YouTube or any other search engine can\u2019t interpret the text attached to your video, then you\u2019ll never rank your videos on YouTube or Google. \n\nIf you want to optimize your videos (and not just for engagement), you\u2019ll have to give as much context as possible to search engines. And the way you do that boils down to the words spoken in the video, matching visuals, and metadata. \n\nWhile they\u2019re easy to implement, they do require some planning. And in this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn some strategies on how to do this. \n\nThe third step is to add closed captions to your instructional videos. \n\nRemember: we want to help YouTube and Google understand the contents of our video as much as possible.\n\nAnd since the words that are spoken can easily be transcribed to text, this is probably the best and easiest way to add context to your video. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nStep 4 is to create an enticing thumbnail.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that great thumbnails lead to more clicks. So, you\u2019ll learn a couple of cool tips on how to make a compelling thumbnail that gets viewers to click. \n\nFinally, the last step is to add timestamps to your videos. This can help you get the \u201ckey moments\u201d feature on Google.\n\nKey moments is a new SERP feature was released in September 2019. Here\u2019s Google explanation about this:\n\n\u201cWhen you search for things like how-to videos that have multiple steps, or long videos like speeches or a documentary, Search will provide links to key moments within the video based on timestamps provided by content creators.\u201d\n\nHow do you capture \u201ckey moments\u201d with your video? You\u2019ll learn how in this tutorial. \n\nTo conclude, it\u2019s estimated that video will represent 82% of ALL IP traffic in 2021. The fact that video is starting to dominate Google\u2019s SERP is a good indicator that it\u2019s time to up your video SEO game. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:18 Find video topics that rank and bring traffic\n5:13 Optimize your video for organic rankings\n9:07 Importance of closed captions\n10:22 Valuable tips on thumbnail improvement\n11:07 Use timestamps to highlight key moments of the video\n\n#videoseo #youtubeseo #videomarketing\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-02-26T14:00:02Z","tags":["video seo","video seo 2020","youtube seo","video marketing","video seo tutorial","rank videos","how to rank videos","youtube video seo","what is video seo","video seo strategy","video seo statistics","video seo meaning","youtube marketing","how to rank youtube videos","how to rank youtube videos fast","how to rank youtube videos on google","how to rank on youtube","video optimization","youtube seo tutorial","youtube ranking","ahrefs"],"title":"Video SEO: How to Rank YouTube Videos on the First Page of Google (Fast)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BObU_VCwnvY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BObU_VCwnvY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BObU_VCwnvY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BObU_VCwnvY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BObU_VCwnvY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"97","dislikeCount":"25","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"749","viewCount":"26772"}},{"id":"QCgDIhvFkCM","snippet":{"description":"Video marketing is growing.

They need to find pages and rank the ones that best match and serve the user\u2019s intent.\n\nAnd to figure this out, they use hundreds of ranking factors. \n\nSo, while new changes will be made to Google's core algorithm, the fundamentals of SEO haven't changed.\n\nInstead of chasing algorithms, our job as content creators and marketers is to show search engines that our pages deserve to rank.\n\nRather than searching for the latest EAT hack or trying to optimize for BERT, you should focus on the 3 most important things that will determine the fate of your rankings.\n\nThe first is content. No matter how prolific your writing skills are, you won\u2019t rank unless you\u2019ve gotten your content \u201cright.\u201d\n\nHere are some things to consider: \n\n\u25ba Search intent\n\u25ba Covering the topic in full\n\u25ba On-page SEO\n\nYou\u2019ll learn more about those things in the video. \n\nThe second thing is link building.\n\nLinks have been and still are one of the strongest ranking signals. And if you want to rank for anything remotely competitive, you\u2019ll need to build them. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn what works and doesn\u2019t work in link building in the tutorial. \n\nThe last thing is indexation. \n\nSearch engines crawl, parse, and store information in a database called a search index. End users are then able to access this information using Google search. \n\nSo if your pages aren\u2019t indexed, then it\u2019s impossible to get your site or pages discovered in search.\n \nYou\u2019ll learn how to check whether your sites or pages are indexed in the video and ways to get your website indexed if it's not. \n\nAnd finally, remember that SEO is all about fundamentals. \n\nFocus on the things that matter most rather than chasing shiny tactics from headlines claiming SEO has completely changed.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:38 - Keep search intent in mind\n2:37 - Make sure you cover the topic in full\n3:40 - Set-up on-page stuff properly\n3:58 - Continue building backlinks\n4:58 - Pay attention to indexation\n\n#seo #seoin2020 #seotips\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-02-12T15:30:00Z","tags":["seo","seo 2020","seo in 2020","seo trends 2020","search engine optimization","seo tutorial","search engine optimization tutorial","google seo","seo tips","how to do seo","seo for beginners","seo tutorial for beginners","seo basics","ahrefs"],"title":"SEO in 2020: It Hasn\u2019t Changed (Much)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GywO1qN8J6Y\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GywO1qN8J6Y\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GywO1qN8J6Y\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GywO1qN8J6Y\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GywO1qN8J6Y\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"169","dislikeCount":"14","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1138","viewCount":"28585"}},{"id":"FUYAe5ROeP0","snippet":{"description":"Only 0.78% of Google searchers click page 2 results.

And since you want to rank on the first page of Google, your competition is the top 10 search results. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to analyze them in the video. \n\nThe second step is to make sure your page aligns with search intent. \n\nSearch intent means the reason behind a searcher\u2019s query. In the video, you\u2019ll learn how to determine search intent, as well as how to identify the 3 C\u2019s of search content. \n\nStep 3 is to ensure your content covers the topic in full. You\u2019ll learn some nifty tricks on how to make sure your content is in-depth from the video.\n\nStep 4 is to estimate the number of backlinks you'll need and then build them. Backlinks are an important ranking factor. Not only has Google said it themselves, but pretty much every industry study has found a positive relationship between organic search traffic and backlinks.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to estimate the number of backlinks you\u2019ll need in the video. \n\nStep 5 is to add internal links to your page. \n\nBesides backlinks, internal links can help a lot in ranking as well. In the video, you\u2019ll learn a simple method on how to find pages you should add internal links from. \n\nOnce all of the steps are done, it\u2019s just a matter of waiting. And rather than just simply wait for this page to rank, repeat the process for different keywords and pages.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:29 - \u2018Minimum requirements\u2019 for a chance to rank on the first page\n1:20 - Check the strength of the competition\n2:02 - Estimate the website authority\n3:11 - Determine the search Intent\n4:52 - Ensure your content covers the topic in full\n6:06 - Estimate the backlink strength\n7:14 - Add internal links to your page\n8:25 - Aim for top 3 ranking results\n\n#rankonfirstpageofgoogle #seotips #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-02-05T15:30:00Z","tags":["how to rank on the first page of google","how to get on the first page of google","how to rank website on google first page","how to get on google first page for free","get on the first page of google","rank on google first page","how to rank well on google","how to rank higher in google","improve google rankings","how to rank on google","how to rank in google","how to rank higher on google","rank on google","first page of google","google ranking","seo tips","seo for beginners","ahrefs"],"title":"How to Rank on the First Page of Google","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FUYAe5ROeP0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FUYAe5ROeP0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FUYAe5ROeP0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FUYAe5ROeP0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FUYAe5ROeP0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M18S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"234","dislikeCount":"44","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1806","viewCount":"57302"}},{"id":"QMk2iaJGpSA","snippet":{"description":"Learning how to code can make you a better SEO and marketer.

If you\u2019re just starting out with SEO, focus on the fundamentals first.\n\nAlso, just because you don\u2019t know how to code, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be an excellent SEO.\n\nBut the learning curve to programming is worth the effort because it benefits your efficiency, wallet, and career. \n\nSo, how can you use programming as part of your SEO arsenal? \n\nThe first use case: by learning a server-side language, you can automate redundant tasks. \n\nSEO is filled with redundant tasks, like changing title tags. But this can be done programmatically in a fraction of the time. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nAnother reason you should learn at least the basics of programming is to communicate more effectively with your dev team. \n\nMarketers and developers tend to think differently. Marketers often think of the final result, while developers think of all the steps that are required to get to that result. \n\nWhile it sounds like a match made in heaven, the synergy between the two departments often falters. \n\nThe last reason is that understanding how code works can make you a better technical SEO.\n\nBeing able to read through source code efficiently can help you identify technical SEO issues that most crawling tools wouldn\u2019t discover.\n\nAnd finally, which language should you learn? You\u2019ll get some recommendations in the video.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:08 Use server-side language for automations\n1:52 What is API?\n3:57 Conditional functions for easy automations\n4:08 Use cases with Zapier\n4:51 Communication with the dev team\n6:25 Technical SEO and coding\n\n#codingforseo #programming #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-03-11T13:00:08Z","tags":["coding for seo","coding seo","coding for marketers","coding for digital marketing","seo and coding","coding and seo","seo automation","how to automate seo","technical seo","technical marketing","seo","programming","coding"],"title":"3 Reasons SEOs Should Learn How to Code","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QMk2iaJGpSA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QMk2iaJGpSA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QMk2iaJGpSA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QMk2iaJGpSA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QMk2iaJGpSA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"87","dislikeCount":"8","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"646","viewCount":"16012"}},{"id":"gIg3nCMSvE8","snippet":{"description":"Can you rank on Google without backlinks?

Google says it on their \u201chow search works\u201d page. Our research study confirms a clear positive correlation, and if you ask any experienced SEO, they\u2019ll agree.\n\nBut do you actually need them to get a meaningful amount of search traffic from queries that have some sort of commercial value?\n\nTo find out, let\u2019s look at some data. \n\nTo source our data, we used Ahrefs\u2019 Content Explorer, which is a searchable database of over a billion pages that are filterable by multiple SEO metrics. Then, we:\n\n\u25ba Ran a blank search in Content Explorer \n\u25ba Set the maximum number of referring domains to 0\n\u25ba Set a filter to only show live pages\n\u25ba Set a traffic filter to only show pages that get at least 1,000 monthly search visits \n\u25ba Set the trends filter to show the past 3 years of data  in the sparkline graphs\n\nThe result? 243,000 live pages that get at least 1,000 monthly search visits with 0 backlinks pointing at them.\n\nSince there are too many results, we split them into 3 tiers based on Domain Rating. \n\nDomain Rating is an Ahrefs metric that represents the overall strength of a website\u2019s backlink profile. The closer the number is to 100, the more so-called \u201cauthority\u201d the domain has.\n\nThe three tiers are DR 0 - 30, DR 31-60, and DR 61 plus.\n\nAfter going through these results, what did we discover? How are these pages getting so much traffic, even without any backlinks?\n\nWatch the video to find out. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:41 How to find pages with no backlinks but decent traffic\n2:10 Types of low authority websites with traffic\n4:20 Types of mid-tier pages with some traffic and no backlinks\n6:14 Topic opportunities for high-authority websites\n\n#rankwithoutbacklinks #backlinks #linkbuilding #backlinks #checkbacklinks #getmorebacklinks\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-03-04T14:00:09Z","tags":["rank without backlinks","rank website without backlinks","can I rank without backlinks","how to rank website without backlinks","how to rank without backlinks","seo without links","sei without backlinks","how to rank keyword without backlinks","rank website in google","backlink","link building","seo","search engine optimization","ahrefs"],"title":"Can You Rank Content Without Building Backlinks?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gIg3nCMSvE8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gIg3nCMSvE8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gIg3nCMSvE8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gIg3nCMSvE8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gIg3nCMSvE8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"176","dislikeCount":"20","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"785","viewCount":"27137"}},{"id":"nIbJI1kCxrU","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to create your own content hub to maximize search traffic to your pages. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Content Marketing Resources\n\nContent Marketing and Blogging Tutorials \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5dP7r3VJY_RXCQ84StTXv\n\nWhat is Content Marketing and How to Crush It on a Tiny Budget \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4XrtVkhOBfQ \n\nContent Marketing Strategy That Gets Leads and Sales \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9fglNtHmc8I\n\nBlogging Tips for Beginners That Actually Work \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ml4mQJjgX6g\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ\n\nTypes of Content Hubs: 5 Approaches & 30+ Examples  \u25ba https:\/\/www.contentharmony.com\/blog\/content-hubs\/\n\n***************************************\nContent hubs work because they help build semantic relationships between content. \n\nSo, rather than write a book-length blog post about a particular topic, you can create other relevant guides and internally link between these pages. \n\nThis tells search engines that all the content is related. Plus, having a logical structure to your content provides a better user experience for visitors. \n\nThere are 3 parts to a content hub: \n\u25ba Hub: the pillar content, and usually an in-depth guide or a resource on a broad topic\n\u25ba Subpages: separate pages that go in-depth on a more specific part of your topic\n\u25ba Hyperlinks: used to connect the hub to its subpages and the subpages should also link back to the hub. \n\nSo, how do you create a hub for your site? \n\nThe first step is to brainstorm ideas for your hub pages. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn a few questions you should ask yourself to determine whether it would be a good page in the video. \n\nThe second step is to choose the right subpages. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video, plus you\u2019ll also see an example of how we would build a hypothetical content hub for a yoga site.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:29 How content hubs work\n1:11 Three parts of content hubs\n3:50 Brainstorm ideas for your hub pages\n5:36 Choose subpages that relevant to your topic\n5:59 How to build a content hub for yoga site (example)\n\n#contenthubs #contentmarketing #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-03-18T13:00:23Z","tags":["content hubs","content hub","topic clusters","topic clusters seo","topic clustering","content pillars","subpages","hub and spoke model","hub and spoke","hub and spoke content marketing","hub and spoke content model","hub and spoke method","marketing content hub","pillar and cluster model","pillar article","blog organization","seo content marketing","seo strategy","content strategy","content marketing","seo","blogging for beginners","ahrefs"],"title":"Content Hubs: Where SEO and Content Marketing Meet","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nIbJI1kCxrU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nIbJI1kCxrU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nIbJI1kCxrU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nIbJI1kCxrU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nIbJI1kCxrU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M49S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"108","dislikeCount":"11","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"601","viewCount":"21100"}},{"id":"HyIXvIaUlLk","snippet":{"description":"This tutorial will show you how to use Zapier to automate part of your link building. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Link Building Resources\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step)  \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nCopy My Link Building System: How to Get Backlinks \u201cAt Scale\u201d \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ovu2ZYWgOJQ&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=6\n\nLink Building with Google Sheets: Start Guest Posting in 15 Minutes \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bwYZGWDlQd8 \n\nHow to Find Someone\u2019s Email Address (in Seconds) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HA5tLHG80js \n\nHow to Write Outreach Emails (That Won\u2019t Get Ignored) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nAIWG8883uo&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=2\n\nGuest Posting at Scale: Get Tons of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aQK1Vbgb-RY \n\n***************************************\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of Zapier, it\u2019s a tool that lets you connect web apps together using IF THEN statements. \n\nWhen you create a combination of web apps, they\u2019re called \u201czaps.\u201d\n\nZapier has over 2,000 apps you can mix and match, so there are virtually an infinite number of automations you can create. \n\nBut since this tutorial is about link building automation, that is what we will do. \nTo prepare our link building automation, we need to do some of the manual work first, like getting a list of link prospects, vetting them and finding the first and last name of authors or editors. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nThen, it\u2019s time to start building the zap. \n\nThere are a few steps involved:\n\n1.

So there\u2019s no way you can review them all manually\u2014it would take too long.\n\nSo how do you analyze big backlink profiles of your competitors without going crazy?\n\nFirst, find their superfans. \n\nSuperfans are people who consistently link to someone. \n\nIf someone is so eager to link to the content of your competitor, they might be interested in your content too. \n\nHow do you find these superfans?\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nNext, find the \u201cpower linkers\u201d. \n\nYou can find websites that link to a few blogs that you\u2019re competing with, but they have never linked to your own blog. \nYou\u2019ll learn the step-by-step process of doing this in the video. \n\nFinally, you can analyze their latest backlinks. \n\nChances are, many of the websites who are linking to your competitors probably did so quite a long time ago, but they\u2019re not actively updating their website anymore.\n\nWhile there\u2019s still a chance to persuade them to link to you, the likelihood drops rather significantly.\n\nSo, it\u2019s better to look at the most recently acquired links of your competitors. \n\nYou\u2019ll also learn how to do this in the video. \n\n#competitorbacklinks #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:44Z","tags":["steal backlinks","competitor backlinks","steal competitor backlinks","loot competitor backlinks","competitor backlink analysis","link building strategies","link building strategy","link building tactics","link building","how to build backlinks","how to get backlinks","build backlinks","get backlinks","seo","search engine optimization","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How to \u201cSteal\u201d Your Competitors\u2019 Backlinks [9.2]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zgJtVnJnufA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zgJtVnJnufA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zgJtVnJnufA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zgJtVnJnufA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zgJtVnJnufA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M6S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3","dislikeCount":"4","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"132","viewCount":"11621"}},{"id":"jLGCSC1C2OQ","snippet":{"description":"In this video, Tim Soulo gives an overview of what you will learn in Ahrefs' premium blogging course, Blogging for Business.

Likewise, there\u2019s no way to pull massive traffic from Google and not have a single person share your content on Twitter or Facebook.\n\nBut, for the sake of the video, they will be discussed individually. \n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll learn about the main challenges associated with each strategy and why we favor SEO over viral traffic. \n\n#growyourblog #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:45Z","tags":["how to grow your blog","how to promote your blog","blogger seo","promote your blog posts","promoting blog posts","best way to promote my blog","growing your blog","blog promotion","promote your blog","promote blog","increase blog traffic","how to promote my blog","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How to Grow Your Blog: Two Strategies That Work [2.2]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8IwEdWHlmNI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8IwEdWHlmNI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8IwEdWHlmNI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8IwEdWHlmNI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8IwEdWHlmNI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M10S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"7","dislikeCount":"1","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"115","viewCount":"23462"}},{"id":"Q3deuXtXsrw","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to create truly unique content that stands out.   \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging Resources\n\nBlogging For Business Course (Complete Playlist) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5kQXogrLN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq&index=1\n\nWhy Your Blog Content Has to be Great [6.1] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/4qPaHyOQA9c\n\nHow to Create High-Quality Content That Gets Shared [6.2] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/vya0PdxuP2s\n\nDo You Always Need Backlinks To Rank?

Even the usage of an exact match keyword in your title, headline or even actual content of that page had a weaker correlation.\n\nIn that case, why did a third of SEOs in Tim\u2019s poll vote that you can rank in Google without any backlinks? \n\nYou\u2019ll learn why in this video. \n\n#rankwithoutbacklinks #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:33Z","tags":["rank without backlinks","rank website without backlinks","do you need backlinks to rank","can i rank without backlinks","how to rank without backlinks","how to rank website without backlinks","how to rank keyword without backlinks","backlinks","seo","search engine optimization","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"Do you Always Need Backlinks to Rank?

This is because great content promotes itself.  And usually, great content also tends to attract a lot of backlinks.\n\nBut is great content always linkable content?  It\u2019s not always true. There are a few more requirements that need to be met.\n\nAt its core, linking is a form of sharing.\n\nBut just because a piece of content is \"great\", this doesn't necessarily mean you will share it with others. Plus, in order to link to a piece of content, you have to own some kind of web property, where you can link from. Which the vast majority of people don\u2019t have.\n\nThis is why link acquisition is so tough to crack.\n\nIf you want your article to attract backlinks, you need to make your readers want to share it with others. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do that in the video. \n\n#contentthattattractsbacklinks #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:33Z","tags":["create content that attracts backlinks","linkbait","link bait","content that attracts backlinks","link building","how to build backlinks","get backlinks","building backlinks","building links","how to get backlinks","high quality backlinks","seo link building","backlinks","seo","search engine optimization","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How to Create Content That Attracts Backlinks [7.2]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HsyVKjTWMe8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HsyVKjTWMe8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HsyVKjTWMe8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HsyVKjTWMe8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HsyVKjTWMe8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M27S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2","dislikeCount":"0","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"43","viewCount":"9550"}},{"id":"9LF3NGKJsD8","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to optimize your content to rank for more keywords.  \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging Resources\n\nBlogging For Business Course (Complete Playlist) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5kQXogrLN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq&index=1\n\nWhat is Search Intent and Why Is It Important?

And they\u2019ll be happy and satisfied if they manage to beat the traffic record of a previously published one.\n\nWhile it sounds like a great goal to pursue, it\u2019s not a good one. \n\nBy focusing on short-term traffic you\u2019re focusing on the \u201cspike of hope\u201d, which will eventually fade to nothing anyway, taking you back to where you started.\n\nIf you want your blog to grow - you need to focus your efforts on building passive consistent traffic, which you can get by pushing your articles to the top of Google\u2019s search results. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the first mistake of content promotion: focusing on short-term traffic over backlinks and ranking. \n\nWhat are the other three mistakes?

\n\nFirst of all, your published articles may already have some backlinks, which signals to Google that they are well-trusted and therefore deserve to rank. \n\nHowever, new articles need to be promoted in order to get backlinks to it.\n\nSecondly, your competitors most likely won\u2019t bother updating their content. \n\nSo if the top-ranking articles for your target keyword seem outdated, you can often outrank them by making your article up-to-date and re-publishing it as if it were brand new. \n\nAnd finally, your past articles might simply be targeting the wrong keyword, and therefore not bringing you any traffic. \n\nFiguring out the right searcher intent and re-optimizing your article for the right keyword can do wonders to your search traffic.\n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll learn a basic way to audit your blog content. \n\n#contentaudit #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:34Z","tags":["content audit","how to do a content audit","blog content audit","seo audit","how to do an seo audit","how to do seo audit","seo audit tutorial","seo audit for beginners","how to audit my website","audit a website","basic seo audit","audit for beginners","seo","search engine optimization","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How to do a Content Audit for Your Blog [5.4]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uG1TG6z8Mz4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uG1TG6z8Mz4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uG1TG6z8Mz4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uG1TG6z8Mz4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uG1TG6z8Mz4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT2M57S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5","dislikeCount":"1","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"38","viewCount":"10720"}},{"id":"LSeqUaPMTNE","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to find low competition keyword ideas from all over the web.  \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging Resources\n\nBlogging For Business Course (Complete Playlist) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5kQXogrLN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq&index=1\n\nHow to Find Great Blog Topics to Write About [4.1] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/QLy5mVV__As\n\nHow to Generate Hundreds of Keyword Ideas From Keyword Research Tools [4.2] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/vtERvmC6O2k\n\nHow to Find Keywords Your Competitors are Ranking For [4.3] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/NDoQ20YOS9c\n\nHow to Prioritize Your Content Ideas [4.5] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/xhM7xf8XscU\n\n***************************************\nWhat if you could use a tool and research your entire niche at once?

You didn\u2019t ask for a link directly, but they have linked to your article anyways. \n\nAccording to my definition - that\u2019s not a natural backlink.\n\nYou made a targeted effort towards acquiring a link from that specific website so that link is considered manually built.\n\nBut let\u2019s say you tweeted your newly published article, and one of your Twitter followers linked to it from their website. \n\nIn that case, it is a perfectly natural link. \n\nThis time you didn\u2019t direct your efforts towards that specific person and their specific website. This was a broadcast message to your entire Twitter following.\n\nWithin this simple story lies the \u201csecret\u201d to link acquisition. \n\nWhat\u2019s the secret?

Those are your organic search competitors.\n\nThen, watch the video to learn how to find out what keywords these sites are ranking for, so you can target them too. \n\n#competitorkeywordresearch #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:54Z","tags":["competitor keyword research","competitive keyword research","competitor analysis","competitive analysis","keyword research","seo","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How to Find Keywords Your Competitors are Ranking For [4.3]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NDoQ20YOS9c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NDoQ20YOS9c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NDoQ20YOS9c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NDoQ20YOS9c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NDoQ20YOS9c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT2M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"10","dislikeCount":"3","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"78","viewCount":"15662"}},{"id":"QLy5mVV__As","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to find blog topics to write about by studying your niche. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging Resources\n\nBlogging For Business Course (Complete Playlist) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5kQXogrLN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq&index=1\n\nHow to Generate Hundreds of Keyword Ideas From Keyword Research Tools [4.2] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/vtERvmC6O2k\n\nHow to Find Keywords Your Competitors are Ranking For [4.3] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/NDoQ20YOS9c\n\nHow to Find Low-Hanging Content Ideas [4.4] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/LSeqUaPMTNE\n\nHow to Prioritize Your Content Ideas [4.5] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/xhM7xf8XscU\n\n***************************************\nRegardless of the niche that your business falls into, chances are, a ton of people are talking about it online. \n\nThere might be forums, or different online communities, where your ideal customers are hanging out. \n\nThere might also be groups on Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit or Slack.

And according to our data, the #1 ranking page will rank for about a thousand related keywords in the top 10. \n\nWhich leads us to the following takeaway:\n\nSearch volume of a single keyword is a bad indicator of the total search traffic potential of the article on that topic.\n\nSo, don\u2019t make content marketing decisions based on the search volume of a single keyword. \n\nInstead, you should look at the total search traffic a page is receiving. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\n#keywordresearch #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:44Z","tags":["traffic potential","determine traffic potential of keywords","determine traffic potential of a keyword","search traffic potential","search traffic","search demand","keyword research","seo","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How To Determine The Traffic Potential of a Keyword [3.2]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nFqHWjgM3_U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nFqHWjgM3_U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nFqHWjgM3_U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nFqHWjgM3_U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nFqHWjgM3_U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M50S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"10","dislikeCount":"4","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"77","viewCount":"20753"}},{"id":"vya0PdxuP2s","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to create high-quality content that people want to read, link to and share with others.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging Resources\n\nBlogging For Business Course (Complete Playlist) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5kQXogrLN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq&index=1\n\nWhy Your Blog Content Has to be Great [6.1] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/4qPaHyOQA9c\n\nHow To Create Unique Content That Stands Out [6.3] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q3deuXtXsrw\n\n***************************************\nFrom our experience of building a successful blog at Ahrefs, we\u2019ve figured out a few ingredients that make content great. \n\nThey are:\n\u25ba Quality\n\u25ba Uniqueness\n\u25ba Authority\n\nWhy do these attributes matter?

If your content is weak, even the smartest tactics and strategies won\u2019t work for you.\n\nBut if your content is top-notch, you\u2019ll get astounding results with little to no effort.\n\nWith that said, let\u2019s address the two most common challenges in guest blogging. \n\nFirst, if you can\u2019t find enough guest blogging opportunities. \n\nMost guides to guest blogging suggest using advanced Google search operators for finding blogs to guest post for.\n\nAnd then you\u2019re supposed to somehow scrape Google\u2019s search results for all these search queries, save them into a spreadsheet, run de-duplication and maybe even pull some SEO metrics which would help you vet them.\n\nBut there is a way to get a huge list of guest blogging prospects in 5 minutes or less.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nThe second challenge is that it\u2019s hard to come up with ideas for guest articles. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to come up with a few ideas for a guest article. Any more, and it gets more challenging. \n\nBut there are two advanced techniques you can use to come up with ideas in less time.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn what those two techniques are in this video. \n\n#guestblogging #blogging #seo #bloggingforbusiness\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\nSTAY TUNED:\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\nGoogle+ \u25bahttps:\/\/plus.google.com\/+AhrefsCom\/posts","publishedAt":"2020-04-01T13:50:34Z","tags":["guest blogging","advanced guest blogging tactics","guest blogging tactics","guest blogging strategies","guest blogging tips","guest posting","guest post","guest blog","link building strategies","link building strategy","link building tactics","link building","how to build backlinks","how to get backlinks","build backlinks","get backlinks","seo","search engine optimization","blogging for business","blogging"],"title":"How to Build Backlinks With Advanced Guest Blogging Tactics [9.3]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9Z_vrVCO9Z0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9Z_vrVCO9Z0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9Z_vrVCO9Z0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9Z_vrVCO9Z0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9Z_vrVCO9Z0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M24S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"15","dislikeCount":"1","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"57","viewCount":"8844"}},{"id":"PPzSteaow00","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to find the best keyword to target for your content. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging Resources\n\nBlogging For Business Course (Complete Playlist) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y5kQXogrLN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq&index=1\n\nThe #1 Mistake New Bloggers Make [3.1] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/ikUuEB7k5oE\n\nHow To Determine The Traffic Potential of a Keyword [3.2] \u25ba https:\/\/youtu.be\/nFqHWjgM3_U\n\nKeyword Difficulty: How Hard is it to Rank in Google?

You\u2019ll learn the three most important reasons why you should do this. \n\nNext, share your content on social media. But don\u2019t call it a day after you\u2019ve done that. \n\nThere are a couple of other things you can do to get the most mileage out of social media. And the promotion methods will vary from platform to platform. \n\nSo, you\u2019ll learn what those things are in the tutorial. \n\nThird, email other bloggers you\u2019ve linked to. \n\nIf you\u2019ve created an in-depth guide, chances are you\u2019ve linked to useful resources or mentioned other creators. So, it is worth reaching out to let them know. This can lead to relationships, social shares, and potentially more backlinks. \n\nSam will show you an example of an email you can use in this tutorial. \n\nThe next tip is to submit your post to online communities. These are places like niche forums, Reddit, and Facebook groups.\n\nThese communities are generally tightly knit groups who are interested in a specific topic. \n\nSo by getting your content in front of them, you have the opportunity to drive targeted traffic to your site. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this properly in the tutorial. \n\nNext, answer questions on Quora. Quora is a popular Q&A site. \n\nAnd in 2018, they reached 300 million monthly unique visitors to their site. So, this means you can potentially get your content in front of a lot of people just by answering questions.\n\nBut there is a trick to answering the right questions. You\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\nThe final tip is to use paid ads. \n\nPaid marketing is awesome because once you start paying for traffic, you\u2019ll get it almost immediately. And given the variety of targeting options you have on platforms like Facebook and Google, you can reach new and hyper-targeted audiences quite easily.\n\nAnd finally, build backlinks. \n\nA backlink is when another website links to one of your pages. Google looks at this as a signal that the information being linked to is well trusted.\n\nHow do you build them? You\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\nNow, note that you don\u2019t have to follow every step in this checklist. But generally speaking, the more things you do, the more eyeballs you\u2019ll attract, and the more traffic you\u2019ll get.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:44 Promote to your email list\n1:25 Share the content on social media\n3:18 Email other bloggers you\u2019ve linked to in your content\n3:59 Submit your post to the online communities\n4:55 Start answering questions on Quora\n6:32 Use paid Ads\n7:28 Build backlinks to your content\n\n#contentpromotion #contentpromotionchecklist #contentmarketing\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-05-20T12:30:08Z","tags":["content promotion","content promotion checklist","content promotion plan","content promotion strategies","content promotion strategy","how to promote your content","promote your blog posts","promoting blog posts","promotion strategies","promote your blog content","blog promotion","promote your blog","increase blog traffic","how to promote your blog","how to promote a blog","content marketing","content marketing strategy","social media","blogging","digital marketing","internet marketing"],"title":"Content Promotion Checklist for Beginners","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PoVYweKH4ck\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PoVYweKH4ck\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PoVYweKH4ck\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PoVYweKH4ck\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PoVYweKH4ck\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"103","dislikeCount":"5","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"460","viewCount":"13210"}},{"id":"qcpI17UI_YA","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how Ahrefs\u2019 Keyword Difficulty score works, plus how to tell the difference between a keyword trap and a keyword opportunity. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nHow to Do Keyword Research for a NEW Website (Full Tutorial) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x5IJ0APR0EQ\n\nKeyword Research Tutorial: From Start to Finish (2019) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OMJQPqG2Uas\n\nKeyword Research Tutorials for SEO \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5JCtiYWfvnSvAkoPwg5VY\n\nSimple SEO Strategy: The \u201cMiddleman\u201d Method \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=433XlvMl508\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\n***************************************\nKeyword Difficulty is a numerical representation of how hard it\u2019ll be to rank in Google for a search query.\n\nBut as a standalone metric, it can be misleading. How can a 1 to 3 digit number truly quantify how hard it\u2019ll be to rank in Google?\n\nGoogle uses hundreds of ranking signals, some that they\u2019ve confirmed, some that have been \u201cverified\u201d through third party studies, and then there are ones that SEOs have concluded based on experience, observation or gut feelings.\n\nTo expect a third party with zero association with Google to somehow decrypt 200 some-odd signals and compute an \u201caccurate\u201d metric is unrealistic, or maybe impossible. \n\nAfterall, most of these so-called \u201cranking factors,\u201d are speculation and there are others that can\u2019t even be looked at independently. And for that reason, you\u2019ll notice that keyword difficulty will differ depending on the keyword research tool you\u2019re using. \n\nBut despite its shortcomings, it\u2019s actually a super insightful metric if you understand how it works and how Google chooses which pages to rank. \n\nSo, how does Ahrefs calculate Keyword Difficulty?\n\nSimply put, we take a weighted average of the number of referring domains pointing at the top 10 pages. \n\nSo this means that if a keyword has a high KD, then the ranking pages likely have lots of links pointing at them. In contrast, low KD scores tell us that the top ranking pages don\u2019t have many links.\n\nSince ranking for keywords usually rely on backlinks, KD acts as a good proxy to ranking difficulty. But there are other factors we have to consider.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn what these factors are and how to manually assess the search engine result pages (SERPs) for them. \n\nWhile KD as a standalone metric is far from perfect, there\u2019s actually a ton of utility you can get from it when you use it based on your understanding of the metric.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to use Ahrefs\u2019 Keyword Difficulty to find great topics to target. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:35 What is the keyword difficulty metric\n2:08 How Ahrefs calculates Keyword Difficulty\n2:51 Consider search intent when assessing the KD\n4:17 Take website authority into account\n7:14 Consider the number of quality backlinks\n8:33 Find low-competition topics based on search intent\n11:32 Find link prospects using keywords with high KD scores\n\n#keyworddifficulty #keywordresearch #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-06-03T12:30:09Z","tags":["keyword difficulty","ahrefs keyword difficulty","keyword difficulty ahrefs","keyword difficulty checker","keyword difficulty tool","how difficult to rank in google","how hard is it to rank on google","how to find the competitiveness of a keyword","keyword competition","keyword competition analysis tool","domain strength","keyword analysis","keyword research","how to do keyword research","keyword research for seo","search intent","keyword intent"],"title":"How Reliable are Keyword Difficulty scores?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qcpI17UI_YA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qcpI17UI_YA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qcpI17UI_YA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qcpI17UI_YA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qcpI17UI_YA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M36S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"93","dislikeCount":"10","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"553","viewCount":"14882"}},{"id":"9HWna4hK47c","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to rewrite and republish blog posts to get more organic traffic fast. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging and Content Marketing Resources\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ\n\nKeyword Research Tutorial: From Start to Finish \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OMJQPqG2Uas\n\nHow to Increase Organic Traffic with a Content Audit \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tWNvAGwiVqo\n\nBlogging Tips for Beginners That Actually Work \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ml4mQJjgX6g\n\nHow to Write a Blog Post That Actually Gets Traffic \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-kOT39l0omU\n\nContent Marketing Strategy That Gets Leads and Sales \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9fglNtHmc8I\n\nWhat is Content Marketing and How to Crush It on a Tiny Budget \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4XrtVkhOBfQ\n***************************************\nAs of today, our blog has 250 published posts. And according to Ahrefs\u2019 Content Explorer, 61 pages have been republished at least once. \n\nIf you look at the traffic trends over the past 3 years, you\u2019ll see that nearly all of our republished pages have consistently been gaining more and more search traffic over time. \n\nSo, republishing blog posts works really well as both an SEO and content marketing strategy. \n\nBut when you update content, you can\u2019t just recreate any old page and expect to get a quick boost in organic traffic. There are some requirements in page selection and you actually need to update the content with some thought.\n\nPlus, your website should follow at least the basic SEO best practices.\n\nSo you should have good content, a technically sound website, and have some kind of website authority; meaning, you\u2019re not a new site or have no links pointing at any of your pages. \n\nIf your site matches this criterion, then you can get started with the first step, which is to diagnose pages where your content is responsible for underperformance. \n\nContent is obviously a huge contributor to your ranking success. But it\u2019s not always going to be the main reason why you\u2019re not ranking in the top 3 positions.\n\nSo the first thing we need to do is actually identify that a content issue exists. And there are 4 main things to look out for. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn what these 4 things are in the video. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified a page to update, then it\u2019s time to rewrite it. This requires a bit of research and decision making. \n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll want to do is assess search intent and make sure your page matches it.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the tutorial. \n\nThe next thing you need to do is analyze the top ranking relevant pages.\n\nSince we\u2019ve already pinpointed that we have a content issue rather than a backlinks or technical related one, we need to see what the top ranking pages are doing right. \n\nSo this would require you to manually visit the pages and analyze key points that are being made.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this and which points you should be looking for in other blog posts. \n\nThe last step is to republish your post and make sure Google finds and indexes your new page. You\u2019ll also learn how to do this in the video. \n\nFinally, you should do a content audit of your site to see which pages could benefit from a full-blown update. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:25 Diagnose pages with underperforming content\n02:05 Check what keywords the page is targeting\n3:14 Make sure the page isn\u2019t ranking in Top 3\n5:09 Check if page rankings aren\u2019t related to backlinks\n6:26 Make sure your page matches search intent\n9:11 Analyze the top-ranking relevant pages\n10:31 Analyze the page\u2019s backlink profile\n12:15 Republish the post and submit it for reindexing\n\n#blogging #contentmarketing #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-06-17T12:30:01Z","tags":["republishing blog posts","republishing blog post","how to write a blog post","updating blog post","republishing content","content republishing","updating content","content updating","updating website content","content marketing","content strategy","seo","blogging","digital marketing"],"title":"Republishing Content: How to Update Blog Posts For More Organic Traffic","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9HWna4hK47c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9HWna4hK47c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9HWna4hK47c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9HWna4hK47c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9HWna4hK47c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"110","dislikeCount":"5","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"558","viewCount":"18017"}},{"id":"cl1Ch9ARdQs","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn the three core factors that\u2019ll improve your website\u2019s link authority in a meaningful way.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Link Building Resources\n\n7 Attributes of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E3mDlVutW_o\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step)  \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nWhat are Backlinks and Why are They Important? \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O5L9mBceJ7s\n\nHow to Get Backlinks with Negotiation and Persuasion \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mxusD0K-IYA\n\nHow to Get Backlinks By \u201cStealing\u201d From Low-Quality Pages \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wPjPjNK-bDM&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=3\n\nLink Building for a New Website: 5 Actionable Ways to Get More Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3sF-m5LKCf4 \n\nHow to Build Backlinks WITHOUT Creating New Content \u25ba  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ZAPdyAqzww \n\n***************************************\nIf you\u2019re new to the concept of website authority, it\u2019s actually a made up metric from SEO tool companies. \n\nNow, whether you call it Domain Rating, Domain Authority, website authority, or whatever, they all serve the same general purpose: they try to measure the relative \u201cstrength\u201d of a website\u2019s backlink profile compared to other sites in their index.\n\nNow, while some tools claim that their website authority metric can predict a website\u2019s ranking potential, you should take that with a grain of salt. \n\nSEOs generally agree that website authority does play somewhat of a factor in rankings. However, Google ranks pages and not websites. So having a goal to improve Domain Rating is too broad and could actually make you lose focus from your true goal of ranking in Google and getting more organic traffic.  \n\nBy putting the focus at the website level instead of the page level is like painting your whole house just to make your bathroom look good. It might work to a certain extent, but 90% of your efforts actually have no effect on the end goal.\n\nNow, the things that cause an increase in your website\u2019s authority can help you rank higher in Google. And it all comes down to the main thing responsible for calculating this metric. And that\u2019s links. \n\nSo, let\u2019s expand on Ahrefs\u2019 website authority metric called Domain Rating.\n\nDomain Rating represents the overall strength of a website\u2019s backlink profile. We look at both quantity and quality of the links pointing at a website. It\u2019s plotted on a logarithmic scale from 0 - 100.\n\nWhat are the 3 main things that impact this score? \n\nThey are:\n\n\u25ba number of unique websites that link to you\n\u25ba Domain Ratings of linking domains\n\u25ba number of sites the referring website links to with at least one followed link\n\nHow do you improve your score? You\u2019ll learn how in this video.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:34 - What is website authority?\n2:00 - Ahrefs Domain Rating (DR score)\n3:01 - Impact of referring domains\n3:27 - Why the authority of referring domains matter\n4:35 - Importance of outgoing links from referring domains\n6:39 - Primary things to focus on for better rankings\n\n#domainrating #websiteauthority #linkbuilding\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-07-01T12:30:04Z","tags":["how to increase domain rating","how to increase ahrefs domain rating","how to increase website authority","domain rating","website authority","domain authority","how to increase domain authority","how to increase website domain authority","increase domain authority","high quality backlinks","quality backlinks","quality links","build high quality backlinks","how to build backlinks","how to create backlinks","link building","ahrefs"],"title":"How to Increase Domain Rating (Website Authority)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cl1Ch9ARdQs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cl1Ch9ARdQs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cl1Ch9ARdQs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cl1Ch9ARdQs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cl1Ch9ARdQs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M56S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"203","dislikeCount":"37","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1539","viewCount":"51765"}},{"id":"C5ddo63kHHI","snippet":{"description":"If you\u2019re new to SEO and link building, this complete beginner\u2019s tutorial will teach you the principles and strategies to get powerful and high-quality backlinks in 2020. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Link Building Resources\n\n7 Attributes of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E3mDlVutW_o&\n\nHow to Get Backlinks with Negotiation and Persuasion \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mxusD0K-IYA\n\nGuest Posting at Scale: Get Tons of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aQK1Vbgb-RY\n\nHow to Build Unique Backlinks With Resource Page Link Building \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8f4YTubL6cM&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=5\n\nBroken Link Building in Action (Strategies, Outreach Emails and Stats Revealed) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IOSrx95e4lo\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step)  \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nHow to Get Backlinks By \u201cStealing\u201d From Low-Quality Pages \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wPjPjNK-bDM&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=3\n\nHow to Find Someone\u2019s Email Address (in Seconds) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HA5tLHG80js&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=11\n\nHow to Write Outreach Emails (That Won\u2019t Get Ignored) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nAIWG8883uo&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=2\n***************************************\nLink building is arguably the most challenging part of SEO. It\u2019s a part that requires technical prowess, a creative approach, and just straight up grit and grind. \n\nSo what is link building? \n\nHere\u2019s the standard definition. Link building is the process of getting other websites to link to a page on your website. And these hyperlinks are called backlinks. \n\nHowever, most people can\u2019t seem to get the link building process right. This ultimately boils down to execution. \n\nThe reason why execution is tough is because people focus too much on the end result, i.e. getting backlinks to their pages. The process is actually very relational. And relationships are built by humans, not \u201cborrowed\u201d templates from videos and blog posts. \n\nSo, here\u2019s a better definition: link building is the process of building relationships with other relevant site owners who want and will link to your content because it enhances theirs.\n\nIt includes relationships, relevance, and a value exchange.\n\nSince link building is tough, you need to understand why it\u2019s worth the effort. In short, backlinks are used by search engines like Google to help rank web pages. And the reason for this is something called PageRank. \n\nWhy does PageRank matter and how does PageRank work? You\u2019ll learn all about it in the video. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve understood how PageRank works, you\u2019ll want to know how to get backlinks to your site. \n\nThere are 3 ways to get them. \n\u25ba Create backlinks\n\u25ba Buy backlinks\n\u25ba Earn backlinks\n\nOut of the three, only one of them is truly valuable. In the tutorial, you\u2019ll learn which one that is. \n\nHowever, not all backlinks are good. Only some are really valuable. \n\nTo understand what makes a link good, there are two main categories you should look at. \n\u25ba Relevance\n\u25ba Authoritativeness\n\nIn the video, you\u2019ll learn what these two concepts mean and how you can evaluate links for these two qualities. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve understood everything before this, you\u2019ll want to know what link building strategies you can use. \n\nAnd in the video, we\u2019ll share the link building strategies that actually work. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:41 - What is link building\n1:22 - Main ideas behind link building\n1:55 - What is PageRank\n3:34 - How do you get backlinks\n4:59 - How to define good backlinks\n6:48 - What are Ahrefs Domain and URL ratings\n7:23 - Hyperlink structure and attributes \n10:54 - Definition of a \u2018linkable content\u2019\n12:52 - Importance of a \u2018pitch\u2019 for the outreach\n15:38 - Guest blogging\n16:31 - Resource page link building\n17:38 - Broken link building\n18:35 - Link building with HARO\n\n#linkbuildingforbeginners #linkbuilding #backlinks\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-07-15T12:30:01Z","tags":["link building","link building for beginners","link building strategies","link building strategy","how to create backlinks","how to build backlinks","seo link building","how to get backlinks","how to make backlinks","high quality backlinks","find backlinks","get backlinks","backlinks for beginners","seo backlinks","backlink","backlinks","off page seo","seo for beginners","seo","search engine optimization"],"title":"Link Building for Beginners: Complete Guide to Get Backlinks in 2020","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C5ddo63kHHI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C5ddo63kHHI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C5ddo63kHHI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C5ddo63kHHI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C5ddo63kHHI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"155","dislikeCount":"45","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1656","viewCount":"57517"}},{"id":"eTF6OBwidhc","snippet":{"description":"In part 1 of our 3-part series, you\u2019ll learn how to strategically write a blog post that generates links.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Content Marketing Resources\n\nLink Bait Case Study (SEO Stats Post) [Complete Playlist] \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y\n\n[Episode 2] Link Building Case Study: Results of 515 Outreach Emails \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gMcA-8nalL8&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y&index=2\n\n[Episode 3] Link Building with Google Ads: Results from $1,245 in PPC Ads \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Uz2bGhdnJN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y&index=3\n\nSimple SEO Strategy: The \u201cMiddleman\u201d Method \u25ba  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=433XlvMl508 \n\nHow to Write a Blog Post That Actually Gets Traffic \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-kOT39l0omU\n\nBlogging Tips for Beginners That Actually Work \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ml4mQJjgX6g\n\nContent Marketing Strategy That Gets Leads and Sales \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9fglNtHmc8I\n\nContent Marketing and Blogging Tutorials \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5dP7r3VJY_RXCQ84StTXv\n\n***************************************\nWe have tons of videos on content marketing, blogging and link building. But how is creating a blog post and link building connected?\n\nThere are a few facets to this. \n\nOne, content quality. It\u2019s easier to get links to a piece of high-quality content than one that\u2019s mediocre. \n\nTwo, search intent. Why are people searching for the topic? Do the searchers have the ability and power to link to your site? \n\nThird, timing. Even if you have an amazing blog post, it doesn\u2019t equate to links if it reaches people at the wrong time. \n\nWith the three facets explained, how do you turn that into a formula for writing a blog post that will attract links? \n\nThe first thing to do is to find a topic that is \u201clink-worthy\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nAfter you\u2019ve found the topic you want to target, the next thing to do is to create the blog post. \n\nIn this case, we\u2019re trying to create a stats page. But it\u2019s tough to make a page of stats truly standout amongst other pages. They\u2019re all going to be curated lists and there\u2019s definitely going to be overlap between competing pages.\n\nSo, how do you make one that\u2019s different and people want to link to?\n\nYou\u2019ll learn the exact steps we followed to create the perfect stats blog post in the video. \n\nAnd with the blog post created, it\u2019s time to try building links to it. And this is what we\u2019ll be doing in part 2 of the series, which is the next video. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:06 How content and links are related\n3:22 Find a proven topic that\u2019s link-worthy\n5:13 Create a page on that topic\n6:29 Analyze backlink profiles of the competing pages\n\n#howtowriteablogpost #contentmarketing #blogging\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-07-29T12:30:06Z","tags":["how to write a stats blog post","how to write a blog post","how to write a blog","how to write a blog for beginners","how to write a blog post for beginners","how to write a blog post that attracts backlinks","link bait","linkbait","blog writing","blog post","how to write seo content","how to blog","blogging","blogging tips","content marketing","seo"],"title":"How to Write a Blog Post That Attracts Backlinks (Case Study) [Ep 1]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eTF6OBwidhc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eTF6OBwidhc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eTF6OBwidhc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eTF6OBwidhc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eTF6OBwidhc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"89","dislikeCount":"6","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"656","viewCount":"19175"}},{"id":"gMcA-8nalL8","snippet":{"description":"In part 2 of our 3-part series, you\u2019ll learn the exact link building process we used to build backlinks to our stats page.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Link Building Resources\n\nLink Bait Case Study (SEO Stats Post) [Complete Playlist] \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y\n\n[Episode 1] How to Write a Blog Post That Attracts Backlinks (Case Study) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eTF6OBwidhc&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y&index=1\n\n[Episode 3] Link Building with Google Ads: Results from $1,245 in PPC Ads \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Uz2bGhdnJN0&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y&index=3\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nHow to Get Backlinks By \u201cStealing\u201d From Low-Quality Pages \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wPjPjNK-bDM\n\nHow to Get Backlinks with Negotiation and Persuasion \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mxusD0K-IYA\n\n7 Attributes of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E3mDlVutW_o&\n\nLink Building with Google Sheets: Start Guest Posting in 15 Minutes \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bwYZGWDlQd8&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=3\n\nHow to Find Someone\u2019s Email Address (in Seconds) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HA5tLHG80js&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=11\n\nHow to Write Outreach Emails (That Won\u2019t Get Ignored) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nAIWG8883uo&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m&index=2\n\n***************************************\nIf you\u2019re new to this series, our first video was about strategically building a statistics page that would generate links. And in this video, we\u2019ll show you how we built links to that page. \n\nIn order to isolate backlinks from our email outreach efforts, we didn\u2019t promote the post to our existing audience. On top of that, we hid it from our blog index and category pages, RSS feeds, and we even noindexed the page so it couldn\u2019t be discovered in search. \n\nThat simply means that the post was practically invisible unless we sent you an outreach email.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll learn what our results are in the video. \n\nSo, how did we execute the campaign? You\u2019ll learn exactly what and how we did in the video, but here\u2019s a brief overview:\n\u25ba Get a list of link prospects\n\u25ba Look for reasons why people were linking to the competing stats pages\n\u25ba Do a clean up of our prospects list\n\u25ba Remove prospects based on link attributes and the page\u2019s SEO metrics.\n\u25ba Write our outreach template and create personalization fields for each contact. \n\nWe also got a few takeaways from our link building process, and we share those takeaways in the video too. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n2:30 Assessing the quality of the links\n4:42 Get a list of link prospects\n5:13 Look for reasons why people are linking\n7:30 Do a clean up of a prospects list and automate\n10:36 Write an outreach template and create personalization fields for the contacts \n13:03 Revising the results of the outreach campaign\n15:23 Key takeaways and shortcomings\n\n#linkbuildingcasestudy #linkbuilding #outreach\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-08-05T14:01:53Z","tags":["link building case study","link building","link building strategy","seo link building","how to build backlinks","how to get backlinks","how to get quality backlinks","get backlinks","build backlinks","high quality backlinks","seo backlinks","backlink"],"title":"Link Building Case Study: Results of 515 Outreach Emails [Ep. 2]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMcA-8nalL8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMcA-8nalL8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMcA-8nalL8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMcA-8nalL8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMcA-8nalL8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M32S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"144","dislikeCount":"6","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"404","viewCount":"13182"}},{"id":"Uz2bGhdnJN0","snippet":{"description":"In part 3 of our 3-part series, you\u2019ll learn the process and results from our link building experiment where we tried to build links via PPC advertising.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Link Building Resources\n\nLink Bait Case Study (SEO Stats Post) [Complete Playlist] \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y\n\n[Episode 1] How to Write a Blog Post That Attracts Backlinks (Case Study) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eTF6OBwidhc&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y&index=1\n\n[Episode 2] Link Building Case Study: Results of 515 Outreach Emails \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gMcA-8nalL8&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u_ABxIRO6RVK3ucKyzn96Y&index=2\n\nLink Building for Beginners: Complete Guide to Get Backlinks in 2020 \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C5ddo63kHHI \n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\n7 Attributes of High Quality Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E3mDlVutW_o&\n\nLink Building for a New Website: 5 Actionable Ways to Get More Backlinks \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3sF-m5LKCf4\n\n***************************************\nIf you\u2019re new to this series, our first video was about strategically building a statistics page that would generate links. And in our second video, we showed you how we built links to that page. \n\nAnd now, in this episode, we tried to see if PPC advertising is a viable link building strategy. \n\nBut before we show you the results of the campaigns, it\u2019s important to get some context on how this series began. \n\nBasically, Tim, our CMO introduced a concept called the \u201cthe vicious circle of SEO\u201d. This happens when people search for something and read the #1 result. Some of them will link to that page from their own websites. And because of the new links, that #1 page stays at the top, creating a virtually endless loop of total domination.\n\nAnd since for many queries, there are Google Ads at the top, we thought, why not pay for ads and see if we could earn links? \n\nSo, we decided to run our first experiment to see if we could get backlinks to a page. Here\u2019s what we did. \n\n\u25ba We created a duplicate version of an existing case study.\n\u25ba We noindexed that page to make it invisible to everyone, except those who saw the ad. \n\u25ba We set up a simple search campaign in Google Ads\n\nYou\u2019ll see our experiment set-up, plus the results of our link building experiment in the video. \n\nGiven the relative success of our first experiment, we decided to run a second PPC campaign to see if we could get more links. Here\u2019s what we did. \n\n\u25ba We created a list of stats (documented in part 1 and 2)\n\u25ba We set up a simple search campaign in Google Ads.\n\nYou\u2019ll see our experiment set-up, the results and our takeaways in the video. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n1:23 How to beat \u201cThe Vicious circle of SEO\u201d\n5:10 Setting up the ad campaign for an old post\n5:48 Analysing the links we got from the ads\n8:28 Experimenting with ads for a stats page\n12:09 Is running ads for generating links worth it?\n\n#linkbuildingcasestudy #linkbuilding #linkbuildingwithgoogleads\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-08-12T12:30:06Z","tags":["link building with Google ads","link building case study","link building with PPC","PPC link building","Google ads link building","link building","link building strategy","seo link building","how to build backlinks","how to get backlinks","how to get quality backlinks","get backlinks","build backlinks","high quality backlinks","seo backlinks","backlink","backlinks"],"title":"Link Building with Google Ads: Results from $1,245 in PPC Ads [Ep. 3]","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uz2bGhdnJN0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uz2bGhdnJN0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uz2bGhdnJN0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uz2bGhdnJN0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uz2bGhdnJN0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M52S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"162","dislikeCount":"16","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"879","viewCount":"31896"}},{"id":"s5VZaXi7RF4","snippet":{"description":"In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to do keyword research for your affiliate site and find revenue-generating topics.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nAffiliate Marketing for Beginners: Complete Tutorial for 2020 \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W-nbsnXtSZI \n\nHow to Do Keyword Research for a NEW Website (Full Tutorial) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x5IJ0APR0EQ\n\nKeyword Research Tutorial: From Start to Finish \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OMJQPqG2Uas\n\nKeyword Research Tips to Help you Rank Higher in Google \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b7PzHO40bOU\n\nKeyword Research Tutorials for SEO \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5JCtiYWfvnSvAkoPwg5VY\n\nSimple SEO Strategy: The \u201cMiddleman\u201d Method \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=433XlvMl508\n\n***************************************\nNot all traffic to your website will lead to affiliate commissions. And you shouldn\u2019t forcefully plug products just for the sake of getting an affiliate commission either. \n\nPeople won\u2019t click a link just because it\u2019s there.\n\nYou need to find topics that a) get searched in Google, YouTube or whatever search engine you\u2019re optimizing for and b) topics where it\u2019s natural to plug product recommendations.\n\nIf you\u2019re new as an affiliate marketer, you\u2019ll need to understand search intent. And in the video, you\u2019ll learn what that is and why that is important to affiliate marketing. \n\nOnce you understand the concept of search intent, you\u2019ll learn about the 4 different types of affiliate marketing keywords.\n\nThey are:\n\u25ba General comparisons\n\u25ba Branded comparisons\n\u25ba Product reviews\n\u25ba T&A\n\nThe first type of keywords are general comparisons. \n\nThese are your typical \u201cBest [product name]\u201d keywords. And these types of affiliate keywords are super easy to recommend products because that\u2019s essentially what the post is about. The keyword, \u201cbest\u201d implies that there are comparisons that need to be made. \n\nOn top of that, people searching for these \u201cbest product name\u201d keywords are likely in the market to purchase something in the near future.\n\nThe second type of keywords are branded comparisons. These are keywords where a searcher wants to compare the differences between two branded products.\n\nThese types of keywords usually have lower search demand, but they convert well because the searcher has likely narrowed down their purchase decision to a few products.\n\nThe third type of keywords are detailed product reviews.\n\nSearchers that are looking for reviews on these topics are probably close to making a purchase. They\u2019ve researched multiple products, and now they want a more in-depth review on one of the products.\n\nThe last type of keywords are Trust & Authority keywords, aka T & A. \n\nThey don\u2019t directly contribute to your affiliate revenue, but they serve an important purpose. You need backlinks to rank your pages, but most of your pages are commercial in nature, which makes it tough to get links. \n\nSo, you\u2019ll need these topics to acquire links and build up your page-level and website authority. \n\nAnd in this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to find all four types of keywords in any affiliate niche. \n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs\n\n#keywordresearchforaffiliatemarketing #keywordresearch #affiliatemarketing","publishedAt":"2020-08-26T12:30:10Z","tags":["keyword research for affiliate marketing","keyword research for affiliate site","affiliate keyword research","affiliate marketing keyword research","affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing for beginners","start affiliate marketing","how to start affiliate marketing","how to get started affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing tutorial","keyword research","keyword research tutorial"],"title":"Keyword Research Tips for Affiliate Marketing Sites in 2020","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s5VZaXi7RF4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s5VZaXi7RF4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s5VZaXi7RF4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s5VZaXi7RF4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s5VZaXi7RF4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M48S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"173","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1219","viewCount":"30200"}},{"id":"ipTk-qGrNlc","snippet":{"description":"In today\u2019s video, we\u2019re introducing our new free SEO tool: Ahrefs Webmaster Tools.

Plus, there\u2019s limited advice on how to fix those issues. \n\nSo we created Ahrefs Webmaster Tools to fill the gap. \n\nAhrefs Webmaster Tools is a completely free SEO tool that will give you a holistic view of how your website is performing in search.\n\nAnd more than just \u201cknowing how you\u2019re doing,\u201d we provide actionable insights, tips, and strategies right within our toolset so you can actually get tangible results.\n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll get a quick tour of what you\u2019ll get in Ahrefs Webmaster Tools. \n\nFirst, you\u2019ll need to get yourself an account. So, go to ahrefs.com\/awt and sign up for a free Webmaster Tools account. Then, follow the steps in the video to verify your website with Google Search Console. \n\nThere are two parts to Ahrefs Webmaster Tools. First is our website audit tool called Site Audit. \n\nSite Audit allows you to scan for over 100 issues that could potentially be hurting your website\u2019s performance in search. And within it, you\u2019ll be able to see the website\u2019s Health Score, a breakdown of the top issues we found on the site, and the number of URLs that have the issue. \n\nAnd since some of these issues may be foreign to you, we also provide details on what the issues are and how to fix them. \n\nThere are a ton of things you can do with our Site Audit tool, so watch the video to find out the cool things you can do. \n\nThe second part of AWT is Site Explorer, which gives you a look into backlink and search traffic data. \n\nSince Ahrefs crawls the web in a similar way as Google, we\u2019re able to collect a ton of raw data and present it in an easy to digest way.\n\nIn short, this tool lets you see important information like... the pages that link to you, the pages they\u2019re linking to, and SEO metrics which can help you understand the influence they might have on your pages. \n\nIn addition, we show you all of the keywords your website ranks for broken down by country. \n\nAnd similarly, there are tons of things you can do with Site Explorer, so make sure you watch the video to learn how. \n\nSo you might be wondering why Ahrefs is all of a sudden opening free access to some of Ahrefs\u2019 tools, while tens of thousands of SEOs are happily paying to get access to this data?\n\nWell, not all websites are intended to make money, but that doesn't mean they don't have great content that deserves to be found.\n\nAnd that's what we want to help you do by giving you solid data, tools, and learning materials to keep your site in good health.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve been hesitating to get a premium Ahrefs account, then now you can sign up for AWT for free. And if you require more data for other sites, you can always upgrade your account to get full access to all of our SEO tools. \n\n#ahrefswebmastertools #awt #ahrefs\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-09-22T12:30:03Z","tags":["ahrefs webmaster tools","ahrefs","AWT","webmaster tools","google search console","search console","google webmaster tools","google webmaster","seo tools","seo tool","best seo tools","free seo tools","seo free tools","seo tools free","top free seo tools","seo","search engine optimization"],"title":"Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (AWT) - Our Free SEO Tool","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipTk-qGrNlc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipTk-qGrNlc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipTk-qGrNlc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipTk-qGrNlc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipTk-qGrNlc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"259","dislikeCount":"31","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1256","viewCount":"34268"}},{"id":"BrY6a-lsLp8","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to speed up your WordPress website in 3 simple steps.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nWordpress SEO Tutorial for Beginners (Search Engine Optimization Basics) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jN_xx9jGDVc\n\nWordpress SEO: Advanced Technical SEO Made Easy \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=du-NB9FqVis\n\nA Basic (Yet Powerful) Technical SEO Audit for Beginners \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oJPGa0J6p5Q\n\nSEO Audit: How to Fix Your Website\u2019s Technical SEO Issues (Tutorial) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=G_9-AkZch4k\n\nThe Best WordPress SEO Plugins (It\u2019s Not Yoast) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cFI_jRVOQZk\n\nSEO Tips to Improve Organic Traffic in Under 15 Minutes \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=73lj6m6Xulc\n\n***************************************\nGoogle has used site speed as a ranking signal for desktop searches since 2010. And as of 2018, page speed became a ranking factor for mobile searches. \n\nEven though speed improvements will only affect a small percentage of slow websites, faster page load times lead to better user experience and ultimately, more revenue.\n\nSo, there are a number of reasons why your website might load slowly. But the most common reasons that I\u2019ve seen are due to slow connectivity, caching, page size, and sometimes more technical reasons like render blocking JS. \n\nAnd the 3 steps in this video should help you get better performance from your site. But keep in mind that the things we did for this site won\u2019t necessarily translate perfectly to your site.\n\nThis is because there are tons of things to consider when it comes to WordPress site speed like your theme\u2019s code, specific plugins you might be using, server configuration, image file sizes and more. \n\nBefore you do anything, run your site through some site speed checking tools, like Google\u2019s PageSpeed Insights, Pingdom, GTMetrix or our own Site Audit tool. \n\nThis will help you see what you need to improve. \n\nThe first thing we did was to switch DNS providers to Cloudflare\u2019s free DNS service.\n\nAnd you\u2019ll learn how this works and why this is important in the video. \n\nThe next thing we did was purchase and install the WP Rocket plugin. \n\nWP Rocket is an all-in-one site speed optimization plugin for WordPress. The plugin handles common page speed optimizations like caching, preloading, compression, and lazy loads images to name a few. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn what you need to do after installing WPRocket on your site. \n\nAnd finally, we optimized our images.\n\nThe simple solution is to compress your images using lossy or lossless compression. And there are some great plugins that\u2019ll do this for you like ShortPixel and Imagify. \n\nAnd these 3-steps gave us a huge improvement, as shown in the speed checking tools we used. \n\nIf you\u2019re still unhappy with your site speed after making these optimizations, then you\u2019ll likely need more custom work done for you. So you may want to consider removing plugins and scripts, switching themes, or hiring a developer to make the appropriate fixes. \n\n#speedupyourwordpresswebsite #pagespeed #technicalseo\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:58 Common reasons that impact website\u2019s load time\n1:50 Run a test through page-speed testing tools\n3:01 Switch to a fast DNS provider\n5:23 Start with caching files\n6:05 Optimize CSS files\n7:41 Set up JS files loading\n8:50 Optimize the media files\n9:10 Set up preloading priority\n9:49 Use CDN\n11:09 Optimize your images\n\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-10-07T12:30:01Z","tags":["how to speed up your wordpress website","speed up wordpress website","speed up wordpress","wordpress speed optimization","how to speed up your website","wordpress speed optimization plugin","make wordpress faster","wordpress website speed","how to make wordpress site faster","how to speed up wordpress website","how to make wordpress website faster","improve website speed","increase website speed","how to speed up wordpress","how to make website load faster","wordpress seo"],"title":"How to Speed Up Your WordPress Website in 2020 (Simple Guide)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BrY6a-lsLp8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BrY6a-lsLp8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BrY6a-lsLp8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BrY6a-lsLp8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BrY6a-lsLp8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M3S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"549","dislikeCount":"115","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5811","viewCount":"150062"}},{"id":"BAnEGLpxkYU","snippet":{"description":"In this video, we\u2019ll show you five of our best free SEO tools and how you can use them together to improve SEO for your site. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ\n\nKeyword Research Tutorials For SEO \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5JCtiYWfvnSvAkoPwg5VY \n\nOn-Page SEO Checklist for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gDYjjkvtOVo&\n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nAhrefs Webmaster Tools \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/webmaster-tools \n\nBacklink Checker \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/backlink-checker \n\nKeyword Generator \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/keyword-generator \n\nSERP Checker \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/serp-checker \n\nAhrefs\u2019 SEO Toolbar \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/seo-toolbar \n\n***************************************\nOver the past year, we\u2019ve released around 14 free SEO tools. So, this tutorial is going to show you how to use them together and hopefully gain some traction from organic search. \n\nThe first free SEO tool is Ahrefs\u2019 Webmaster Tools or AWT. AWT includes two of our core tools and will work for any websites you own. The first tool in AWT is Site Audit, which will scan your website for over 100 technical and on-page SEO issues and organize them into digestible reports.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure of what to do with these issues, we also provide details on what the issues are and how to fix them.\n\nThe second tool in AWT is Site Explorer, which lets you check backlinks and search traffic data. \n\nIn Site Explorer, you\u2019ll see top-level metrics for your website like, Domain Rating, total backlinks, total referring domains, which are just unique websites that link to you, the number of keywords your site ranks for, and the estimated search traffic to your website.\n\nYou\u2019ll also see an interactive graph that shows how fast you\u2019re acquiring backlinks from unique websites, which is a good indicator of your website\u2019s popularity on the web.\n\nSite Explorer also allows you to see the keywords your website ranks for. Just go to the organic keywords report and you\u2019ll see the keywords you\u2019re ranking for, their search volumes, keyword difficulty scores, and the positions we saw these pages ranking in on this date.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to use these tools in the video. \n\nThe next free SEO tool is Ahrefs Backlink Checker.\n\nWith our free backlink checker tool, you can see the top 100 backlinks pointing at a URL or domain. \n\nHow do you use our Backlink Checker tool? You\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\nThe next free SEO tool is Ahrefs\u2019 Keyword Generator.\n\nThis tool lets you find keyword ideas for search engines like Google, Bing, YouTube, and Amazon. Just select your search engine and enter a broad keyword related to your niche.\n\nWe\u2019ll then show you the top 100 keywords that include your phrase along with search volumes and keyword difficulty scores for the top 10 keywords.\n\nIt\u2019s best if you can combine the next free SEO tool with Keyword Generator. And that tool is Ahrefs\u2019 SERP Checker. \n\nSERP checker shows you the top 10 rankings PLUS the SEO metrics for the top 3 pages. And beyond metrics, you can see non-personalized search results from 171 countries. \n\nHow do you use SERP Checker and Keyword Generator together? You\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\nAnd finally, the last free SEO tool is Ahrefs\u2019 SEO Toolbar.\n\nIt allows you to see redirect paths and HTTP headers for any page,  scan pages for broken outgoing links, see an on-page SEO report, and more.\n\nTimestamps\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:34 How Ahrefs Webmaster Tool (AWT) works\n4:44 See competitors links with Ahrefs Backlink Checker\n5:32 Find keywords with Ahrefs Keywords Generator\n6:18 Review Google\u2019s top pages with Ahrefs SERP Checker\n7:07 Check SEO metrics with Ahrefs SEO Toolbar\n\n#freeseotools #seotools #ahrefs\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-10-21T12:30:01Z","tags":["seo tools","ahrefs free seo tools","best seo tools","the best seo tools","seo tool","search engine optimization tools","top free seo tools","seo tools free","seo free tools","seo","search engine optimization","ahrefs","free seo tools"],"title":"5 Free SEO Tools by Ahrefs to Improve SEO","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BAnEGLpxkYU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BAnEGLpxkYU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BAnEGLpxkYU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BAnEGLpxkYU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BAnEGLpxkYU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"162","dislikeCount":"24","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"938","viewCount":"23134"}},{"id":"MAikiySP5Yc","snippet":{"description":"This video debunks some of the most common SEO myths and suggests what you should do instead.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ \n\nRepublishing Content: How to Update Blog Posts For More Organic Traffic \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9HWna4hK47c \n\nAhrefs Webmaster Tools (AWT) - Our Free SEO Tool \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ipTk-qGrNlc \n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m\n\nLink Building with Google Ads: Results from $1,245 in PPC Ads [Ep. 3] \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Uz2bGhdnJN0 \n\nSEO Checklist: How to Get More Organic Traffic (Step-by-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=taU9P98zfjk\n\nOn Page SEO Checklist for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gDYjjkvtOVo\n\n***************************************\nMost myths are harmless. But the same can\u2019t be said for most SEO myths. So, we need to bust these common myths and get you focused on tactics and strategies that\u2019ll move the needle. \n\nThe first myth we need to debunk is that SEO is dead. \n\nJournalists like to say that many things are dead. These kinds of headlines often lead to opinion editorials that end up being nothing more than clickbait. \n\nSEO is alive and well. How do we know that?\n\nYou\u2019ll find out in the video. \n\nThe second myth is that Google only ranks \u201cfresh\u201d content.\n\nDoes Google rank fresh content? Of course. But Google also ranks content that hasn\u2019t been updated in years. \n\nThe thing is: freshness is a query-dependant ranking factor. That means fresh content matters for some search queries, but not so much for others. \n\nLearn how to tell when a query relies on freshness in the video. \n\nThe third myth is that duplicate content will get you penalized.\n\nDuplicate content is exact or near-duplicate content that appears on the web in more than one place. But there is no such thing as a duplicate content penalty.\n\nThe thing is: Google and its representatives have said on numerous occasions that Google doesn\u2019t have a duplicate content penalty.  \n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean duplicate content is good for your site.\n\nWhy? Find out in the video (plus, how to find and fix this issue.)\n\nThe fourth myth is that SEO is a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d job.\n\nWhile SEO can lead to free, passive, and consistent traffic that doesn\u2019t fade over time, it doesn\u2019t mean that you can simply rank your pages and call it a day. \n\nSEO is like going to the gym. It\u2019s ok to miss a workout here and there, but you have to go consistently in order to get and maintain those results. \n\nIf you choose to ignore all efforts after you\u2019re ranking high, you\u2019ll likely lose backlinks while your competitors are building them. Your content will get stale for queries that rely on a freshness factor.\n\nThe fifth myth is that social shares help you rank higher in Google.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to believe that the more your content gets shared on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest, the higher those pages will rank. But Google\u2019s John Mueller has said that social signals don\u2019t directly impact rankings.\n\nLearn why this myth persists in the video. \n\nThe sixth myth is that Pay Per Click Advertising won\u2019t help you rank higher in search.\n\nPaying for ads doesn't directly influence rankings. Google won't rank you higher in organic search just because you're paying them.\n\nBut PPC can indirectly help your pages get more backlinks because of increased exposure, just like social shares.\n\nHow? Watch the video to find out. \n\nAnd the final myth we\u2019re busting is that SEO is always about ranking #1.\n\nWe all want top Google rankings. But there's a point where boosting your position for a single keyword may not be worth the required time and effort.\n\nWhy? You\u2019ll find out in the video. \n\nNow, these aren\u2019t the only SEO myths that are out there. There are more to cover. But when you understand why these myths are not to be believed, you\u2019ll be better off with your SEO strategies. \n\nTimestamps\n\n0:26 #1 SEO is dead\n1:36 #2 Google only ranks \u201cfresh\u201d content\n3:06 #3 Duplicate content gets you penalized\n4:43 #4 SEO is the \u201cset it and forget it\u201d job\n5:26 #5 Social shares help you rank higher\n6:32 #6 PPC Ads won\u2019t help you rank higher\n7:12 #7 SEO is about ranking #1 in Google\n\n#seomyths #seo #searchengineoptimization\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-11-04T13:30:02Z","tags":["seo myths","seo mythbusting","common seo myths","myths in seo","seo misconceptions","seo myth","seo myths debunked","seo myths google","seo 101","seo tips","seo","search engine optimization","seo for beginners"],"title":"Common SEO Myths Busted","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MAikiySP5Yc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MAikiySP5Yc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MAikiySP5Yc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MAikiySP5Yc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MAikiySP5Yc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M47S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"106","dislikeCount":"9","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"640","viewCount":"14927"}},{"id":"NR_V2nGSp98","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to get more YouTube subscribers fast and consistently with a simple 4-step framework.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Video SEO Resources\n\nYouTube SEO \/ Video Marketing \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tsn8vwEmhFM0McBH4PhEty \n\nYouTube SEO: How to Rank Your Videos #1 \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NY3y0V9UDwM&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tsn8vwEmhFM0McBH4PhEty&index=4\n\nHow to Get More Views on YouTube (Even With 0 Subscribers) \u25ba  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iwkUlTl2Iow&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tsn8vwEmhFM0McBH4PhEty&index=2\n\nYouTube Keyword Research: How to Get More Views Consistently \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kAuM2nQb_P8&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tsn8vwEmhFM0McBH4PhEty&index=3\n\nHow to Edit YouTube Videos for High Engagement \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j5EOWffq-gk&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tsn8vwEmhFM0McBH4PhEty&index=5\n\nHow to use Video Marketing to Grow Your Business \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QCgDIhvFkCM \n\nVideo SEO: How to Rank YouTube Videos on the First Page of Google (Fast) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BObU_VCwnvY&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tsn8vwEmhFM0McBH4PhEty&index=1 \n\n***************************************\nMany videos on getting subscribers on YouTube will recommend doing things like adding subscribe buttons to end screens, asking people to subscribe within the video or email your existing audience to tell them about your YouTube channel. \n\nBut none of these will make any difference if nobody is watching your videos in the first place, especially for those who are trying to get their first 100 or even 1,000 subscribers.\n\nSo you need to focus on creating a \u201csubscribe-worthy\u201d YouTube channel that will lead to an engaged and loyal audience for the long haul.\n\nBefore you begin, you need to understand two important fundamentals:\n\n\u25ba Understanding why people subscribe\n\u25ba Know how YouTube works on a basic level\n\nYou\u2019ll learn about these two fundamentals in more depth in the video. \n\nOnce you understand these two fundamentals on a deep level, then you can begin to apply the 4-step framework from this video.\n\nStep one is to laser in on your channel\u2019s theme. \n\nA theme or niche is what connects you with your audience. It\u2019s a common interest between you and your subscribers.\n\nAnd to continue nurturing that relationship, you need to publish relevant content within your theme to engage that audience and have YouTube promote it to similar audiences. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nStep two is focusing on both content quality and format. \n\nIt goes without saying that your content needs to be good. But \u201cgood\u201d has nothing to do with your camera gear or production value. A good video is simply content that serves the viewer\u2019s wants or needs in the format they prefer. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the tutorial. \n\nStep three is discovery.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect people to magically discover your videos. You\u2019ll need to help them do it. How?

SOPs are detailed documents that explain how to carry out a task from start to finish.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been to any McDonald\u2019s around the world, you\u2019ll learn that the experience anywhere, no matter in which country, is almost exactly the same. And this is due to SOPs. \n\nFor each new hire, they\u2019ll get both in-person training as well as a handbook. The handbook covers how to do literally everything from greeting the customer at the drive-thru window, to kitchen responsibilities, and even how you should handle money.\n\nAnd this is how you want to create your SOPs. Don\u2019t assume that people you hire know your expectations. Outline every last detail to the point of visualization. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to do this in the video. \n\nThe second step in the framework is hiring freelancers.\n\nPeople often look for one freelancer to do everything. And while there are people who are good at many facets of SEO, doing everything alone is time-consuming, and just straight up inefficient -- especially if you have the resources to hire a team. \n\nWhen you hire people to take over specific tasks, they become masters of that task. The quality of their work improves rather than deteriorates because they\u2019ve been spread too thin.\n\nHow does Sam do the hiring? Watch the video to find out.\n\nFinally, the third step is to systematize your workflow.\n\nEven if you\u2019re only outsourcing one facet of SEO, it\u2019s still a complicated business with lots of moving parts. And that\u2019s why you need a project management tool to keep track of everything.\n\nThis video will teach you how to use Kanban boards to create a successful project management system. \n\nSEO outsourcing is hard at first. But when you put in the initial grunt work you\u2019re setting up a foundation to repeatedly do good SEO for your site. And as you and your team can continually refine and update your SOPs scaling any process gets even easier.\n\nYou just need to hire more people where help is needed, onboard them with your SOPs, and the system will continue to work for you. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:38 Benefits to outsourcing SEO tasks\n1:18 Create SOPs\n4:36 Hire freelancers\n8:13 Systematize your workflow\n\n#howtooutsourceSEO #outsourcing #SEO\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-12-02T13:30:03Z","tags":["how to outsource SEO","outsource SEO","seo outsourcing","how to outsource content creation","how to start outsourcing","how to outsource","outsource","seo","search engine optimization"],"title":"How to Outsource SEO (Step-by-Step)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FniG4vfbWJA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FniG4vfbWJA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FniG4vfbWJA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FniG4vfbWJA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FniG4vfbWJA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M7S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"100","dislikeCount":"10","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"505","viewCount":"14980"}},{"id":"iZwr2mAmIxE","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to use Google ads to improve SEO on both Google and YouTube. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional SEO Resources\n\nWhat is SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and How Does it Work? \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R-XxAk8-OXY&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2uHtGoHf8K06ebr-TIrgM0G&index=2 \n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2uHtGoHf8K06ebr-TIrgM0G&index=2\n\nLink Building with Google Ads: Results from $1,245 in PPC Ads [Ep. 3] \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Uz2bGhdnJN0 \n\nSEO Tips to Improve Organic Traffic in Under 15 Minutes \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=73lj6m6Xulc \n\nHow to use Google Search Console to Improve Your SEO \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FXVEb_eklhk\n\n***************************************\nKeeping SEO and PPC separate is a mistake. You\u2019re missing out on a ton of reliable data that can be used for SEO to gain the long-term benefits of free and passive search traffic from Google and YouTube.\n\nThe first use case is to find keywords that result in conversions. \n\nNot every keyword you bid on or rank for is going to result in customers. But Google Ads has a conversion tracking feature that lets you attribute an action on your website to a keyword. \n\nHow do you use this feature to find keywords that convert well? You\u2019ll learn how in the video. \n\nThe next use case is to find keyword opportunities and pages that can benefit from on-page optimizations. \n\nAccording to Google, 15% of queries they see every day have never been seen before. That means billions of queries are going unnoticed and if Google doesn\u2019t even know them, then third-party keyword research tools probably won\u2019t either.\n\nHow do you use this knowledge to find keyword opportunities? Watch the video to find out. \n\nThe next use case is to improve click-through rates on your organic search result. \n\nIt\u2019s widely believed that a higher click-through rate can lead to improved rankings. But even if it doesn\u2019t, more clicks equals more visitors. \n\nNow, since search ads allow you to manipulate the title and description, you can try different versions of ad copy to try and find a winning combination. \n\nHow do you do this? You\u2019ll learn how in the video.\n\nThe next use case is to get backlinks by advertising for queries with \u201clink intent.\u201d \n\nSome pages will naturally earn links consistently simply because they rank at the top of Google. And that\u2019s one of the huge benefits to Google search ads. You can pay to have your page appear at the top of Google\u2019s search results.\n\nBut you can\u2019t just advertise for any keyword and expect it to lead to backlinks. Otherwise you\u2019d burn through your budget with little to show.\n\nSo the goal is to earn backlinks at a reasonable cost, whatever that might be to you. \n\nThe best way to do that is to bid on queries that have so-called \u201clink intent\u201d, meaning, the people searching for the query are actually looking for resources to link to. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn who these people are and how to find them in the tutorial.\n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:49 Find keywords that result in conversions\n3:43 Find pages that can benefit from optimizations\n06:10 Improve CTR on organic search results\n8:58 Get backlinks by advertising for queries with \u201clink intent\u201d\n\n#googleadsforseo #googleads #seo\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2020-12-16T13:30:11Z","tags":["google ads for seo","use google ads to improve seo","improve seo","seo","search engine optimization","seo tips","google ads","paid ads","ppc","paid media","pay per click advertising","advertising","online marketing","digital marketing"],"title":"How to use Google Ads to Improve SEO","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iZwr2mAmIxE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iZwr2mAmIxE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iZwr2mAmIxE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iZwr2mAmIxE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iZwr2mAmIxE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M7S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"155","dislikeCount":"22","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1588","viewCount":"49002"}},{"id":"8BdZ0dUu7VQ","snippet":{"description":"In this video, you\u2019ll learn how to do content writing for SEO that engages your audience, satisfies search engines, and drives consistent traffic.\nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Blogging and Content Marketing Resources\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ\n\nKeyword Research Tutorial: From Start to Finish \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OMJQPqG2Uas\n\nKeyword Research Tutorials for SEO \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2u5JCtiYWfvnSvAkoPwg5VY \n\nLink Building Tutorials (Step-By-Step) \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tjUTuAHpHidz5e2hAedP_m \n\nHow to Measure Keyword Difficulty and Rank on Google \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jSOq3ysvBk8 \n\nBlogging Tips for Beginners That Actually Work \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Ml4mQJjgX6g\n\nHow to Write a Blog Post That Actually Gets Traffic \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-kOT39l0omU\n\nWhat is Content Marketing and How to Crush It on a Tiny Budget \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4XrtVkhOBfQ\n***************************************\nWhether you\u2019re writing for your own site or for a client, you should have 2 objectives for your content. \n\n\u25ba The content should drive traffic to the site. \n\u25ba  The content should turn people into customers or push them further down the sales funnel. \n\nWith these objectives in mind, here\u2019s a simple process to achieve both of these goals. \n\nThe first step is to write about topics people are searching for.\n\nMost people like to write about topics that excite them. But these posts often have a short shelf life.\n\nWhen you create content around topics that people are searching for, then you get the opposite effect: free, passive and consistent traffic that usually grows over time. \n\nHow do you do this? This video will show you how.\n\nThe second step is to assess the type of content Google wants you to create.\n\nGoogle\u2019s job is to deliver the most relevant results for any given search query. And they do a pretty good job at this. \n\nSo naturally, if you want to rank for your target topic, then you need to know the type of content Google will rank for that query.\n\nThis is called search intent.  Watch the video to find out how to determine search intent from any query. \n\nStep three is to create a data-driven outline.\n\nContent is like a puzzle. There are a lot of different pieces and it\u2019s tough to assemble without some kind of framework. Outlines are like the edge pieces of the puzzle. They help to form the base and all you need to do is fill in the missing pieces. \n\nThey also help make sure you\u2019re including all critical points worth communicating on the topic.\n\nThis video will show you how to easily create a blog post outline.\n\nStep four is to create a click-worthy headline.\n\nA headline is important because it\u2019s what stands between you and a visitor. Its main job is to convince people to actually click on your result. Then it\u2019s your content\u2019s job to keep them reading. \n\nWatch the video to learn how to write good headlines.\n\nStep five is to write a killer intro using the AIDA formula.\n\nThe introduction is arguably the most important part of your content. Its job is to hook your reader, tell them they\u2019re in the right place, and convince them to keep reading. \n\nFortunately, there\u2019s a tried and tested formula you can use called AIDA, which you can use.\n\nWhat does it stand for and how do you use it? Watch the video. \n\nStep six is to make your content actionable and easy to digest.\n\nSo your outline should act as a nice skeleton for your post. And to add meat to those bones, you need to do two things.\n\n\u25ba Make your content as helpful as possible.\n\u25ba Make it easy to digest and read by focusing on your communication and writing skills.\n\nWatch the video to learn some tips on how to do this. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n1:11 Write about topics people are actually searching for\n3:50 Assess the \"type\" of content Google will rank\n5:18 Create a data-driven outline\n7:15 Create a click-worthy headline\n8:04 Write a killer intro using the AIDA formula\n9:47 Make your content actionable and easy to digest\n11:25 Get unfiltered feedback\n\n#contentwritingforseo #contentwriting #contentmarketing\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2021-01-06T13:30:00Z","tags":["content writing for seo","content writing","seo content","writing seo content","content writing tutorial for beginners","seo content writing","how to write seo content","rank on google","seo content strategy","create seo content","seo content marketing","seo content writing tutorial","how to write seo friendly article","seo blog post","what is seo content writing","content writing tutorial","how to write a blog post for beginners","how to write a blog post","seo","blogging"],"title":"Content Writing for SEO: How to Create Content that Ranks in Google","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8BdZ0dUu7VQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8BdZ0dUu7VQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8BdZ0dUu7VQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8BdZ0dUu7VQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8BdZ0dUu7VQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M26S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"203","dislikeCount":"20","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2053","viewCount":"44439"}},{"id":"bG-AL2Hd6Cc","snippet":{"description":"In today\u2019s video, you\u2019ll learn how to start a career in digital marketing and grow both your knowledge and salary. \nSubscribe \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\n\n***************************************\nAdditional Digital Marketing Resources\n\nSEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Ranking \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvwS7cV9GmQ \n\nDigital Marketing for Beginners: 7 Strategies That Work \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wZZnxXyES80 \n\nBlogging for Business Course \u25ba  https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tbI3mYhAO8oZ2NYMrJuNPq \n\nA Simple 7\u2011Step SEO Tutorial for Beginners \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-tutorial\/ \n\n***************************************\nHere are the stages you might go through in your path to become a professional digital marketer. \n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll want to do is to create your own website or blog. \n\nCreating your own website gives you your own testing grounds. It lets you get practical experience with marketing strategies without worrying about hurting someone else\u2019s site.\n\nJust choose a niche that you\u2019re interested in and create a site using WordPress. The important part is that you invest a bit of money into your own website because you\u2019re less likely to give up without giving it a fair shot. \n\nNext, focus on one area of digital marketing. \n\nWhat online marketing strategies are available and which one should you choose? You\u2019ll learn more in the video. \n\nThe next thing you need to do is spend some time learning about the area of internet marketing you want to pursue. \n\nThe best place to start is by reading or watching a beginner\u2019s guide on the topic from a reputable person or company. Beginner\u2019s guides will help you get a general overview of the marketing method and also act as a \u201chub\u201d for subtopics to research after. \n\nThe next step is to actually execute on the things you learn. \n\nConsuming too much content will lead to analysis paralysis, where you end up over-analyzing things and getting nothing done. \n\nWhat should you do instead? Watch the video to learn more. \n\nFinally, get acquainted with some free digital marketing tools.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out, it\u2019s tough to pay for premium marketing tools. But there are some free ones that you should get acquainted with.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn what these tools are in the video. \n\nThe next stage is to get a job or internship at a digital marketing agency. \n\nWorking at an agency is a great way to learn digital marketing fast because you\u2019ll have the opportunity to work with people who are ahead of you in your career. It\u2019s also a place you can find mentors and you\u2019ll also get a ton of hands-on experience working on various types of client sites. \n\nNext, consider freelancing. Freelancing is a great way to get more hands-on experience while increasing your income. \n\nWhy is freelancing great? You\u2019ll find out in the video. \n\nAfter you\u2019ve built up a portfolio and somewhat of a positive reputation in your industry, you can consider going full-time into consulting.\n\nThe keyword here is \u201cconsider.\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with staying in your job, working your way up, and retiring. Not everyone is meant to be a consultant and to be frank, not everyone should be. \n\nSo, no matter where you are in your career, it\u2019s not too late to start in digital marketing. And just like any other career, it takes time to learn and grow. \n\nTimestamps:\n\n0:58 Create your own website or blog\n2:53 Learn about the area you want to pursue\n3:36 Execute on the things you learn\n4:14 Study up some free digital marketing tools\n5:45 Get a job or internship at a digital marketing agency\n6:55 Consider freelancing\n\n#startacareerindigitalmarketing #growyourcareerindigitalmarketing #digitalmarketing\n\nBe sure to subscribe for more actionable marketing and SEO tutorials.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\n\r\nSTAY TUNED:\r\nAhrefs \u25ba https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/\r\nYouTube \u25ba https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/AhrefsCom?sub_confirmation=1\r\nFacebook \u25bahttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Ahrefs\r\nTwitter \u25bahttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ahrefs","publishedAt":"2021-01-20T13:30:03Z","tags":["how to start a career in digital marketing","digital marketing career","how to become a digital marketer","get a job in digital marketing","how to get a job in digital marketing with no experience digital marketing careers","how to get a job in marketing","digital marketing internship","learn digital marketing","how to become a digital marketing expert","digital marketing career path","how to learn digital marketing","digital marketing","how to get a job with no experience","start a website"],"title":"How to Start a Career in Digital Marketing (Step-by-Step)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bG-AL2Hd6Cc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bG-AL2Hd6Cc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bG-AL2Hd6Cc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bG-AL2Hd6Cc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bG-AL2Hd6Cc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"133","dislikeCount":"6","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1514","viewCount":"24599"}}]

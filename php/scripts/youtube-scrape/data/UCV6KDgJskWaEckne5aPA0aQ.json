Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nWhen I got my real estate license at 18 years old, I knew NO ONE looking to buy or sell. My family wasn't in real estate, they weren't giving me business, so I had to do what works:\n\n1. Letting everyone know you're in real estate and that you're there to help\n\n2. Doing open houses every single Sunday to meet potential buyers and sellers. The more face-time you can get in front of new people, the better. Follow up with your open house contacts. \n\n3. Cold calling and door knocking . Disclosure: I've done this in the past and stopped. I personally didn't see results from it. It's not something I enjoyed doing. But I'm including it regardless because it's still a viable option that many people use. This also includes targeting FSBO, expired listings, mailers, etc. - it works, there are ways to be successful, but I personally don't use them. \n\n4. Zillow, Trulia, Redfin, Craigslist, WestSideRentals.com - I'm NOT talking about paying to advertise on these sites. I don't do any paid marketing. Paid marketing can work, I've done it in the past, but I'm referring to submitting your listing on the sites and getting calls from it. Sometimes it automatically populates from when a property is listed on the MLS, but if you have the authorization to advertise a property that's not yet listed, you can upload it manually and get calls.\n\n5. Craigslist. This is the foundation of my entire success in real estate. I started with doing leasing on Craigslist which blossomed into $15,000,000-$20,000,000+ per year in sales after a few years. I'd meet lease clients on craigslist, help them find a home to rent, and they would refer me other clients, would want to buy something themselves, and they would become repeat clients. Craigslist took me nearly 4 years to begin seeing significant monetary results, so it's NOT a \"get rich quick\" tactic. But it's a great way to meet prospective future buyers in an area that not many agents are doing. \n\n6. From the first 5, you'll begin to see repeat and referral business. This grows over time and after a few years, this type of business will become more prolific - if you're doing a good job.\n\n7. There's an abundance of material to learn just about anything you want to. However, the unfortunate truth is that very few people will actually apply what they learn - it's great to listen to in theory, but without action and consistency this means nothing. So I recommend applying some of these and see what works for you. \n\nThanks again for watching! Does anyone actually read this? If so, what are the chances someone would read this all the way through AND make it to me questioning if someone is actually reading this?

So I pinned his comment at the top of the video and challenged him to upload a video, in public, and upload it to YouTube within 7 days. Since he delivered as promised, I\u2019m making a video addressing him as an example of someone who did what they were afraid of because it doesn\u2019t fucking matter. \n\nSo in my response to him, I did the same. I\u2019m absolutely petrified of filming in public in front of people...so I did this video while walking down the Hollywood Blvd Walk of Fame to show everyone how to say \"fuck it\" and just do whatever they're afraid of. It's really not as bad as you think. I was seriously scared AF doing this\u2026this was my first \u201creal\u201d time filming with people around. I even started making excuses before doing this about \u201chow I wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d But I did it anyway. And guess what, no one cares. No one notices. No one thinks of you. You can do whatever you want in life and never have to worry about being embarrassed because NO ONE CARES. \n\nThe whole point  of this is that you should do that thing you\u2019ve been putting off because you\u2019ve been too nervous. Whether it be that business you\u2019re wanting to start, the opportunity you\u2019ve yet to take, or something as small as a video you wanted to upload to YouTube. Just do it.

In fact, part of my inspiration to upload my first video stemmed from watching someone else\u2019s video on YouTube. Every one of the videos is a giant sales pitch to buy a program and coaching. Someone commented and asked a really good, genuine question. His response was like \u201cSounds like you\u2019d really benefit from my program, please sign up in the link in my description.\u201d That shit pisses me off.

What tips can you give me? What suggestions can you give me?\u201d It\u2019s so generic that I have a hard time answering them because, I mean, how am I actually supposed to answer that? To any of you watching this who have asked me this - THANK YOU for asking, because you\u2019ve inspired this video. \n\nBecause I hate clickbait bullshit, here are my suggestions:\n\n1. Save as much money as you can. In my opinion, it doesn\u2019t really matter how much you make, it\u2019s how much you save and invest. The guy saving $50,000 per year on a $100,000 income can be much, much wealthier than the guy making $500,000 and spending $500,000. Don\u2019t spend money on useless crap, either. Often it\u2019s the small things that add up - those $8 beers, those $5 Starbucks drinks, the monthly porn subscriptions\u2026it gets expensive ;) Live frugally, save while you can, and invest. It\u2019ll put you in a very financially comfortable spot and when you hit a certain point, you\u2019ll start doing things because YOU want to do them\u2026not because you need the money. \n\n2. When you\u2019re first starting out in business, WORK WITH EVERYONE. You can\u2019t afford to be selective or picky with your clients. Even the really bad, nasty clients are the best to work with in the beginning - this is the best training you\u2019ll ever receive. You need to learn to deal with everyone. Patience is your friend. \n\n3. Surround yourself with people who are better than you. During the day, I\u2019m probably one of the least accomplished people I\u2019m around. Seriously. I\u2019m around people making MILLIONS of dollars per year\u2026my clients are buying $2,000,000-$7,000,000 houses. You think I\u2019m on their level? Hell nah\u2026well, not yet ;) But seriously, compared to them I\u2019m a chump. I learn from them, see what works, and incorporate that into my own style. \n\n4. Don\u2019t let people get to you, don\u2019t let them discourage you. People will always want to give their thoughts, play victim, tell you how hard something is\u2026usually it\u2019s not coming from a healthy mindset. Realize this and move on. \n\n5. Be open to criticism though. I REALLY value the people who give me honest advice, even if they dislike what I\u2019m doing. I take it to heart and see if I can make changes to better myself and what I\u2019m doing. Sometimes it\u2019s a difference of personal preference and that\u2019s totally cool, and sometimes it\u2019s on me to make a change for the better. Sometimes you can learn a thing or two. \n\n6. Trust yourself! Don\u2019t second guess yourself. I do it too much\u2026I\u2019ve had things I\u2019ve wanted to do, but haven\u2019t, and later looked back and thought \u201cI should\u2019ve done that.\u201d So if you have an intuition telling you something, DO IT. But if something sounds too good to be true, trust that instinct as well.\n\n7. Always be expanding, growing, and bettering yourself. Improve slightly each day, just a little more than the day before. The concept is that if you keep doing a little better each day, you\u2019ll start growing exponentially as a person. \n\n8. Do the above CONSISTENTLY. It\u2019s not about doing this for a week and thinking you\u2019re the next Elon Musk. Nah. Do it every single day\u2026for the rest of your life. It\u2019s about growing yourself as a person.\n\n9. Please pass it on and help others. I started this channel purely as a hobby because I thought it would be fun to make videos about real estate and finance, and share my thoughts and perspectives. It\u2019s been an eye-opening experience to be able to have the outreach I now have, so I intend to take full advantage to share what\u2019s worked for me and what I\u2019ve learned along the way. I don\u2019t need the money. I\u2019m not doing this for money. I\u2019m not selling anything. I don\u2019t do one-on-one coaching. I\u2019m not looking to mentor anyone individually. I don\u2019t need an assistant. I don\u2019t want you to split your deals 50\/50 with me for my advice. I don\u2019t want your investments, stakes of equity in your companies, or anything like that. I just enjoy making videos and replying to your hundreds of comments, as weird as that sounds. It\u2019s been one of the most amazing experiences to see how much I\u2019ve been able to inspire other people. I do this out of passion, as I think you\u2019ll see by how much time i spend responding to you guys (there will be a time when I won\u2019t be able to do that, though, depending how big this gets\u2026)\n\n10.

That\u2019s adjusted for inflation, so that money will have the same buying power in the future as it does right now. This isn\u2019t a get rich quick scheme, it\u2019s just about the importance of investing as much as you can, as early as you can, for as long as you can. Think of every purchase in its future value - that $5 coffee is worth $50 in future money. That $80 dinner is worth $800 in future money. When you think of things this way, you begin to question if certain purchases are really worth it to you right now, and helps you focus your money on the things that will really bring you the most enjoyment vs a large payout in the future.\n\nI don't recommend trying to time the market, either - you know, waiting around for the market to crash - or not buying because \"the market is at an all time high.\" Or trying to sell at the top. I mean, dude, the market is always at an all time high throughout history. Just invest consistently over a long period of time and you\u2019ll be fine. \n\nCompounded interest is an amazing concept. But it's takes discipline and consistency. People want an easy quick fix. This is neither. It takes discipline not to spend your money for 30+ years. It also takes time to see your returns add up. But over time, the returns are massive.\n\nNow I know some of you will say YOLO, you're only young once, live today you can die tomorrow - true. There is a lot of benefit in living your life now and not being some 70 year old with trillions of dollars because you didn't spend anything, yet don't have the capacity to enjoy it anymore because of illness or because you're just 70 years old. Just don't be stupid about it and spend all your money on things that don't add real, lasting value and happiness to your life. \n\nAnd because people want an answer to what I specifically do, here it is: I invest everything in VFIAX. Every year. I automatically reinvest the dividends. Then I use the majority of my money to invest in real estate. Rinse. Repeat. Cash flow. Make YouTube videos.

THREE FUCKING YEARS. I wasted years of my life being afraid of making a video and uploading it to YouTube for some really stupid reasons. But I finally did. And because I did, here you are reading this (hopefully). \n\nDeep down, I was afraid I wasn\u2019t good enough for YouTube\u2026I was terrified I\u2019d upload something, have someone I know see it, and I\u2019d just embarrass myself and look like an idiot. Or worse, some random internet stranger would give it a DISLIKE! OMG! ANYTHING BUT THAT! It\u2019s totally irrational, but deep down I just didn\u2019t think I was good enough to make YouTube videos and I rationalized it in so many ways - I didn\u2019t have the Lamborghini, the professional camera, the equipment, the content\u2026whatever, I didn\u2019t have it. \n\nThen I had a \u201cFuck it\u201d moment and uploaded a video. Here I am now, 2.5 months later\u2026you\u2019re watching this. That\u2019s crazy that a single video could spark so much of an outreach and inspire people. And that made me realize, if I was too scared to do something, how many OTHER PEOPLE are out there just putting off the things they really should be doing? Something that\u2019ll make a positive impact on people? Ahhh hell nah, that\u2019s not gonna happen. \n\nHere\u2019s my thoughts of why we\u2019re afraid to take risks, to put ourselves out there, and why you should just ignore your brain sometimes. Except if you do something stupid. Don\u2019t do anything stupid. But you get the idea. Enjoy! \n\nPS. I guess my language was a little heavy in this...I say Fuck and Shit more times than I intended without thinking about it. You guys give a fucking shit about swearing or nah? Comment and let me know if it's too much. I potentially may tone it down, but when I make these spur-of-the-moment, I have to consciously think about filtering myself.

The tenant ended up growing \"substances\" in large-scale qualities in the garage, stopped paying rent, and then vandalized the house before he was evicted. Do your due diligence when signing a tenant. \n\nMistake #3: Not having a social life when I was younger\nMaking friends and keeping friends is work, and it\u2019s worth it to put the time in to keep in touch.

It\u2019s not money and fancy things (although a Lotus helps, a little). But seriously, from my experience, it\u2019s the the adventures you have along the way that brings the most enjoyment and fulfillment in life. It\u2019s the doing and not the receiving. It\u2019s the memories and experiences and not the things. This is how to be happy. \n\nBuying things is cool, and it\u2019s nice - but it\u2019s just a quick \u201cfix\u201d rather than a lasting solution. Inevitably, we all build up a tolerance to things and outer stimuli that creates our new baseline of what we need to be happy again. Much like a drug, we continue needing more to get the same level of excitement as we once did. Understanding this helps put things into perspective that there will never be enough, there will always be more, and chasing the dragon won\u2019t lead to future happiness. With this in mind, enjoy the moment - be grateful - and have fun with the process. \n\n\/rant\n\nAdd me on Instagram: GPStephan\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-04-20T22:29:32Z","tags":["how to be happy","how to be happy and positive all the time","how to be happy with yourself","how to be happy in life","how to be happy again","the truth about happiness","how to be fulfilled","how to be fulfilled in life","how to be fulfilled in business","gabriel conte","improvement pill","brendon.com","actualized.org","the secret to happiness"],"title":"Rant: The TRUTH about happiness","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SUQ3hwyYKxM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SUQ3hwyYKxM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SUQ3hwyYKxM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SUQ3hwyYKxM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SUQ3hwyYKxM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT3M9S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"251","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1012","viewCount":"17999"}},{"id":"hsi21xfEdGw","snippet":{"description":"It doesn\u2019t matter what business you\u2019re in, standing out is essential to getting noticed. Whether you\u2019re starting a business, launching a product, or making a YouTube channel - it\u2019s easy to fall through the cracks and go unnoticed when there are SO MANY PEOPLE competing for the same thing. Here are my recommendations to stand out to beat the competition:\n\n1. Be memorable. You can do this by improving on what other people are doing and ADDING MORE VALUE. \n2. Do it better - offer some incentive for people to go to YOU vs someone else. \n3. Do not half-ass it. When you\u2019re competing with someone else, another product, or another business - you gotta kill it. \n4. Put your own personality and spin in it. This is the hardest thing for people to copy, should they chose to take your ideas.\n5. Take risks. If you do the opposite of what most people do, your chances of succeeding are higher because there's less competition!\n6. Do above the bare minimum. Go all out. \n7. Try to stay ahead of the curve. When you spot a new trend, take advantage of it. \n8.

This comes as firsthand experience of my own investing strategies, both from what I\u2019ve learned as a landlord of multiple rental-properties and as a high-end Realtor. \n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nSince clickbait sucks\u2026here\u2019s the entire video summed up:\n\n1:00 - Loan options. I generally recommend a residential loan and sticking with 1-4 units. After 4 units, the loan is considered commercial and carries a higher interest rate, higher down payment, and more qualifying restrictions.\n\n2:12 - Single family residence vs multi family building. I generally prefer multi-family residences, but be wary of future rent control restrictions depending on your location and city regulations. I also explain how to live for free - live in one of the units and rent out the others. Generally this will cover almost all of your costs. Free housing!\n\n4:40 - Conventional vs FHA loan. I prefer a conventional loan over FHA, as convention loans have lower fees, lower interest rates, and generally offer better terms than an FHA loan. FHA loans could work depending on your situation, but it ultimately comes down to the term and interest rate of the loan.\n\n6:53 - How I search for properties. Everything I find is through the multiple listing service (MLS). I personally like to see everything as soon as it comes on the market, but I also look at properties that have been on the market awhile as they might be more flexible in price.\n\n10:55 - What times of homes I look for. I personally go for homes that just need cosmetic remodeling. Kitchens, bathrooms, floors, landscape, and paint are very easy to do and doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to do. It also adds a lot of instant value by remodeling these areas - plus, many buyers overlook homes that need minor remodeling.\n\n12:57 - What areas I invest in. I invest in areas that are surrounding other high-priced areas, since development generally moves outwards with time. I do my best to predict the next \u201cboom\u201d areas where development and business money is moving in.\n\n15:15 - How i calculate if a home is a good investment. I like a mix of cash on cash return and appreciation. In addition to this, I like a home where I can add value through cosmetic remodeling. This way I make an immediate return on equity, I can make some passive income from rent, and future appreciation on the home\u2019s value.\n\n20:30 - What area I like to buy in. I make sure the home isn\u2019t on the same block as an apartment building, a business, a busy street, or a street with speed bumps.\n\n21:40 - How to calculate your rents. I like to use craigslist to compare what other units are renting for. \n\n22:30 - Out of state investments. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t do it. \n\n23:11 - Is a property manager worth it? Sometimes - I don\u2019t really use one, but I would in the future. \n\n24:50 - BUILD YOUR CREDIT SCORE. This is so important. \n\nAdd me on Instagram: GPStephan\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nSuggested reading: \nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-04-10T21:26:40Z","tags":["investing in real estate","investing in real estate for beginners","investing in real estate rentals","how to invest in real estate","investing in real estate for dummies","investing in real estate 2017","how to invest in real estate tai lopez","tai lopez","how to buy rental property","how to buy rental property with no money down","how to buy rental property cash","how to buy real estate","buying rental properties","how to buy a house"],"title":"Discussion: How to invest in Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MU0cDHSBlRw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MU0cDHSBlRw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MU0cDHSBlRw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MU0cDHSBlRw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MU0cDHSBlRw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT27M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"442","dislikeCount":"16","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2129","viewCount":"57748"}},{"id":"m6tSUsB12QM","snippet":{"description":"House hack: Forget having to make a rent payment or come out of pocket for a mortgage every month. This is exactly how you can essentially live for free by investing in multifamily real estate as a primary residence. Plus - if do it right, you can literally GET PAID to live for free. Here's how. \n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nWhen you already have some savings and want to make the jump to becoming a home owner, one thing most people overlook is multi-family properties. These include duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes. What makes this unique is that in addition to your unit, you have other units that you can freely rent out which can cover your entire ownership cost of the property. When you buy these properties correctly, your rental income from the other units will cover your entire mortgage, property taxes, insurance and repairs, essentially letting you live in one of the units for free. Not only that, but you can apply the rental income towards your loan, meaning you can often qualify for a much larger loan than normal. You\u2019re also paying down your loan and building equity at the same time.\n\nMy biggest recommendation to maximize the rental income is to look for vacant multi-family buildings that need cosmetic upgrades. This means you can immediately begin updating the property when you buy it - new floors, paint, bathrooms, landscaping are all cheap and make a significant improvement for rental income. \n\nNow of course, there are downsides of doing this. First of all, you will have to manage tenants and that can be a part time job in and of itself. You will also have some shared common areas - it\u2019s not any worse than an apartment, but you will be in close proximity with your tenants. It\u2019s not for everyone. \n\nBut the good news is that when you\u2019re ready to buy a house or upgrade, you can rent out your unit and you have a great cash-flowing rental property for you to keep long term. Essentially when this is paid off, it could be your retirement money that keeps cash flowing month after month. Or, you can live there long term and bank as much money as you can knowing that you don\u2019t have be out of pocket every month for housing payments. \n\nAdd me on Instagram: GPStephan\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-04-24T22:50:35Z","tags":["how to live for free","house hack","house to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","multifamily investing","how to invest in multifamily property","tai lopez","grant cardone","passive income","real estate investing","investing in multifamily properties","investing in multifamily homes","investing in multi family real estate","real estate","how to buy real estate"],"title":"House Hack: How to live FOR FREE by investing in multifamily real estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/m6tSUsB12QM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/m6tSUsB12QM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/m6tSUsB12QM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/m6tSUsB12QM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/m6tSUsB12QM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M11S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1834","dislikeCount":"565","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16731","viewCount":"522860"}},{"id":"9DipJvqwUpc","snippet":{"description":"This is a follow-up to my video \u201cHow to find a mentor - the RIGHT way.\u201d I explain EXACTLY how I met each person in my life who became a mentor and EXACTLY what was involved.

I never intended to work with him.\n\nIn ALL the scenarios above, there\u2019s one common theme: I never intended for it to happen, it just happened.

Don\u2019t just ask \u201cWill you be my mentor\u201d or \u201cWill you mentor me?\u201d\n2. Don\u2019t approach it having done no research about what you want to do\n3. Don\u2019t ask vague questions\n\nWhat you SHOULD do:\n\n1. Already be doing and learning what you want to do and achieve - ON YOUR OWN\n2. Do NOT let NOT having a mentor stop you from doing this\n3. Be specific and have a basic background about what you want to do\n4. Be open to ask for help, but if this is something you can learn from a 10 second google search\u2026that\u2019s bad\n5. OPINIONS and EXPERIENCE are a mentor\u2019s strong point, not necessarily factual knowledge  \n6. Offer something in return - doesn\u2019t need to be monetary. Your time, your enthusiasm, your help..whatever you can give.\n\nI\u2019ve never asked anybody I consider a mentor, \u201cWill you mentor me?\u201d It\u2019s something that happened naturally over time. Asking \u201cWill you mentor me? is a yes or no question and IF it\u2019s a yes, it\u2019s a HUGE obligation for that person. Very doubtful they\u2019ll just say \u201cyes\u201d right off the bat. \n\nI\u2019ve never approached anyone specifically - even with my mentors in real estate, it all happened organically. I hope the same comes to all of you watching. \n\nThere are also a multitude of forums, websites, and videos for you to learn from on your own. Chances are if you\u2019re interested in something, so are a million other people - use the internet to reach out and learn from as many people as you can and do what you want to do - mentor or no mentor.  \n\nA mentor can be a great source of encouragement, knowledge, and wisdom. However, do what you want, regardless if you have someone coaching you or not, and eventually the right people tend to come along once they see how dedicated you are to whatever you do.

It\u2019s everywhere. I\u2019m being hit up about Bitcoin dozens of times per day. People get so opinionated about this topic and usually people either LOVE it or HATE it. I personally don\u2019t have an opinion either way, but I\u2019ll throw in my unbiased thoughts out there if I think this is a good INVESTMENT or not.  \n\nIf you don\u2019t already know, Bitcoin is a crypto currency released in 2009. Bitcoin\u2019s are earned from computer mining systems that runs through complex algorithms \nand once a specific string of code is deciphered, the system rewards you with bitcoin. The value of Bitcoin partially comes from the fact that there\u2019s a finite amount of Bitcoin that can be mined - 21,000,000, specifically. This is similar to the US dollar on the gold standard, where only a finite amount of gold exists.\n\nThe value of bitcoin tends to increase as it gets more time consuming and more difficult to mine - the more bitcoins in existence, the harder the algorithms are for the computer to solve, driving up the cost to mine more bitcoin. \n\nBut does bitcoin have value?\n\nYes and no. It has a basic value because people spend a lot of time and money mining bitcoins. If people invest their own resources for bitcoin, they want a return on investment. This implies SOME value. There\u2019s also some value in what people will exchange for bitcoin - obviously if 10 bitcoins can be exchanged for a Honda Civic, that implies some type of value. Since there\u2019s a limited number of bitcoins to be mined, the scarcity also drives some perceived value. \n\nThis isn\u2019t much different than the US dollar, really, where we give $1 the value of $1\u2026except this $1 is subject to government manipulation, inflation, and regulation. While it\u2019s no longer backed by gold, it\u2019s backed by our entire economy, what it produces, and the dollar\u2019s perceived value in relation to other items.\n\nNow the US dollar's value is still tied to the US economy, our laws, and our government (for better of worse, lol). The US dollar doesn't have its entire value because we as people give it value - it has a very strong foundation of an income-and-product producing nation behind it. Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't really produce anything - its value is merely on what we, the people, associate it with, and the benefits of having a decentralized currency without regulation. There is no longstanding country behind it, it doesn't supply anything, and it doesn't produce anything. This is my main emphasis between Bitcoin and the US dollar. \n\nHowever, Bitcoin also has it\u2019s advantages - it\u2019s not subject to government control and manipulation and it\u2019s entirely decentralized. It\u2019s totally anonymous. Never have to pay foreign exchange fees. HOWEVER, there are no refunds. There is no regulation is something happens or if someone steals your coins\u2026.oh yeah, and these insanely wild price increases we\u2019ve all seen. \n\nBut is it a good investment? My concern is that, until usage starts driving the value more than self-perpetuated speculation, I'd have a hard time seeing it as an investment. Investing in a relatively new currency is a very high risk, high reward strategy - you could get a huge payout or the values could drop 50% in a week. The volatility of the currency makes it extremely risky. Long term, I think Bitcoin will be around for the foreseeable future - but I would not be replacing a normal long term investment strategy with Bitcoin, at least not this early on. In fact, going slightly off topic here, my prediction is that bitcoin will eventually follow very closely alongside gold and precious metals. During political turmoil and global uncertainty, people will see a safe haven in cryptocurrencies. But this is a long, long time away, if ever. \n\nIf you want to invest, invest only what you can afford to lose. But I wouldn\u2019t call this an investment\u2026I\u2019d call this highly risky cryptocurrency speculation where you could turn $100 into $75 million, but likely have a higher chance turning $100 into significantly less. \n\nAdd me on Instagram: GPStephan\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan","publishedAt":"2017-05-24T22:01:59Z","tags":["how does bitcoin work","is bitcoin a good investment","can you invest in bitcoin","how do you invest in bitcoin","bitcoin investment","bitcoin","is bitcoin mining worth it","is bitcoin legal","is bitcoin safe","is bitcoin the future","is bitcoin mining legal","bitcoin mining","bitcoin explained","bitcoin for dummies","investing strategies bitcoin","investment strategies","bitcoin investments 2017","bitcoin investors","investment strategy 2017"],"title":"From $100 to $75 Million: Is Bitcoin a good investment?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1wYq-UNPccY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1wYq-UNPccY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1wYq-UNPccY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1wYq-UNPccY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1wYq-UNPccY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"612","dislikeCount":"78","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1354","viewCount":"96057"}},{"id":"W5jyH4j_Yps","snippet":{"description":"As a full time real estate agent since 2008, this is the most common question I get asked - so this is my video addressing anyone interested in getting into the real estate sales industry. It\u2019s been the funnest \u201cjob\u201d I\u2019ve ever had and I couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything other than working as a Realtor and investing in my own properties on the side. Feel free to add me on Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nBenefits of becoming a Realtor:\n-You don\u2019t need a college degree\n-You make your own hours\n-You don\u2019t have to be in an office all day\n-You can wear what you want, for the most part\n-You can directly control your income\n-You can meet people you\u2019d never ordinarily meet\n-You get to see some crazy cool homes\n-You can represent yourself when you buy\/sell your own properties\n-You get great tax advantages and tax deductions\n\nOn the downside:\n-Many people fail\n-Many people never make money\n-Your income can be very sporadic (high highs, low lows)\n-The hours can be odd\/inconsistent\n-Not everyone can handle working with people and multiple personalities \n\nYou don\u2019t need any prior knowledge in the real estate industry, although you will need to learn a significant amount as you go along.\nIt also doesn\u2019t take a ton of money to get started - as long as you have some savings to cover yourself until you start earning consistent money, which could be 6-12 months from when you start, the fees are manageable. The cost of actually becoming licensed could be as little as a few hundred dollars. \nIt\u2019s also a great career to start when you\u2019re young - since you have very little overhead, it\u2019s a great time to begin learning and honing your skills. By the time your older, you\u2019ll already have established yourself in the industry. \n\nFirst step is getting your real estate license. The requirements vary from state-to-state, so google \u201cHow to get your real estate license in (your state here).\u201d \nYou\u2019ll usually need to enroll in a real estate course which is generally about 135-hours of education. You can take it online (what I recommend) or in person. \nIf you\u2019re in California, I took my real estate license course from PremierSchools: https:\/\/goo.gl\/IDVxCf (use code grstp for 5% off). www.AlliedSchools.com is also another great option, as is Kaplan for most other states in the US. \n\nOnce you pass these courses, you\u2019ll sign up to take your state test. This is what you\u2019ll need to study for - generally there are plenty of exam cram products you can buy, many of which are helpful. \n\nPassing your tests and getting your license is easy. Really, really easy - the barrier to entry is very, very low. Actually making money is another story. Once you get your license, my BIGGEST recommendation is to work as an assistant to another Realtor. This will give you all the experience you need with very little risk, since you\u2019re getting paid for your time. When you feel comfortable enough, you can go off on your own and begin working your own clients. Even if you have to intern for free to see if you like it, it\u2019s worth it for the experience. \n\nIf you decide to go off on your own, you\u2019ll need to join a real estate brokerage as a new agent who will oversee your salesperson activity. My recommendation is to first find a brokerage that works in the area that you want to work in. If you want to work in the high end luxury market, find brokerages that work in the area you want to be in. Make sure that brokerage also offers training and support - this is crucial as a new agent who\u2019s still learning. \n\nA good book I recommend is \u201cthe millionaire real estate agent\u201d by Gary Keller. This pretty much covers everything you\u2019d need to know!

Now keep in mind these are just my thoughts and theories - while the exact YouTube algorithm is kept confidential and no one really knows what\u2019s up, I\u2019ll share what I\u2019ve done and what I think works best to get your video pushed and get you a ton of activity to your channel.\n\nTo get this out of the way, one of the most important small things to do is allow monetization. From what I\u2019ve seen, YouTube is aimed towards doing what makes it the most money - by allowing monetization on YouTube, you allow YouTube to have a financial interest in your video succeeding. This will likely heighten the chances of your video being promoted and pushed by YouTube because they make money off of it. So if you have a channel, turn on monetization.\n\nIf you\u2019re first starting out, these are the most important things you can do to increase the engagement of your videos and increase the likelihood your video will begin showing up in search results, and subsequently pushed, is to start with this:\n\n1. Good Content. Content is everything. My first video, which now has over 300,000 views, was pretty poor quality. It was the first video I ever recorded of myself, on my iPhone. I essentially just talked to my phone for 20 minutes. BUT, the content was good - and that\u2019s why people watched. \n2. SEO is really, really important. When you start out, you need to get people to find you - this is where SEO comes in. Make titles that people frequently search for and keep your titles as specific as possible. \n3. With the above, your title, description, and tags should ALL MATCH UP. I spent a lot of time on my description, writing as much as I can, hoping that certain terms or phrases will be picked up by analytics. It worked. Most of my videos rank on searches within the first page of specific terms. \n4. Upload OFTEN. YouTube favors creators that upload frequently and regularly. \n5.  Engagement is key - the more people comment, like, share, and subscribe, the more YouTube sees your video as being desirable, and the more likely they are to recommend it.\n6. Use good, custom thumbnails. Seriously, a thumbnail makes a huge difference on getting people to click on your video.\n7. Social proof is real. The more subscribers you have, the more likely people are going to be to subscribe to you. Plus people see you have a history of regular uploads after a certain amount of time.\n\nAs a new YouTuber, these methods above help you get started - but it doesn\u2019t give you the big views. This is where YouTube\u2019s algorithm gets REALLY interesting. Out of the 400,000+ views I\u2019ve received this month, less than 10,000 views came from search results. The vast majority came from recommended and suggested videos - this is where you want to end up.  From what I've seen, the larger you get, the less important SEO become. YouTube changed up their algorithms to favor videos with higher watch times, higher retention rate, and higher engagement rather than the number of views or how searchable your videos are. Instead of promoting short videos that people will watch all the way through from search results, YouTube likes to promote longer videos with a higher watch time and higher engagement. It's less about coming up with searchable titles\/topics than it is about making good, engaging content, and hoping that YouTube decides to push it out to viewers.\n\nYouTube sees how many people like, comment, share, and subscribe per view you get - the higher the ratio of engagement to views, the more likely it is that your content is good and the more likely it is to be promoted by YouTube because they make money off good content that keeps people watching YouTube. It seems like most YouTubers aim to be in the 11-18 minute mark - I\u2019m not sure if this is on purpose, but it seems to be just the right amount of time for people to watch without losing interest super quickly. \n\nWhile I can pretend to know what works and what doesn\u2019t, in the end no one really knows and these are purely just speculations about what happens. These are totally just my theories from what I\u2019ve experienced, and I figured I\u2019d share them with everyone interested.\n\nAdd me on Instagram: GPStephan\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-05-19T21:30:48Z","tags":["how to grow a youtube channel","youtube algorithm hack","youtube algorithm revealed","how to grow a youtube channel fast","how to grow a youtube channel with 0 views 0 subscribers","how to gain a following on youtube","how to get fans on youtube","how to start a youtube channel","youtube algorithm","youtube algorithm 2017","youtube algorithm exposed","what is the youtube algorithm","youtube algorithm change","youtube algorithm update","youtube algorithm explain"],"title":"How to grow a YouTube Channel in 2017: YouTube Algorithm Revealed??","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/auY91T4yZks\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/auY91T4yZks\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/auY91T4yZks\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/auY91T4yZks\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/auY91T4yZks\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4886","dislikeCount":"232","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7317","viewCount":"101493"}},{"id":"F7ddEfRBx4k","snippet":{"description":"The Sunset Plaza GT is the BEST car meet right now in Los Angeles\u2026this is like the Disneyland of rare exotics in the middle of West Hollywood.

Over 90% of my business has, in some form or other, originated from Craigslist - either by meeting someone who\u2019s directly called me from the site, or referred to me by someone I\u2019ve met from Craigslist. This quickly turned into a six-figure per year income from continuous Craigslist leads and referral business. Here\u2019s how I did it. \n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nNote: Craigslist is primarily US-based. There may be similar sites that work best with your country (Kijiji in Canada, for instance).\n\nDisclosure: Craigslist alone won\u2019t make you millions. This took me years to cultivate - it took me several years to build it up to the point where I was actually making over $100,000 just from craigslist leads and referrals from craigslist leads. It won\u2019t be a get-rich-quick technique but it CAN add tremendous value to what you\u2019re already doing. \n\n1. Go to Craigslist (I KNOW someone will ask me this\u2026so here it is\u2026step one\u2026Craigslist.com)\n\n2. When posting, I\u2019ve found longer titles work better than shorter titles  - ALL CAPS work best. If you use symbols like stars  \u2605 or brackets, shorter titles do better. Use this carefully as it can be a bit spammy. \n\n3. The body of the message should be kept simple, clear and concise. First thing to mention is your name and contact information (email and phone)\n\n4. Mention that you have access to other properties and that they should contact you (if you\u2019re a Realtor and want to work with leads)\n\n5. Mention the specifics of the house - bedrooms, bathrooms, price, and square footage. \n\n6. Describe the house in extreme details. The more keywords you use in your description, the more it\u2019ll come up on Craigslist search results.\n\n7. If you\u2019re a Realtor - DISCLOSE that you\u2019re a Realtor.\n\n8. MAKE SURE TO HAVE GOOD PICTURES. This is essential.\n\n9. Make sure to pick up your phone and return emails as soon as they come in. Otherwise you can lose the client. \n\n10. Do not renew your ads. Just continue posting new ads and letting the old ones continue to run. \n\n11. Ideally have several ads going at the same time, this increases the likelihood of someone reaching out. \n\nThat\u2019s it! It\u2019s pretty simple. Do this regularly, continue adding new lease listings when the current ones get rented out, continue helping people with their rentals, and these clients will eventually turn into buyers, sellers, referrals, and potentially great friends. It takes time but it\u2019s paid off big for me. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\nAdd me on Instagram: GPStephan\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-05-12T22:32:34Z","tags":["how to make money from craigslist","how to make money using craigslist","how to post on craigslist for free","how to post on craigslist without getting flagged","real estate craigslist ads that work","craigslist real estate leads","craigslist real estate","craigslist real estate investor","how to make money on crigslist","craigslist real estate ad templates","how to make six figures","how to make 100000","how to make six figures on craigslist"],"title":"How I make SIX FIGURES from posting Real Estate listings on Craigslist","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gy6JXJKZbSY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gy6JXJKZbSY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gy6JXJKZbSY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gy6JXJKZbSY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gy6JXJKZbSY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"445","dislikeCount":"49","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3233","viewCount":"89717"}},{"id":"U6DFBJP8ST0","snippet":{"description":"One thing you probably don\u2019t realize is that I constantly doubt whether or not my video is \u201cgood enough\u201d to be uploaded.

I got my first credit card at 21 years old, after banks turned me down for a loan on real estate - this is from my experiences building my own credit. \n\nYour credit score shows banks how responsible you are with your money. The scores range from about 300-850, with the best rates being available to those who have a score above 740. It shows banks how likely you are to potentially default on a loan and they adjust their interest rate according to their risk. \n\nThey calculate your credit score based off several factors:\n-Length of credit history - the longer you\u2019ve had it, the higher the score\n-How much credit you have available to you - the more money you have available, the higher the score\n-How much of it you actually use - the less money you use, the higher the score - this is called utilization rate \n-On time payments - if you\u2019ve never had a late payment and always pay on time, the higher the score\n-The diversity of loans you\u2019ve had - if you have variety of credit cards, auto loans, home loans, the higher your score. \n-Total inquiries - this means that every time you apply for a loan or credit card, it\u2019s marked. The more times you apply, the higher risk you\u2019re seen, since people who apply for a lot of credit in a short amount of time might be desperate for money, so this temporarily lowers your score. But lets not worry about this since for most people just starting, it won\u2019t make a difference. \n\nCredit card misconceptions: \n-You do NOT need to pay interest to increase your credit score. Pay it off in full, you do not need to keep a small balance each month. \n-It does NOT hurt you to check your own credit score. I use CreditKarma regularly to keep track of my score and where it\u2019s at.\n-It\u2019s also false that having too many cards will decrease your score - the opposite is true. The more credit you have available, generally your debt-to-credit ratio will be a lot lower, which will increase your score. \n-Do NOT close out a credit card, especially if it\u2019s an old account. When you close a credit card, it also closes all that credit history - which is a huge component of a good score. Keep your credit cards open even if you don\u2019t use them, or if you pay an annual fee, see if they can downgrade the card to a free account. \n-NOT all debt is bad. There can be good debt - like a mortgage, or an auto loan where your money is better off invested somewhere else - or bad debt, which is that expensive Hawaiian vacation for $7000 that you couldn\u2019t afford but you did it anyway because you put it on a credit card. Debt is a great way to leverage your money and have it work for you, earning MORE money in your investments than you pay off in interest. \n\nNow keep in mind, a credit card is something to use responsibly. Just put a normal amount on the cards each month as you would cash or a debit card, and pay it off in full. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s really, really simple. Eventually you can take advantage of great credit card rewards that\u2019ll get you free trips and perks.

This is NOT meant for people who ask me somewhat specific questions - it\u2019s meant for the people who ask me if they should get their real estate license if they want to sell real estate, if they should reach out to their friend\/family and ask them about their real estate experiences, if they should start a business they've been researching for awhile. You get the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s totally normal to want someone\u2019s permission or approval before doing something - there\u2019s almost a \u201csafety in numbers\u201d mentality where if enough people agree with something, you\u2019re protected in the event it doesn\u2019t work out. It also shifts some of the responsibility from yourself and onto the other people who told you to do \u201cthis.\u201d However, it\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t wait around for someone to give you the approval or \u201cok\u201d that you should do something - it\u2019s very important to learn to get in the habit of making your own decisions and take full responsibility for it. Come up with your own decisions independent of what everyone else says.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t take other people\u2019s opinions into consideration. BUT, you shouldn\u2019t allow someone to have that much influence on you that their word is set in stone whether or not you do something. Consider everything you hear but come to the decision on your own. Learn to get in the habit of making your own decisions and deciding what you do.

While it does allow you to invest up to $18,000 per year of pre-tax money, reducing your taxable income and potentially saving you thousands, it may come at a cost depending on your situation and it\u2019s important to take everything into consideration. Feel free to add me on snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nWhat does a 401k do: It allows you to invest with pre-tax money so you have a larger amount upfront to invest with. You can contribute up to $18,000 per year to this account, or $24,000 per year if you\u2019re over the age of 50. The way it works is pretty straight forward - the money you contribute to a 401k is not taxed right now, but instead it\u2019s taxed when you reach retirement age of 59.5 - when hopefully you\u2019re in a lower tax bracket than you are right now, so you end up profiting the difference from what you would\u2019ve paid in taxes NOW, and the lower rate in the future (hopefully). \n\nThe biggest advantage here is that you have pre-tax money working for you. That $4500 you would\u2019ve paid, for instance, can be invested and grow to a substantial amount when you\u2019re much older. \n\nIf you\u2019re employed right now, you can check and see if your employer has a 401k plan - if they do, speak with your employer and go ahead and you can begin contributing to it. Sometimes your employer will offer you a FREE match up to a certain amount - this is pretty much just free money, so you should go ahead and contribute up to the match. \n\nIf you\u2019re self employed, you have the benefit of opening up a SEP \/ SOLO 401K - this is a 401k plan that you can contribute to as both the employer and the employee, allowing you to contribute up to $54,000 of income. \n\nIf you\u2019re not employed, don\u2019t worry about it - but consider making some money and opening up the IRA account. \n\nGenerally speaking, a 401k makes the most sense if you\u2019re making  a lot of money right now and intend to retire in a lower tax bracket. This means you pay less taxes right now, and then when you retire in a lower tax bracket, you profit the difference from what you pay today and the lower amount you\u2019ll pay in the future. You also have MUCH more money working for you right off the bat than if you went with a Roth account, which is done with after-tax money. But chances are, if you\u2019re young and expect to continue to earn a lot more money into the future and in retirement, do your research most likely a Roth IRA is going to be a slightly better choice. \n\nHowever, unlike a Roth IRA where you can withdraw your contributions without penalty\u2026in a 401k, you must leave your money in there. If you take it out, it\u2019s subject to taxes and a 10% penalty unless under specific circumstance - so I recommend just leaving it in there. \n\nNow, lets discuss a few downsides I personally see with the 401k option. \n\n1. Lack of liquidity. You tie up your money long term. \n2. Your employer plan could have really high fees. Seriously, if your employer has a plan that charges something like 2% per year, that could dramatically reduce your returns. \n3. There\u2019s a chance you retire in a higher tax bracket. That\u2019s one of my biggest worries for myself personally, is that even though I\u2019m earning a lot right now, I have no intention of this decreasing during retirement - I actually want to make more money when I retire. \n4. Your money is subject to market risk. This is pretty much unavoidable, but there is risk - and i\u2019ll cover this risk in future videos. \n\nPersonally, I recommend doing a little bit of everything - I have a Roth IRA account and a 401k, so I contribute to both just to give me more options. No one really knows what the future will hold and what taxes will be like in 40 years, so doing a little bit of both hedges your bet and gives you a bit of a safety net. With this said, this video is just meant to be an introduction to a 401k and its options so you could continue to do your research and determine what\u2019s right for you!\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-06-30T21:51:01Z","tags":["what is a 401k","how to invest in a 401k","401k vs ira","401k vs roth ira","traditional 401k","401k plan","roth 401k","401k for dummies","401k explained","401k investing","how 401k works","how to make more money","how to save on income taxes","how to save on taxes","retirement accounts","how to retire","how to retire early","how to retire a millionaire","grant cardone","tai lopez","dave ramsey","dave ramsey 401k"],"title":"One of the BEST way to save on taxes: What is a 401k","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/347lZ0PfIPk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/347lZ0PfIPk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/347lZ0PfIPk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/347lZ0PfIPk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/347lZ0PfIPk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"200","dislikeCount":"36","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2009","viewCount":"48489"}},{"id":"ytR4sqWtBX0","snippet":{"description":"This is one simple piece of advice to be successful that's so common sense, yet so few people actually do it.

While these books aren\u2019t the how-to types with real estate and investments, these books would give a solid foundation to wealth, business, and mindset that have made a significantly impact on me. Enjoy! Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan  -- Top 5 picks below:\n\nYour money or your life - https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThis one really puts your time into perspective with regard to how much something costs you, compared with how much time you spend making money. If you work at $20\/hour and a dinner costs you $40, the dinner is 2 hours of your time - thinking of expenses like this shows you the value of your time and learning to make the most of it.\n\nThink and Grow Rich - https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nThis is a classic that I\u2019ve read MULTIPLE times. In fact, I likely read this one at least once per year - you can also find it on YouTube as an audiobook. Think and Grow Rich simplifies the techniques some of the most successful people have used in achieving their wealth, and what they all have in common. This is a MUST READ for anyone interested. \n\nThe Millionaire Next Door - https:\/\/goo.gl\/KaDa7R\nNot all millionaires live flashy lives or come from family money - in fact, the vast majority of millionaires are first generation wealthy. Most of them live very modestly, most of them are business owners, and most of them live under the radar. This book is great to put this in perspective and surveys actual millionaires and how they created their wealth. \n\nThe 4 Hour Work Week - https:\/\/goo.gl\/xqmhGE\nThis was one of the books that inspired me to begin creating passive income. While so many entrepreneurs and business people preach \u201chustling 24\/7, working all the time, never sleeping,\u201d Timothy Ferris takes the opposite approach - work as little as possible. This book is a great foundation to creating passive income and leveraging your time with the resources around you. \n\nAwaken the Giant Within - https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThis is one of my favorite self-help books. Anthony Robins speaks about limiting beliefs and how to overcome the mental obstacles that could be holding you back. I\u2019m a believer that success first starts from within, so this is a great book to realize what would mentally be holding you back from achieving what you want. \n\nThanks so much for watching!","publishedAt":"2017-06-23T22:03:50Z","tags":["best business books","best success books","best self help books","recommended business books","recommended self help books","recommended success books","awaken the giant within","tony robbins","anthony robbins","the millionaire next door","the 4 hour work week","timothy ferriss","your money or your life","think and grow rich","napoleon hill","self help books","business books","grant cardone","real estate","investing books","real estate books"],"title":"Top 5: Favorite Books for Business, Wealth, and Success","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DOoCAyu2wrc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DOoCAyu2wrc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DOoCAyu2wrc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DOoCAyu2wrc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DOoCAyu2wrc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M56S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"313","dislikeCount":"21","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4236","viewCount":"100080"}},{"id":"2KTe4Ll-krQ","snippet":{"description":"This is one of those things I wished I would\u2019ve learned and had done when I was younger - open up a Roth IRA retirement account. And because it saves you from paying taxes on your earnings and profits later on, I\u2019m all about it. So this is what a Roth IRA is and this is why it\u2019s so important to have one! Click \u201cSHOW MORE\u201d to read my full thoughts. Also feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan \n\nSo here\u2019s what it is - and because this confused me when I was younger, I\u2019ll break it down as simple as possible.\n\nA Roth IRA is a type of investment account that you can set up where you invest your money today - up to $5500 per year with no immediate tax deductions - and can pull out your profits and earnings tax free when you\u2019re 59.5. That means you pay NO TAX on YEARS of compounded interest and earnings. Your tax free profits just makes you MORE tax free profits. And it snowballs into a LOT of money. \n\nThis is best done when you\u2019re young for a few reasons\u2026the money you invest in a Roth IRA is done post tax, which means taxes are already taken out of the money that you earn at the time you invest it. So if you make $20,000 from a job, you might be left with only $17,000 after paying taxes\u2026so this $17,000 is now \u201cpost tax\u201d money. The reason is best when you\u2019re young is that chances are, you\u2019re not earning a ton of money compared to what you WILL be earning. When you\u2019re earning a lot of money, it\u2019s about reducing what you owe in taxes because the more money you make, the more money you\u2019re generally taxed. When you\u2019re not earning a lot of money, you\u2019re already in a lower tax bracket, so it\u2019s advantageous to take advantage of that and pay the taxes now to invest - because in the future, you\u2019ll hopefully earn a lot more money. Especially if you\u2019re 18-30 and not earning a lot of money, this is PERFECT for you. When you start earning more money, there are other accounts that might make more sense for your situation. \n\nSo here\u2019s what I would do: If you\u2019re under the age of 18 and have a job that you\u2019re making money with, you can ask your parents to open a Roth IRA account for you. From there, you contribute money you\u2019re making from your job - keep in mind you cannot contribute more than you earn, so if you earn $1000 that year, you can only contribute $1000. \n\nIf you\u2019re over the age of 18, right after this video is done, just go online and sign up for a Roth IRA. I use Vanguard and they\u2019re awesome, many people use Charles Schwab or Fidelity - just make sure the account has low fees. You can contribute up to $5500 of earned income every year - if you make too much money, you can look into doing a backdoor Roth IRA contribution. I recommend putting in as much as you can afford and forgetting about it. The advantage is that since there\u2019s compounded interest, the sooner you put your money in, on average, the more you\u2019ll have by the time you retire.\n\nIs this a boring investment strategy? Yes. But it\u2019s effective. I recommend just doing this on the side with what you can afford, while continuing to invest elsewhere or investing in yourself. \n\nJust to give you some ideas, if you invest $1000 per year at 18 and retire at 60, you\u2019ll have $264,000\u2026of that, you only contributed $43,000 over 42 years, meaning you just made $221,000 of tax free money. \n\nIf you invest $2000 per year at 18, same situation as above, you\u2019ll have invested $86,000 and made $444,000 of tax free money.\n\nIf you invest the maximum right now of $5500 per year at 18 years old, you\u2019ll have invested $231,000 and made over $1,200,000 in tax free money. If you just do $5500 per year at 18 years old, you can retire a millionaire without doing anything else. This average figure includes inflation, by the way. \n\nI hope this video helps and that this sets you up for future financial independence. \n\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\nAdd me on Instagram: GPstephan\n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-06-20T21:48:40Z","tags":["what is a roth IRA","roth ira","how to invest in roth ira","what is a roth ira and how does it work","what is a roth ira account","what is a roth","tax advantaged investments","retirement planning","retirement accounts","retirement accounts explained","retirement accounts for dummies","millionaire","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","roth ira vs 401k","roth ira investing","vanguard","roth ira vanguard","dave ramsey","roth ira investment options"],"title":"$5500 per year to tax-free Millionaire: Why you need a Roth IRA","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2KTe4Ll-krQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2KTe4Ll-krQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2KTe4Ll-krQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2KTe4Ll-krQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2KTe4Ll-krQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3024","dislikeCount":"693","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"18215","viewCount":"711196"}},{"id":"9nHDT5XL4KY","snippet":{"description":"As an investor, buyer, or wholesaler, finding a good deal in Real Estate can be time consuming and nearly impossible in a seller\u2019s market, but it\u2019s totally doable. These are a few of the top strategies I use to find the best deals and possibly find some off-market opportunities in real estate. Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nFirst, you need to see EVERYTHING you can on the market. Everything. You won\u2019t be able to know a good deal if you don\u2019t already know everything else on the market and what it\u2019s selling for. Without a solid foundation of how one home compares to another, you won\u2019t be able to realize a home\u2019s true value. \n\nNext, see homes as soon as they come on the market. You should be getting notified hourly about every new home that comes up or reduces its price. If something comes up that looks interesting, go and see it immediately. If it\u2019s a good deal, which you\u2019ll know by seeing everything else on the market, write an offer immediately. \n\nYou should also focus on listings which have been on the market for a long time that people may have forgotten about. Sometimes these listings get overlooked, and sometimes the owner is extremely motivated to sell but won\u2019t want to reduce their price quite yet. \n\nIgnore how the pictures look - sometimes great listings have the worst pictures, and the worst listings have the best pictures. Instead, focus on the location, square footage, condition, and price. \n\nWhen trying to find a property off market:\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to go door-to-door. Unfortunately it\u2019s time consuming and many times nothing will pan out, however if you find the one home that will sell at a reasonable price, all of your time spent will be worthwhile.\n\nYou can also send letters out to everyone in a particular area asking if they would sell. This can be expensive and time consuming depending on how many you send out, but one deal will pay for itself, plus some. \n\nFinally, looking through past listings which never sold could be a good option. You know they thought of selling at some point, so there\u2019s a higher likelihood they\u2019ll still sell. \n\nWith these above options, you\u2019ll have a great chance at finding a good deal - even in a seller\u2019s market. I use these same strategies above and it\u2019s worked very well, both for myself and for my clients. \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-06-15T22:29:56Z","tags":["how to find a good deal in real estate","how to find a good deal","how to find wholesale properties","how to find wholesale real estate","real estate investing","how to find real estate properties","how to find off market properties","how to find a good deal on a house","how to find off market real estate","grant cardone real estate","tai lopez real estate","how to find the best deal in real estate","real estate wholesale","real estate","investing in real estate","where to find real estate"],"title":"How to find a good deal \/ off market properties in Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9nHDT5XL4KY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9nHDT5XL4KY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9nHDT5XL4KY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9nHDT5XL4KY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9nHDT5XL4KY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"240","dislikeCount":"87","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3880","viewCount":"122224"}},{"id":"Z8pVlfulkcw","snippet":{"description":"So which is the \"better\" investment...stocks or real estate? In this video, I do my best to break down the pros and cons of each option and weigh the results against the potential return one could possibly expect to achieve. Since picking individual stocks can vary so widely in price, as would flipping a house, I'm comparing long term rental real estate to an total stock market index fund. \n\nIt\u2019s a hard question to answer, and a lot comes down to personal preference, but these are some things to take into consideration before we break down the numbers. Just for clarification - picking individual stocks, day trading, or swing trading is NOT included - you could achieve much higher returns and many people do this. However, since you could also invest and flip real estate, I felt this would be an unfair comparison with too many variables - which is why index funds vs rental properties were used. \n\nEach have their upsides and downsides\u2026\n\nPros for index fund investing:\n-It\u2019s completely passive. Once you spend a few minutes going to a website and buying a stock, you\u2019re done. \n-You don\u2019t need tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of dollars like you generally need with rental real estate. \n-There are no hassles of working with tenants, fixing items, or maintenance. \n-You can buy index funds within a tax advantaged account such as an IRA or 401k. \n-Stocks are fairly liquid and you can cash out quickly when you want to sell.\n\nPros for real estate investing:\n-You have total control over what you buy and at what price\n-You can take advantage of undervalued properties and areas\n-You can add square footage, remodel, and gain quick equity and increase cash flow\n-You can leverage your money and achieve potentially higher returns\n-You can receive consistent rental income\n\nIn terms of the raw returns, generally real estate CAN yield a higher return, usually if you leverage your money - HOWEVER, the higher return is balanced by the amount of work, skill, and knowledge needed to find the right deal and close on the right price. Real estate is also not an entirely passive investment, so even though you can make significantly more, it also comes with more work. If you\u2019re looking for something entirely passive, stocks will likely yield a little less but it comes with the ease of not having any responsibilities or obligations. So much of it comes down to personal preference. My recommendation is to do both :)\n\nAdd me on Snapchat: GPStephan\nAdd me on Instagram: GPstephan\n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-06-13T21:09:21Z","tags":["stocks vs real estate","is real estate a good investment","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","stock market vs real estate","stock market investment","real estate investment","how to invest in rental property","tai lopez","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest money for beginners","how to invest money","how to invest 10000 dollars","pros and cons of real estate","pros and cons of stocks"],"title":"Pros and Cons of Stocks vs Real Estate: Is one better than the other?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Z8pVlfulkcw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Z8pVlfulkcw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Z8pVlfulkcw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Z8pVlfulkcw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Z8pVlfulkcw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M58S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"678","dislikeCount":"116","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4345","viewCount":"123421"}},{"id":"Mqi9QTKI7Gs","snippet":{"description":"This is for anyone who is learning a new topic, but hasn't yet started.

These are my top 6 reasons WHY I invest the majority of my time and money in real estate. Forewarning: There\u2019s no \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d investment\u2026some people prefer stocks, some real estate, some \u201cother,\u201d there\u2019s no best or worst here. But this is why I like real estate!

Leverage. This is probably one of the biggest reasons people like investing in real estate - you can borrow the majority of the money to fund your own deal. The interest can also be a tax deduction. \n\n2. You have total control over the investment. Unlike stocks, in Real Estate you control the tenant you pick, the upgrades you do, if you want to add square footage and increase the home\u2019s value. Everything is totally up to you, and it\u2019s about finding the right balance between which upgrades yield the highest returns.\n\n3. Cash flow. This is why I favor Real estate over dividend stocks, for example. The cash flow from real estate can be higher, long term, than from stocks. Additionally, the cash flow from real estate can be depreciated on paper to show a net loss on a tax return, while still making money. This is unlike dividend income which is taxed as ordinary income, unless held in a tax-advantaged account like a Roth \/ Traditional IRA, 401K, etc. \n\n4. Potentially for the property to increase in value. While I don\u2019t expect this to happen, typically homes increase in value on par with inflation. I do not like speculating real estate markets or riding a wave of appreciation to riches, BUT, if it happens\u2026great. If not, that\u2019s fine because you shouldn\u2019t base your entire investment around a potentially increasing real estate market.\n\n5. Tax write offs. Everything in real estate is a tax write off. You can write off the interest you pay on a mortgage, the expenses, the depcretion of the property, cost segregation analysis\u2026the sky is the limit. \n\n6. It\u2019s not a full time job. You can invest in real estate on the side while keeping your normal day job. While it does require some up front work, once setup, real estate can be fairly passive.\n\nThat\u2019s it!

But is a degree worth it and is it worth the cost? This is a question I get asked all the time, because it seems like the next logical choice after high school. But spending 4 more years in school, and 4 years of tuition doesn\u2019t always equate to more success - it might actually set you back. Add me on Instagram \/ Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nCollege is not an indicator of how successful one will be, or how much money one can make. A degree is certainly a great safety net that can get you in the door for employers - it\u2019s also a requirement for certain professions. But depending on how entrepreneurial you are, it could cost you quite a lot of time and money that you could spend developing your business and skills. \n\nIt\u2019s a big choice to make that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly, and it\u2019s a highly personal choice. Sometimes a college degree is totally worth it, other times it might be a waste. It could be a great way to socialize and meet lifelong friends, or it could be a very expensive 4 years. \n\nIf your goal is in real estate, college is not a requirement to succeed, where your time is better spent directly learning your trade. While a degree can be a great safety net, there are many circumstances where it's totally unnecessary*\n\n*Your mileage may vary ;)\n\n\nThanks again for watching!

I was given the same lecture of \u201chow you can\u2019t be successful in real estate at 18 years old\u201d and it\u2019s totally untrue. These are the top 6 advantages you have by being young and inexperienced. My last video: https:\/\/goo.gl\/9sHRCg\n\n1. You\u2019re memorable. Because so few people start a business or sell real estate at such a young age, it\u2019s easy to stand out. Being this different has its perks and people remember that! \n\n2. You\u2019re non threatening. No one is worried about you stealing their business, their clients, or trying to pull a fast one. They\u2019re more likely to go easy on you.\n\n3. People want to give you a chance. I\u2019ve noticed that most older, successful people really go out of their way to help you out when you\u2019re that much younger. Definitely use this while you still can!\n\n4. You likely have a low overhead without a lot of expenses. It\u2019s a lot easier to begin a new business before you have a mortgage, kids, a wife, and other payments to handle - now is the perfect time before life begins to slow you down.\n\n5. You know social media really, really well - it should come completely second nature by now, without a learning curve. Everything you need to know if easily searchable on the internet!\n\n6. You\u2019re coachable. You\u2019re a completely clean slate that hasn\u2019t had years of repetition and routine that\u2019s hard to change. You don\u2019t have any bad habits that you need to break - instead, you can learn fresh from the ground up.\n\nRemember that you still need to be a professional and treat it like a business, regardless of how old you are.

Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nFirst step: Learn as much as you can. EVERYTHING is free. If you want to be a real estate investor, real estate agent, stock trader, investor\u2026anything, you can learn almost everything online and on YouTube. Use this to your advantage. \n\nSecond step: Get firsthand experience. Learning is one component, but having firsthand experience is invaluable. Do whatever you can to get your foot in the door - volunteer, work for free, work part time, do anything you can to get the experience to learn.\n\nThird step: Try as many things as you can. You might not like what you initially thought you wanted to do - I thought I wanted to be an investment banker in high school ;) Then I found real estate and the rest was history.\n\nFourth step: Take risks. You have very little to lose and a LOT to gain. Even if you fail, these experiences are priceless and will help you going forward.\n\nThanks again for watching, I hope this helps! \n\nFor business\/music inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-08-28T21:59:36Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate wholesaling","how to make money in real estate","how to make money as a teen","how to make money at 16","how to make money online","how to be successful","advice for teens","how to sell products online","amazon fba","how to amazon fba","how to sell products"],"title":"My advice to be successful if you\u2019re a teenager watching YouTube right now\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WQewIqe2ekw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WQewIqe2ekw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WQewIqe2ekw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WQewIqe2ekw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WQewIqe2ekw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"308","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1764","viewCount":"34681"}},{"id":"YFqLMcqbcok","snippet":{"description":"LAST RENOVATION VIDEO: https:\/\/youtu.be\/iBOeQv7zzgI\n\nI'm likely about 2 weeks away from being completely, totally, and finally finished with this project.

While I have nothing but massive respect for him, and while don\u2019t disagree with him or anything he says, this is why I haven\u2019t yet ventured into 16+ unit properties and instead, why I\u2019ve been investing in 1-4 unit buildings around Southern California. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nDisclosure - I\u2019m an avid subscriber of Grant Cardone and really appreciate what he puts out there. In real estate, there are a million ways to invest - it\u2019s certainly not a one-size-fits-all approach. While you can\u2019t argue with his success, and while I don\u2019t disagree with him at all, these are my perspectives and points of view for the location and market where I\u2019m investing. Every single market is different and requires a more tailored technique depending on your cash flow goals, long term outlook, and area. What Grant does is extremely effective, and I have nothing but respect for him, although my preference so far - given my price range, location, and selection of deals - has led me to 1-4 unit properties. \n\nWhat Grant says (summed up to a few basic points):\n1. Buy minimum of 16 units. The more units you have, the more tenants you have paying you, which spreads out your risk of losing rent during vacancy. \n2. Economy of scale helps where you have one single building to repair and service with multiple tenants. \n3. With 16+ units, you can hire a manager. \n\nMy thoughts:\n1. It\u2019s absolutely true that having more units reduces your risk of losing 100% of your rent, as you would if you had a single tenant paying you 100% of your rent. However, from what I\u2019ve found, vacancy rates are about the same between 16+ units and less than 4 units. It\u2019s difficult to estimate vacancy rates as it entirely depends on the location - and can vary wildly - but between two places in a similar location, they should each have about the same vacancy rate. So while I absolutely agree with him that it spreads out your risk, you should experience about the same amount of vanancy between both 2-4 units and 16+ units. \n2. Economy of scale is another valid point. However, keep in mind that with 16 units, you have 16 kitchens, 16 toilets, 16 things to break. The cost to fix one toilet for a tenant paying $450 per month is the same as it is to fix one toilet for a tenant paying $4500 per month. Having one building can be a LOT simpler to manage from the perspective of having one single location, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019ll be less work than a high paying 2-4 unit place. \n3. Hiring a manager is vital for something with that many units. This should be factored in your expenses and anticipated rate of return. I self manage my 1-4 unit properties and it doesn\u2019t take more than a few hours per month, fairly manageable. This would be much more if I were to manage a 16+ unit place on my own. \n\nFor Grant, I totally understand why he prefers larger deals - when your dealing with $10m+ buildings, the rents you get on a few units for $10m rarely ever makes sense\u2026. it doesn\u2019t make sense to buy 50 houses to rent out. That would be a huge hassle. In the larger deals of 5 million dollars or more, having one asset vs a dozen houses makes life a lot easier.\n\nThe thing that I\u2019ve discovered is that it all comes down to your return. It\u2019s just money. It\u2019s what will make you the most money for your investment. And generally speaking, they all tend to average about the same. You can increase these returns by buying something that needs work, renovating, and re-renting it out with higher returns - but you can also do the same with smaller multi family or apartments, it\u2019s all the same. For me, I\u2019ve focused on houses and under-4 unit buildings because they\u2019ve generated the highest returns from where I\u2019ve looked in my location. And because I\u2019m not buying $5,000,000+ places in LA, the under-4 units make the most sense. \n\nTo sum things up, I don\u2019t disagree with Grant but real estate is so location dependent that one technique isn\u2019t necessarily better than another. It\u2019s highly personalized and at the end of the day, I go with what brings me the highest returns for where I want to invest. It all comes down to personal preference and where you get the best value. \n\nThanks again for watching! \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-08-24T21:44:08Z","tags":["grant cardone","real estate investing","multi family real estate","multi family real estate investing","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","how to buy real estate","how to buy rental property","how to buy investment real estate","best investment 2017","grant cardone investing","grant cardone 16 unit"],"title":"Lets talk about Grant Cardone and why I don\u2019t buy 16+ unit properties","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Le6qjQ7iMU4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Le6qjQ7iMU4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Le6qjQ7iMU4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Le6qjQ7iMU4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Le6qjQ7iMU4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M48S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1280","dislikeCount":"1051","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8030","viewCount":"479585"}},{"id":"AwLwIgmzDWM","snippet":{"description":"One of the things I haven\u2019t really covered yet in my videos is the risks of investing and how to recover from a market crash, especially now with stocks at their all time highs. But is it possible to time the market? And what\u2019s the best time to invest? Well, according to statistics, doing THIS is what generates the highest profits. Thanks for watching! Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nHere\u2019s the stock market timing game!\nhttps:\/\/qz.com\/487013\/this-game-will-show-you-just-how-foolish-it-is-to-sell-stocks-right-now\/\n\nIf you expose your money to any type of market, you expose your money to risk - it\u2019s unavoidable. But markets are cyclical and there will be a time when the markets go down and you see some losses.. It\u2019s totally normal. That lends the question - since the markets continuously hit all time highs, is it a good time to sell and then wait for a crash? Statistically, it\u2019s shown that market timing rarely ever works - it\u2019s impossible to know exactly when the market will crash and when to buy back in. Hypothetically if this is possible and you can do it consistently, great - but the chances of doing this consistently and accurately rarely ever happens, and it\u2019s shown that time in the market yields higher average returns than timing the market. \n\nStudies by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean\u00a0find that individual investors experience reduced returns with their stock trading accounts, with increased active trading a key reason in lowering returns. Examining 66,465 US household trading accounts over the 1991 \u2013 1996 period, Barber and Odean find that the average household account earned an annual return of 16.4% over the period, compared to the 17.9% market return. Those households which traded most earned an annual return of 11.4%.\nhttp:\/\/faculty.haas.berkeley.edu\/odean\/papers%20current%20versions\/behavior%20of%20individual%20investors.pdf\n\nThey\u2019ve also determined less than 1% of households were able to reliably predict market cycles between 1992-2006. \n\nI\u2019m personally against market timing because no one truly knows when the next crash could be. If you pull out now, you could miss a few more years of gains. If you sell now and it crashes, how do you know when the bottom hits and when to buy back in? There have been numerous studies that show that the more you tinker with your investments, the higher the probability of achieving lower returns than if you had just stuck it out and held on to your investment. \n\nNow speaking of risk and all-time highs in the market, what about a large upfront lump sum investment NOW, or slowly putting it in the market over time? Or waiting until the market is down, and then investing a lump sum? \n\nCharles Shchwab ran the numbers from 1993-2012 for each investment strategy. \nIf you start with $2000 per year available at the beginning of each year, and bought at the YTD low every year, this resulted in $87,004.\nIf you just invest immediately as soon as you have it, you\u2019d have $81,650.\nIf you invested $2000 equally every month over the course of the year, you\u2019d have $79,510\nIf you had bad timing and bought at the YTD high, you\u2019d have $72,487.\nAnd if you had cash investments, you\u2019d be left with $51,291. \nhttp:\/\/www.schwab.com\/public\/schwab\/nn\/articles\/Does-Market-Timing-Work\n\nThe study concludes that the most reliable investment method has always been to buy immediately, and hold. Do not try to time the markets. \n\nSo how do you deal with risks and the possibility of losing money? First, don\u2019t invest money you will for sure need in the next 2-5 years. For all other investments, have a long term outlook - don\u2019t be too short sighted to panic sell or try to time the market as soon as it\u2019s down. Instead, you should see this as a long term 10-20 year play. \n\nAccording to research conducted by Charles Schwab Company in 2012, between 1926 and 2011, a 20-year holding period never produced a negative result!!\n\nFor business\/music inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-08-18T22:02:48Z","tags":["market crash","market crash 2017","stock market crash","how to invest in stocks","how not to lose money in stocks","how not to lose money","investing 101","real estate 101","how to invest in the stock market","stock market investments","real estate investing","investing basics","real estate","penny stocks","stock trading 101","grant cardone","tai lopez"],"title":"What to do if the Stock Market Crashes - Without Losing Money! *According to Statistics*","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AwLwIgmzDWM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AwLwIgmzDWM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AwLwIgmzDWM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AwLwIgmzDWM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AwLwIgmzDWM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"243","dislikeCount":"36","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"850","viewCount":"27150"}},{"id":"Tof5GMD0akc","snippet":{"description":"After remodeling 5 properties and spending in the six-figures doing so, these are the top 7 mistakes I\u2019ve made along the way that you can avoid - and hopefully this will end up saving you a lot of money in the future!  Enjoy! \u2014 Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\n1. Going with Cheap Materials. You save a lot of money upfront going with cheap materials. Especially as a rental, it\u2019s a fine balance between the cost of an item and what gets the most return from rent. Although cheap materials might save you in the short term, they end up costing you more money long term when they break or need to be replaced. Cheap flooring is one of the big ones - spend a little extra money on durable, long lasting floors. Same with paint. \n\n2. Not fixing everything you can. Don\u2019t put something off because it doesn\u2019t need to be repaired right now. When remodeling a property, it\u2019s a lot easier to get it done the right way, immediately, than put it off until it gets worse. For me, this has frequently been electrical and plumbing. Do not let it get to the point of breaking at 1am before you take action to fix it - get it done now, spend the extra money because you\u2019ll need to do it anyway at some point, so get it done sooner than later. \n\n3. Going with carpet for rentals. Carpet is another one of those things that\u2019s cheap to get done, looks good, but needs to be replaced so often. In a rental, carpet gets dirty and disgusting very, very quickly and needs to be changed out between renters. Replacing carpet once will be more expensive than just having done laminate floors from the beginning. \n\n4. Underestimating repairs. It\u2019ll always be more expensive than what you think. When you start remodeling, you begin noticing all the other small items that you should fix. Unexpected items always come up. When you start to open walls, you find more problems. I recommend adding on 10-20% of the project in your mind and expect to go over budget. It\u2019ll cost you more than you think.\n\n5. Underestimating time. It always takes longer than you think for that exact reason. You end up doing more work, it takes longer, people run late, it happens. Give yourself an extra few weeks for every process to give yourself a more realistic time frame.\n\n6. Not knowing what I was doing. Don\u2019t be completely blind to the process and do your own research. Landscape example. Watch youtube videos.\n\n7. Trust the workers entirely. People are people and they make mistakes. Even if they don\u2019t, sometimes what you have in your head doesn\u2019t translate and communicate well to someone else. You\u2019ll need to supervise and watch over the work to make sure it\u2019s being done as you want it.\n\nOverall, follow these 7 mistakes that I have made and learn from my experiences. Hopefully this will end up saving you a lot of money if you end up renovating your own place! \n\nThanks again for watching! \n\nFor business\/music inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-08-15T22:30:56Z","tags":["how to remodel a house","how to renovate a house","how to buy a rental property","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in rental property","grant cardone","tai lopez","how to wholesale","how to make money in real estate","how to get passive income","rental property","cheap bathroom remodel","house remodel","renovation project","remodeling project"],"title":"Top 7 Renovation Mistakes - AVOID THESE!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Tof5GMD0akc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Tof5GMD0akc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Tof5GMD0akc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Tof5GMD0akc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Tof5GMD0akc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"250","dislikeCount":"52","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2904","viewCount":"90854"}},{"id":"IdJyh-ZlqqQ","snippet":{"description":"One of the most important things you can learn is how to sell. Everything you do, in some way or another, revolves around selling - either yourself, your services, or your product. You\u2019ll need to communicate your value to other people in a way that they can understand and relate to, without coming across as pushy. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan - SHOW MORE\n\nIt's a lot more difficult than you think to effectively communicate your product or yourself to someone else. Most people will never put in the time to realizing this, so just by taking the time to improve yourself, you\u2019re immediately setting yourself apart from almost everyone else. \n\nStep 1: Know the advantages you have and what makes you stand out from everyone else. What makes you better? How can you improve someone else\u2019s experience? What problem does this solve? Write them down. It needs to be a win-win.\n\nStep 2: Communicate with enthusiasm. If you don\u2019t believe what you say, neither will anyone else. \n\nStep 3: Know who your audience is and how to target them. Make sure they want or need your services or product before pitching yourself. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve realized what your advantages and selling points are, do your best to internalize it. If you\u2019re an employee, understand what you do better than anyone else. If you\u2019re selling real estate, don\u2019t just sell the house - sell yourself as a professional and demonstrate what sets you apart from everyone else.

The biggest tips: decreases your expenses as much as you can, save as much as you can, and work on increasing income. Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\n1. Decreasing expenses. I\u2019d view all the money I didn\u2019t spend as additional income, because I was money I had \u201csaved.\u201d Weird mental gymnastics, I know, but avoiding spending $50 on dinner or $40 on drinks was just like I had \u201cmade\u201d that much money by not spending it. \n\n2. All the money you save is in your control. It\u2019s also easier to save $20 by not spending it, than it is to make additional money to pay for it. For instance, an increase of $20\/day income is really more like $14 after taxes. So you need to make $20 to pay for a $14 item, after taxes. \n\n3. Viewing money instead of at its face value, but at its investment return. $100,000 isn\u2019t $100,000\u2026it\u2019s $10,000 a year for life in rental income, for example. \n\n4. Work on increasing your income. You can\u2019t get something for nothing, so obviously this still requires you to go out and make money. \n\nFrom there, you should start to begin to see an increase in savings, which you can then use to begin investing. In the mean time, continue to do your research, read as much as you can, and learn as much as you can with regards to investing.

Add me on Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to make money as a Real Estate Agent, build your network of clients, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nTo me, my priority and focus has been to build up my passive income as much as possible, year after year- so far, in the 6 years that I\u2019ve been investing, my income from my rental properties covers pretty much all of my expenses, allowing me to save 100% of what I make from working as a realtor. \n\nThis is the type of investing I prefer - partly due to laziness in that I can continue to increase my passive income and grow that up to be able to retire whenever and have total freedom to do what I want, when I want, and partly because it\u2019s less time intensive than flipping properties. I take a very lazy, easy approach to real estate investing. It\u2019s slow and steady wins the race attitude. Once you set up a rental property with the right tenants, it can pretty much run on its own, making you money while you sleep. \n\nDisclosure: People can make a lot of money flipping. This isn\u2019t to say that it\u2019s not very, very lucrative - I know and have represented people that have made hundreds of thousands per deal. It can be a great business to be in and there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with it. Everyone\u2019s goals are different and many people prefer the immediate profit of a flip - But here are my own personal reasons why I prefer to keep my properties as rentals. \n\n1. It\u2019s a lot of work to flip a property, especially in a competitive market. Inventory is low and finding a deal worth flipping could take months. While it can generate a lot of profit immediately, it requires your constant work to keep the momentum to continue flipping.\n\n2. When you sell it, you pay taxes as ordinary income - not long term capital gains, which is taxed much less. \n\n3. Market timing. Finding a good deal could take months in Los Angeles\u2026add another 2-3 months of renovation, and another 30-60 days of having the house on the market before closing, and you\u2019re looking at 5-9 months from start to finish per deal. \n\n4. Profit. Given the amount of work and time I\u2019d dedicate to flip a property, it doesn\u2019t make sense for me when it takes my time away from my main focus, which is working as a Realtor. \n\n5. If the property has that much equity in it that you can flip it for a profit, chances are you can charge much higher rents than before, improving your cash flow. \n\nFor me, I\u2019ll take passive rents without doing much - it just requires some upfront work and an initial upfront investment, but once you get it going, it can run for a very long time. Having this type of passive income really allows you the freedom to do what you want, when you want - and focus on what really brings you the most joy. For this reason, I prefer rental properties over flipping. \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nAdd me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-08-03T22:29:37Z","tags":["how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","how to make passive income","passive income real estate","how to generate rental income","how to get rental income","how to flip properties","how to wholesale properties","how to buy a home","how to rent a home","financial independence","real estate investing explained","rental income property","real estate investing 101","real estate investing tips","rental income tips","grant cardone","tai lopez","gary vee","gary vaynerchuk"],"title":"Why I DON'T flip houses  (revealing my favorite real estate investing approach)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uh15keMBjf8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uh15keMBjf8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uh15keMBjf8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uh15keMBjf8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Uh15keMBjf8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M1S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"476","dislikeCount":"49","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3095","viewCount":"90523"}},{"id":"sA7o6cGekLk","snippet":{"description":"I\u2019m seeing a lot of articles lately about websites, technologies, and companies looking to replace the real estate agent. From Zillow Instant Offers and Open Listings, everyone is trying to disrupt the industry. Here are my thoughts. Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nHonestly, as a buyer and investor myself, the investor in me would love for there to be a streamlined process between buying and selling. I just wish everyone can level with each other, shake hands on a price over 5 minutes of negotiation, and call it a day, where both parties can be happy. But realistically, everything that\u2019s rolled out so far won\u2019t make much of an impact and the career of being a real estate agent will be thriving for a very long time. And the reason why is because real estate is often bought with emotion, not with logic. \n\nBuying a house is an emotionally-driven decision. It\u2019s one of the most expensive purchases someone will make in their lifetime, it\u2019s where they\u2019re going every night, it\u2019s where they\u2019re sleeping, it\u2019s where they\u2019ll create memories, it\u2019s where they\u2019ll raise a family and grow old. As a seller, your home is an extension of you - you spent your life\u2019s earnings on this place, you created memories here, this house is YOU. And technology can\u2019t effectively articulate emotion. \n\nHalf of what I do is act as a therapist. I\u2019m someone that people bounce ideas off of, I share experiences, stories, and opinions. I\u2019m someone they can trust for advice and techniques to get them the highest price. And it\u2019s important to objectively look at how someone is feeling and determine how you can best get them what they want. \n\nAs a real estate agent, you need to understand your value. Your value comes in the fact that buying and selling real estate is emotional and you need to learn to handle that to benefit your client. A good agent can make a 10%+ different in the selling price based off their techniques, photographs, selling strategy, etc. I\u2019ve seen random no-name agents just kill deals because they have no idea what they\u2019re doing. Then their sellers are left wondering why the property never sold. Sometimes it\u2019s mis-pricing it, something it\u2019s lack of advertising, sometimes it\u2019s lack of pictures, sometimes the agent just isn\u2019t available to show it. \n\nAnd sometimes you have to have your client move away from the emotional side when things become too difficult, and help guide them to logical. Sometimes clients get too logical and focused on the numbers to the point they forget this is the place where they\u2019re going to be spending the next 20 years of their life. Understanding the ups and downs is an advantage real estate agents have over programs and websites. It\u2019s less about being persuasive as it is giving an objective thought and making sure your client understands all angles before making a decision. \n\nBut WILL this take away from our business? I doubt it. It\u2019s all about effectively communicating your value and why you\u2019re worth what you charge. If you can do that, you won\u2019t have any problem. Because the truth is, a good agent is one who saves you more money than they cost. \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-09-29T21:00:02Z","tags":["real estate agent","how to be a real estate agent","how to be a realtor","real estate agent 101","realtor 101","grant cardone","tai lopez","gary vee","real estate investing"],"title":"The future of Real Estate: Are Real Estate Agents becoming obsolete?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sA7o6cGekLk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sA7o6cGekLk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sA7o6cGekLk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sA7o6cGekLk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sA7o6cGekLk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M37S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"158","dislikeCount":"29","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"649","viewCount":"20431"}},{"id":"vDcgiIxbMkk","snippet":{"description":"Since it\u2019s so important to see other perspectives and watch what other people are doing, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of chatting with Tanner J Fox, who\u2019s quickly built up an income of $300,000 per month in just a year by doing Amazon FBA, consulting, and selling courses.

This $1000 amount should give you a head start in whatever you do and begin the foundation to you making a lot more money. Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLet me first preface this by saying that it really depends WHAT you want to do and what your situation is. I\u2019ll give you my own recommendations, but ultimately your own situation will dictate what\u2019s actually best for you. If you want to start a business, I\u2019d likely give you different advice than if you want to invest long term in something passive. So I\u2019ll try to cover as much as I can. \n\nMy first and biggest piece of advice for anyone, no matter what you want to do, is to use that $1000 to invest in yourself. This will likely give you the highest return on investment. I\u2019m not talking about spending it all on a $997 course, but use it towards good books - use it towards learning, taking seminars, taking some courses or classes, and expanding your knowledge about what you want to do. Investing in yourself is a good idea no matter how much money you have and would be the pinnacle of what will generally get you the highest ROI. \n\nMy second piece of advice is for someone who wants to start a business. I\u2019d recommend using that $1000 to get you towards starting that business you want to do. If you want to develop a website, use that money to start the website. Want to start an app? Use that money to start an app. Do you want to do something online but don\u2019t have a computer capable of doing it? Use that money. If you want to wholesale real estate, use that $1000 towards marketing materials. Figure out what you want to do and see how you can stretch your $1000 to make your business a reality. Even if it fails miserably and you lose your $1000, I promise that will be the best learning experience of a lifetime. That $1000 mistake will be worth way more firsthand than any college class could ever teach you. \n\nMy third piece of advice is for someone who wants a more stable, long term investment they can pretty much just forget about to give them some passive returns. In this case, I\u2019d highly recommend a low-fee index fund, like what Vanguard offers. They have several funds with $1000 minimums that should get you a good head start on investing long term. You can also get a ton of diversification depending on what fund you go with and this would give you a solid foundation for investing. You\u2019ll also learn some background about index funds and diversification in long term investing. \n\nMy fourth piece of advice is for someone who wants to learn the stock market and doesn\u2019t mind putting their money in riskier investments. With this, you can trade individual stocks and you will learn a TON by trading firsthand. The downside is that commissions will eat you alive when you\u2019re making regular trades. BUT, it\u2019ll be an amazing learning experience. You can do the same with cryptocurrencies and I\u2019m sure it would be an equally good learning experience. Just understand the risks involved. \n\nThe whole purpose of this first $1000 should really just be to use it to jumpstart whatever it is that you want to do. Because lets be real, $1000 is not a lot in the bigger picture. However, $1000 should be enough to start moving you in the direction to begin making $10,000\u2026then $100,000\u2026then a $1,000,000. It\u2019s about creating a foundation that supports you to continue making even more money. It\u2019s not about maximizing your returns at this level, it\u2019s about creating learning experiences at this level where losing 10% costs you $100 vs losing 10% on $100,000 costs you $10,000. The mistakes you make on this level will be avoided when you begin doing things on a much larger scale. \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-09-22T21:30:06Z","tags":["How to invest 1000","how to invest 1000 dollars","how to invest 1000 in stocks","how to invest 1000 for a quick return","how to invest 1000 in real estate","how to invest","how to invest 1000 in bitcoin","real estate investing","stock market investing","real estate wholesaling","grant cardone","tai lopez","gary vaynerchuk","how to start investing","how to start investing in real estate"],"title":"The BEST ways to invest your first $1000","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SoZTAJJBHzg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SoZTAJJBHzg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SoZTAJJBHzg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SoZTAJJBHzg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SoZTAJJBHzg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M14S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"464","dislikeCount":"98","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4350","viewCount":"142464"}},{"id":"Bm2BhTxfHHI","snippet":{"description":"Leave your thoughts below! This is totally different from my other videos but I felt this was something worth discussing. So many channels are now getting demonetized, forced to only release \u201cPG\u201d content, and YouTube is pushing creators to conform with what advertisers want - a safe, PG-rated youtube video that everyone and their child can watch. But what happens when this pushes out the creators that we\u2019ve been watching for years and what will happen to the future of YouTube if people start leaving to go elsewhere? Let\u2019s talk about this. Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nIn the beginning, YouTube Algorithms were pretty relaxed about their ad revenue. Pretty much any channel could make money. And over the years, we\u2019ve seen some amazing content creators flourish because they were able to focus on youtube full time. they developed teams of businesses around their channel to create some hilarious and entertaining content.\n\nThen the adpolocalypse happened. For anyone who isn\u2019t aware, youtube was placing ads on controversial content - when this was discovered, advertisers freaked and pulled their ads from youtube until hey figured out a system that worked to prevent ads from playing on less-than-friendly videos. Ad revenue plummeted and my favorite channels stopped posting. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that youtube is a business and they want to keep their advertisers happy. that\u2019s their source of income for a website that costs them a TON of money to host. \n\nThen, advertisers slowly came back and things appeared to go back to normal. Until now. YouTube has passed even stricter bots that demonetize anything that could be controversial or not advertiser friendly. The problem is that YouTube\u2019s new algorithm in 2017 is so aggressive in what it thinks as unsuitable. Even though it\u2019s a self learning program, we\u2019re not sure at what point it\u2019ll stop and how many people this will effect. \n\nThe real issue here is censorship. It\u2019s allowing someone to create amazing content and create a living from expressing themselves without fear of not earning money - and making sure they\u2019re able to recognize which video is actually \u201cnot advertiser friendly,\u201d and which is okay. Certain words are triggers, but also certain titles - even if they\u2019re totally PG. Who knows what the future of YouTube is, it sure isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon, but a decline like this could force a TON of people to look elsewhere for their video-watching entertainment.\n\nFeel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-09-20T21:00:00Z","tags":["youtube algorithm 2017","youtube algorithm explained","youtube not suitable for all advertisers","not suitable for all advertisers","future of youtube","youtube demonitized","demonitized videos youtube","demonitized youtube","adpocalypse","adpocalypse youtube","adpocalypse youtube 2017","youtube algorithm now","youtube new algorithm"],"title":"The future of YouTube: Is it slowly getting worse and becoming too \u201cAdvertiser Friendly?\u201d","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bm2BhTxfHHI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bm2BhTxfHHI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bm2BhTxfHHI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bm2BhTxfHHI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bm2BhTxfHHI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M52S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"237","dislikeCount":"21","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"470","viewCount":"11382"}},{"id":"8mrX5pP3Usg","snippet":{"description":"One of my common comments I get a lot, especially with my recommendations to get a credit card and start building credit, are comments like \u201cDave Ramsey\u2019s head would spin if he heard this.\u201d And I used to be one of those people, growing up I was told that credit cards were awful and it wasn\u2019t until I was older did I realize that this was a terrible mentality to be in. Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nIf you don\u2019t already know who Dave Ramsey is, he\u2019s a financial speaker who teaches about money, and also has a youtube channel where he takes calls and answers questions. I\u2019d say he provides a pretty decent foundation for someone just getting into personal finance and financial independence - He focuses primarily on the average person with the average income and the average spending habit. Which, less face it, the average person has a terrible spending habit and usually loaded with debt from over spending. He\u2019s also terribly against credit cards and debt, to an extreme. \n\nI hate to say it, but from my experience, the average person isn\u2019t interested in finance, saving, and building wealth. I\u2019d like to go on a limb and say most people would rather increase their annual income and increase their spending by the same amount. Only a small percentage are more interested in saving and investing long term. The immediate gratification of cars, houses, vacations is a lot to resist\u2026so in this regard, Dave Ramsey comes on extremely hard in his approach to break that cycle that so many people get caught up in. \n\nThe thing is, I think this advice is perfect for the average person who has a spending problem. If you\u2019ve proven you can\u2019t responsibly handle money and debt, the best choice - psychologically speaking, is to cut it out entirely - no exceptions. This isn\u2019t a mathematically correct choice, but when humans deal with emotions, wants, and needs, this often over-rides what\u2019s really the \u201ccorrect\u201d thing to do. \n\nAnd that\u2019s what Dave is great at - he knows the spending psychology of his viewer. Many people who can\u2019t control themselves. So for this, I applaud him because his strict advice of no debt, no credit cards, cash only is the best possible outcome for someone climbing out of debt. If I were to say people as a whole could responsibly handle money, I\u2019d say no - they couldn\u2019t. Even you watching this right now - you\u2019re in the very small percentage of people actually interested in money and wealth building. So overall, Dave\u2019s advice is good\u2026for most people who are bad with money. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t the full picture. Credit cards are amazing when used responsibly. Want to buy a house and invest in real estate? You\u2019ll need good credit for that. Want a business loan to expand your products? Need good credit. Lease a car? Good credit. At a certain point, the money you borrow is paid back at a lower interest rate than what money makes you, so you can dramatically increase your income by leveraging yourself.\n\nGood credit for me has been the foundation of everything I do. One of my biggest mistakes was not getting a credit card sooner, because I was brought up with the mentality that credit cards were evil. If I had credit, I would have been able to double the amount of properties I was buying in 2012 vs buying fewer of them, cash. The thing is that it needs to be done responsibly. Like any financial tool, it can\u2019t be abused - it needs to be used wisely. Don\u2019t go and buy things you don\u2019t need just because you have credit - this is what Dave Ramsey is good at stopping. But for people with self control who understand the benefits of building their credit score and reaping the rewards, building credit could be one of the best things you do. At the end of the day, it\u2019s important to know yourself enough to do things responsibly. If you can\u2019t handle it, fine - at least you know that and not having a credit card\/debt is much better than maxing it out and moving on to the next one, while paying crazy high fees. But if you can handle it, get the credit card.\n\nFeel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-09-18T22:00:01Z","tags":["dave ramsey","dave ramsey credit card","how to build your credit score","credit cards 101","credit card debt","credit score increase","credit score tips","credit score explained","credit score to buy a house","dave ramsey credit card debt","dave ramsey credit repair","credit repair","david ramsey"],"title":"Let's talk about Dave Ramsey and why he doesn't like credit cards!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8mrX5pP3Usg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8mrX5pP3Usg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8mrX5pP3Usg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8mrX5pP3Usg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8mrX5pP3Usg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M36S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"749","dislikeCount":"137","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4563","viewCount":"141192"}},{"id":"fTuG40zFxG8","snippet":{"description":"Matt McKeever is a real estate investor in London Ontario, Canada who's quickly built up a portfolio of 16 rental properties - and over 80 tenants paying him rent - every single month.

That\u2019s a far difference from the person who\u2019s pulling in their entire paycheck from a single job, and this small difference could end up making you a lot of money over your career if you use it to your advantage. Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nIt really comes down to creating value with your time and doing things that lead you to what you want to achieve. \n\nIt usually begins like this:\n1. Main job - this is your priority\n2. Investments - the things you place your money in \n3. Side job - what else you can do with your time\n\nDoing this spreads out your risk. You don\u2019t have 100% of your money coming in from one source. If something happens to your main job, you\u2019re out. This allows you something to fall back on. It also allows you to focus on passive sources of income, or income that doesn\u2019t require 100% of your attention, which is money you can make in addition to your main job. If you ever want to scale back or have more free time, this is easier to achieve. It also allows you to better leverage your time. \n\nFor me, I have four sources of income:\n1. What I earn as a Real estate agent (my main job)\n2. Equity gained by buying properties and renovating them\n3. Rental properties\n4. Stock market income\n5. YouTube?\n\nSo you can see - main business, investments, and then side job. There\u2019s almost like a trickle-down affect where you have your primary source of income which can be funneled through other avenues to make you even more money, hopefully which require less attention than your main job. \n\nThe most successful people I see all have these income streams. Some of them have products they sell, some invest in real estate, some invest in stocks, and some own their own side businesses. It\u2019s less important about what they\u2019re doing, and more important to realize that this is one of the best things to do. \n\nSo what can you do? Figure out what you want - do you want something that\u2019s entirely passive? Do you want something that\u2019ll make you more where you\u2019re actively involved in? How much time do you have to dedicate to this? What do you like doing? There are also plenty of other passive income sources, like affiliate marketing, writing e-books, building apps, YouTube, website ad revenue, p2p lending\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a believer that more and more opportunity is shifting to online and mobile, so anything you can setup online will likely do well long term. I also like businesses that don\u2019t require 100% of your attention where you can leverage your time for something that works around the clock, so I\u2019d highly recommend doing more research into these types of opportunities. \n\nOverall, there are huge advantages to setting yourself up with multiple income streams. It generally makes you more money, spreads out your risk, and allows you to diversify.

I\u2019ve been able to fly to Canada to visit family multiple times for completely free, literally just by opening up a credit. I have enough points now to fly round trip first class to pretty much anywhere in the world, and stay a few nights at a world class resort, all for free, and this only took a few minutes of my time. Here\u2019s how. Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nOne thing most people don\u2019t know - you can actually profit, quite a lot, from credit card sign up bonuses. Lets face it, credit companies make money off people who carry balances and don\u2019t pay off their bill. The interest credit cards charge is astronomical and most people lose a ton of money every year to credit card interest payments. So to lure people in, credit cards will offer a sign up bonus. Usually if you spend a few thousand dollars in the first few months of opening a card, they\u2019ll give you a certain amount of points- this is called the minimum spend. Once you hit the minimum spend, those points are deposited to your account and can be redeemed for travel, hotel, or sometimes it\u2019s cash. \n\n1. Credit Cards make money off people who charge money on the account and don\u2019t pay it off in full. Do not be that guy (or girl) who keeps a balance on a credit card and pays interest. To do this effectively, charge the minimum spend needed to hit the bonus - with money you would have spent anyway - and pay it off in full.\n\n2. This is not for beginners. If you\u2019re just starting out, do not do this. This is meant for someone with already established credit history and a good credit score. \n\n3. . This is not for people who can\u2019t responsibly handle  credit card. Do not buy things you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily buy just because you have more credit. \n\n4. Credit Card bonuses can be redeemed for free travel, free rental cars, free hotels, cash back\u2026the possibilities are endless. It costs you nothing other than spending money you would already be spending, anyway. \n\n5. The best ways to use these points is by transferring the points to an airline and then booking directly with the airline. Usually booking plane tickets through the credit cards portal offers you a lower rate. \n\nUsing this strategy, and browsing reddit, I\u2019ve made thousands in points and gotten free airfare, travel, and hotels for free with almost no work. Do this correctly and you can continue building your credit while getting free stuff at the same time. \n\nFavorite website:\nwww.Reddit.com\/r\/churning\n\nMy favorite cards:\n1.

Just needs a few more exterior finishes and interior details cleaned up and it should be complete! Also, these are some creative ways to save some money throughout the process - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\n1. Shop around for major appliances and large purchase. I initially got a quote from Home Depot and then took it to Lowes to see if they would beat that price, and they did. $400 saved in less than an hour of work! Coming soon: Taking the Lowes quote back to home depot and seeing who goes down the most ;) \n\n2. Shop around Google to find the lowest prices. I checked out Window Coverings from Amazon and Ikea, but after some quick searching, I found SelectBlinds had the lowest price for custom made blinds. Easy choice and they were awesome - check them out here: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1wBZS7 - You can do this for just about any item you\u2019re buying.\n\n3. Do some of the minor work yourself. YouTube everything and you can get your own supplies for a fraction of the cost someone else will charge you for. I changed my own outlets pretty easily, as well as installing a lock - things that take under 10-15 minutes to do. Easy! \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-09-05T22:00:04Z","tags":["real estate investing","multi family investing","remodeling","renovation","how to renovate a property","how to remodel a property","how to remodel your home","how to save money on remodeling","grant cardone","tai lopez","real estate agent","realtor","how to buy a property","how to buy a house","how to sell a house","how to invest in real estate","how to invest your money","house remodeling","bathroom remodeling","kitchen remodel","remodel 2017"],"title":"Renovation Day 35: Home Depot vs Lowes price match!

And If you view money the same way, you can pretty much guarantee you\u2019ll never run out of money and you can make it generate cashflow to last a lifetime. Enjoy! Add me on Snapcaht\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nWithout the clickbait:\n\nHere\u2019s what it is. Let\u2019s say I have $10,000 in my account. I don\u2019t see that as just $10,000\u2026instead, I see that as $700 per year, for life. Or almost $60 per month that I can live off of for as long as I\u2019m alive. \n\nFor me, I might get about a 10% return by investing in real estate. Inflation eats away about 3% per year, leaving me with a net 7% return on my invested money. Meaning that for every $100 I invest in real estate, I\u2019ll make $7 per year in profit, while still having my original $100.  \n\nNow everything I do and think about is calculated in future monthly profits. So that $20,000 car is really worth $116 per month in profit. If I\u2019m making $50,000 per month, I don\u2019t see that as $50,000 per month\u2026that\u2019s $291 per month for life, PER MONTH. Basically one month of that will pay for a lifetime of my Toyota Prius lease payment without me ever having to come out of pocket.\n\nIt\u2019s even more impressive if you decide to reinvest your money. If you just decided to re-invest the 7% income that $10,000 generates, over 25 years that 10,000 will have grown to almost $55,000 at the same 7% return. \n\nSo now when I see something that costs $1000\u2026I think, it\u2019s that really worth $70 per year for life? Or is that really worth almost $5500 in future money? And usually for me the answer is no, I\u2019d rather the $70 per year and just continue growing that $70 per year until I can afford whatever costs $1000 without ever having to come out of pocket. My investments should be able to cover anything I want to buy, and at that point, you know you\u2019ve made it. \n\nNow that you see it, it\u2019s hard to view things the same way. I can look at almost anything and imagine what that would generate me monthly. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. \n\nBecause people always want to know what to invest in, I invest in rental property where a cash on cash return would generate about a 10% return, and I also invest in an SP500 index fund where it has historically returned about a 7.2% return adjusted for inflation. There are plenty of investments out there to chose from depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to make\u2026.

However, this isn\u2019t really the case. In fact, the multi-million dollar homes are often the easiest ones to work with, and this is why. Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan \n\nNow I\u2019m going to be making some broad generalizations and obviously there are going to be many exceptions to this. But this has been my experience time and time again in my market of Real Estate in Los Angeles. It won\u2019t always hold true for every buyer and every market is different, so keep this in mind. \n\nReason 1: From my experience, these buyers are extremely specific about what they want. They know exactly where they want to be, what they can spend, what style they want, and what finishes they like. It\u2019s usually not about showing them a hundred houses until they figure out what they like, but instead finding them the one specific property which matches their expectations. \n\nReason 2: I\u2019ve also noticed that the multi-million-dollar clients are extremely decisive. There is very little hesitation when they\u2019re willing to make a move. Because they often know what they want, when they see it, they go for it. This saves us a lot of time when the right deal comes up, we\u2019re ready to move on it. I can\u2019t tell you how many deals we\u2019ve lost because the client wanted to think about it and by the time they were ready to make an offer, we were competing with multiple other people who also wanted it. Being ready to strike quickly is what wins. \n\nReason 3: The multi-million dollar buyers are also usually very well educated in business, which usually translates into them knowing and understanding the markets of real estate. The buyers usually come in knowing about economics, the markets in general, the area in general, and are very well prepared. This makes it much easier for me when your buyer understands what they\u2019re doing and can prepare for it accordingly. \n\nReason 4: When a repair comes up, it\u2019s rarely detrimental to the deal. If there\u2019s a $100,000 repair in a $300,000 house, more than likely the deal is dead. If a $100,000 repair comes up on a $3,000,000 house, while it\u2019s never a pleasant experience, it\u2019s something where both parties can afford to make it work. \n\nReason 5: Financing is generally easier. The people that buy $2,000,000+ properties rarely ever have trouble financing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a deal fall out of escrow, ever, because the buyer couldn\u2019t qualify for their loan. In this price range, most people are overqualified for the homes they purchase. The other benefit in this price range is that I end up doing a ton of cash deals. This might be very market specific to LA, but it\u2019s not unheard of to have a cash offer in the $2,000,000 or higher price range. This makes the deal so much easier and faster. Buyers know they have a competitive edge being cash, and they take advantage of this. Plus you go into it without having a loan and appraisal contingency.\n\nSo to me, selling a $3,000,000 house is significantly easier than a $300,000 house. It\u2019s also a significantly larger commission, which would take 10x smaller deals to equal 1x larger one, hence it\u2019s generally a better use of time between comparing two deals, all other things being equal. \n\nThanks again for watching and i hope this video helps!\n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-10-20T22:00:03Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate agent","realtor coaching","real estate agent coaching","real estate agent mentor","real estate agent coach","real estate coach","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","how to be a real estate agent","how to invest","how to wholesale real estate","how to become a realtor","bryan casella","tai lopez","grant cardone","real estate exam","real estate agent career","real estate agent 101","real estate tips"],"title":"Why it\u2019s EASIER to sell a $3,000,000 house vs a $300,000 house","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YzkSNuicejk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YzkSNuicejk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YzkSNuicejk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YzkSNuicejk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YzkSNuicejk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"327","dislikeCount":"60","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3088","viewCount":"92613"}},{"id":"dwjsaKJl6v0","snippet":{"description":"With social media and branding taking over the internet, creating a personal brand around yourself and your interests is becoming more and more invaluable.

It just happens. After it happening again this year, I realized I was subconsciously investing EVERYTHING I had left over by the end of the year and starting the new year off close to $0. This keeps me extremely motivated to continue working hard, AND keeps my money invested and continuing to grow. Enjoy! \n\nFeel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nIt started in 2011 when I began buying real estate. I dumped pretty much every penny I had saved up into buying rental properties and renovating them to rent out. At the end of 2011, I had maybe $1000 to my name by the time I was done. I was literally counting on the rent from one of the places to be able to pay for the expenses I had coming up\u2026I also knew I had to work hard as a Real Estate agent to bump the savings up. \n\nSame happened in 2012. I continued buying rental properties - I even sold my Lotus Elise, which was my dream car at the time, to buy a triplex in San Bernardino. And just like the year prior, I was broke by the end of the year after renovations and other random expenses.\n\nWithout this being a conscious decision, almost every year since then I\u2019ve been broke by December 31st. I don\u2019t even think this was something I intentionally set out to do, it just happened. Some years I\u2019d max out retirement accounts, I\u2019d buy another house, something would be renovated, I\u2019d invest it in my real estate business with things that would bring me more future business. \n\nBut here\u2019s how I view it. Money by itself is useless unless it\u2019s invested and making you even more money. If you have $100,000 sitting in account, what is that good for? Unless you spend it on something useful, it just sits there. Sure, it\u2019s peace of mind in case of an emergency, I think it\u2019s important to still be smart about it and take the risks you are comfortable with, but beyond a certain point, money sitting is money losing interest to inflation. It\u2019s a massive opportunity cost with money that could be earning you more money, but isn\u2019t. So I make sure I invest AS MUCH AS I CAN every single year. I like to invest every last dollar I have left over, every single year. I want it all invested and stashed away. My goal in doing this is just to increase my passive income and grow my net worth. By doing this, and being left with almost nothing at the end of the year, it is the best motivation you\u2019ll ever have.\n\nWhen you have absolutely no other way out other than to make it work, you make it work.\n\nIt\u2019s very important I mention not to be too risky here - there\u2019s a fine balance between the risks your willing to take and what makes the most sense for your situation. For me, I can afford more risk because I have a lot to fall back on\u2026I can afford and feel comfortable with more risk than the person who\u2019s one paycheck away from being evicted and on the streets. That\u2019s the difference. Be smart about it and know yourself and what your situation is. Don\u2019t just invest it all if it means you can lose everything. \n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-10-16T22:30:02Z","tags":["real estate investing","how to invest in real estate","how to be a real estate agent","how to buy real estate","how to be a realtor","real estate investing 101","realtor coaching","real estate agent coaching","investing strategies","investment strategy","best investment strategy 2017","how to invest your money","best ways to invest your money","gary vee","tai lopez","grant cardone"],"title":"Why I'm ALWAYS broke by the end of the year\u2026$300,000 gone","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xaXy1fu_cvU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xaXy1fu_cvU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xaXy1fu_cvU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xaXy1fu_cvU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xaXy1fu_cvU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"878","dislikeCount":"75","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4472","viewCount":"80310"}},{"id":"i_q2Mig1cX8","snippet":{"description":"Part 1 here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N2k2LOlKpws&t=393s\n\nQuestions:\n0:34 -

I get comments of people posting their referral links to BitConnect in many of my videos. I see people promoting this on social media and how much money they\u2019re making daily. And I\u2019d hate for people to fall into this without knowing what they\u2019re getting into. Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nIf you\u2019re not aware, BitConnect is a cryptocurrency known as BCC. They guarantee that you can make some pretty large returns on your money. And of course, the more money you invest, the more you make. On their website, if you want to stake interest, your first six months will make you 10% per month. Invest in BitCoin lending, invest under $1000 and you can make up to 40% per month..bbut you also have to agree to lockup your investment for 299 days. But if you invest over $10,000 - you\u2019ll receive .25% daily + up to 40% per month from their trading bot, and you\u2019ll get your money back in 120 days. \n\nSo already this is sounding pretty crazy, but lets keep going. The real magic here is their referral system. You refer someone through your link and you immediately make 7% of their investment. If they refer someone, you make 3% of that persons investment. If they refer someone, you get 1% of their investment\u2026and you keep going. This is literally the definition of pyramid scheme.\n\nBasically you\u2019re getting one person funding the returns of another person, and you have to keep referring people to bring in the money to pay back these insane returns. This type of growth is absolutely unsustainable when enough people have joined, or enough people begin cashing out after their lock-up period, or Bitcoin recedes, or anything that would prevent the developer from being able to payout its users, or essentially whenever the developer maximizes profit, they can bounce and flee with a ton of money, leaving you hanging to dry. \n\nThe truth is there\u2019s absolutely no evidence that this coin is worth anything, you have no idea where your money goes, you have to lock up your money for a certain period of time, and they incentivize you to refer other people to increase your returns.  \n\nIt\u2019s pretty obvious here. It\u2019s unsustainable and at some point the gravy train can\u2019t continue. So for everyone doing this, just be careful - greed can end up costing you a lot of money. This might benefit those who get in early and who get out beforehand, but the majority of people will end up  losing. It\u2019s a game of risk and reward - so for me, if you see someone promoting this or you see an ad on my channel with this, know what you\u2019re getting into. Anytime something sounds too good to be true, it is. \n\nFor business inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-10-02T21:00:02Z","tags":["bitconnect","biconnect crypto","BCC","bitconnect ponzi scheme","bitconnect scam","is bitconnect a scam","bitconnect tutorial","bitconnect lending","bitconnect mining","bitconnect staking","cryptocurrency scam","crypto investor"],"title":"BitConnect is the $900,000,000 Crypto Ponzi Scheme","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eqi2zySlSRQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eqi2zySlSRQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eqi2zySlSRQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eqi2zySlSRQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eqi2zySlSRQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M24S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1256","dislikeCount":"578","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2605","viewCount":"99636"}},{"id":"QHPJMgcIaSw","snippet":{"description":"To get this out of the way, I\u2019m totally neutral about cryptocurrency - I\u2019ve been following Bitcoin for several years and have been watching most of the other coins closely over the last year or so. While it\u2019s easy to say \u201cin hindsight, I should have bought here and sold here,\u201d life doesn\u2019t work like that. Here\u2019s why I\u2019ve yet to invest in Cryptocurrency.  Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nWhile the blockchain technology behind it is extremely interesting and I think we\u2019ll have a bright future ahead of us in terms of what Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies can offer, right now I see the market as being driven by speculation instead of utility. This means that there\u2019s no \u201creal\u201d reason Bitcoin should be at $10,000 as there is that it should be at $5000, other than the promise of it being adopted on a much larger scale. \n\nI should also note that the more attention bitcoin gets, the higher the price, the more people want to get in, the more other people notice this and want to get in too, which creates a social network-like effect where the more people that adopt it, the more value it actually has, and the more the price will stabilize. \n\nSo in this regard, speculation in a cryptocurrency is necessary to growing it on a large scale. People have to take a risk on this and they\u2019re rewarded handsomely if it pays off. In order for this to stabilize to a point where speculation doesn\u2019t drive the market, it has to be accepted and seen as a normalized form a currency on a very large scale. The value of bitcoin is pretty much entirely dependent on how many people use it. \n\nBut this is where I see it getting complicated. While I think Bitcoin does have a strong intrinsic value and I\u2019d love to see this adopted on a larger scale, I wonder how much of bitcoin\u2019s value RIGHT NOW is speculative and how much of its value is \u201creal?\u201d And this is what I\u2019ve yet to figure out and where I get uneasy about investing. \n\nI know a lot of people compare bitcoin to gold, and in a sense this is a good point - older generations have seen gold as a safe store of value, just as our younger generation sees gold as being \u201cold\u201d and that Bitcoin is a better store of deflationary, decentralized currency. In a sense, they\u2019re right. And as more younger people begin adopting this, especially as these are the people already exposed to a digital word, I can see this continuing. But it should be noted that when the dollar went off the gold standard in 1979, Gold Prices spiked significantly before settling down several years later and stabilized. Could we be in the same \u201crun up\u201d like gold saw, if the two are compared to one another? \n\nIt\u2019s easy to look back and see what I should\u2019ve done, but I also feel just as much that things could have turned out very differently.

Feel free to add me on Snapchat and Instagram: GPStephan\n\nHow I make $6470 per month:\nOwning five rental properties - $4650\/month\nPaying down mortgages - $1600\/month in equity\nIndex Fund VFIAX - $200\/month\nAlly Bank Savings Account - $20\/month\n\nNote: The rental properties aren\u2019t 100% passive..it still requires some time accounting income and expenses\u2026 but seriously, I have everyone on staff to handle things as they come up. Maybe one hour of work per month, sometimes two. \n\nI essentially keep my spending at the level I make from the rental properties so that everything else I earn from real estate can be re-invested to make more money. That way I can ramp up my investments and keep the portfolio growing. \n\nSome other great ways of earning passive income include:\n\nInvesting in Real Estate - Rental Properties \n\nInvesting in the stock market - I'm a fan of Vanguard Index Funds\n\nOwning intellectual property such as ebooks, websites, online marketing...and maybe even YouTube ;)\n\nAmazon FBA, Affiliate Marketing, Drop Shipping can be good choices. \n\nThrough semi-absentee owned businesses such as Laundromats, Self Storage Centers, Car Washes, etc. \n\nOwning your own business and hiring out people to manage the day-to-day operations\n\nPeer to Peer lending - www.Prosper.com, www.LendingClub.com, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019ve actually read this far, I hope you appreciate the transparency - I\u2019m doing these videos as an example of what\u2019s possible and to plant the seed why passive income and investing is absolutely important. \n\nThanks again for watching!

Enjoy! Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nStep 1: Start by reverse engineering it. Determine what type of lifestyle you want and get very specific about it. How much money do you need? What do you want to achieve? The car, house, trips, vacations, real estate you want to own, etc. How much will that cost you and how much will you need to make to pay for those things?\n\nStep 2: How much are you willing to risk and how soon do you want this to happen? The sooner you want it, generally the more risk you\u2019ll need to take. Consider if you\u2019re willing to take those risks and if it\u2019s worth it to you.\n\nStep 3: How many hours are you willing to work? If you\u2019re the type that loves to work, then your ideal career will be much different than someone who follows the 4 hour work week and wants to do as little as possible. Otherwise, investing and creative passive income sources over a long period of time might be better. \n\nStep 4: What are you willing to give up to make it a reality? Generally there will be things to give up along the way and you\u2019ll have to determine what\u2019s worth it to you and what you\u2019re not okay giving up. \n\nIt\u2019s all about working backwards from your end goal and finding something that aligns with who you are. Ideally, though, you should do something that you enjoy.

Enjoy! Feel free to add me on Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nComica Microphone: http:\/\/amzn.to\/2hup5pJ\n\nI first start by figuring out what type of topic I want to talk about. I try to mix my videos up so it\u2019s not repetitive, and I switch up topics as often as I can to keep it fresh. \n\nOnce I pick a topic I want to talk about, I pick what to wear. Usually I\u2019ll wear something that I think matches well with the subject of the video. \n\nFrom there, I\u2019ll write out bullet points of what I want to say and in what order. This keeps me from getting side tracked, off topic, or jumping from subject to subject. Like in my last video about investing and remodeling real estate, I tried to make it flow in an order where one topic led to another. \n\nThen, I film and hopefully the sound works ;)\n\nFrom there, I\u2019ll spend hours editing - this is the part that takes the longest. I try to cut anything out that doesn\u2019t need to be in the video or is repetitive. I try to keep it as short and condensed as possible, rather than just keep a long video. I\u2019ll edit it over 2 days, and sometimes re-watch it the next day in case I missed anything. \n\nAfter this, I usually mess around with the thumbnail for about 20 minutes.

This is how I pick an area, how I find a property, what renovations I decide to do, and everything in between. I hope you enjoy! Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nQuick numbers:\nBought at $585,000\nSpent $65,000 on renovations\nTotal cost: $650,000\nTotal market value: $800,000\nTotal profit of equity: $150,000\n\nI primarily focus on finding areas which I see as \u201cup-and-coming.\u201d They\u2019re typically located next to other areas which have recently seen a large price increase. From my perspective, people get out priced in an adjacent neighborhood and slowly migrate further out. So I like these areas that are just on the outskirts of another location which saw a huge growth of demand, thereby driving up prices. As businesses and people continue to move outwards, prices tend to increase.\n\nI also check daily for new properties that come on the market. I like to focus on homes that need as much remodeling as possible - preferably cosmetic remodeling, such as floors, paint, kitchen, bathroom, and landscape. These are simple and non time-consuming which give you a quicker turn-around time to finish the project. \n\nIt\u2019s important to move quickly when you find a good deal. Other people are out there trying to find the same thing, so when you find something, act on it. Get it locked in contract asap. Otherwise you might be left in a multiple counter offer, competing at top dollar to buy the property. \n\nWhen bought and done correctly, you will be left with extra equity which you can then refinance, pull out your money, and then repeat the process. \n\nThank you so much for watching! \n\nFor business or one-on-one consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nMy most used Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-11-08T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to flip real estate","how to wholesale real estate","how to invest in real estate","real estate market","how to make money in real estate","how to make a million dollars","how i became a millionaire","how to invest in stocks","how to invest","real estate agent mentor","tai lopez","grant cardone","gary vee","how to make money","investing","real estate"],"title":"How I made $150,000 in 4 months just by buying and remodeling this property (step by step)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bx1EUPRh7hU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bx1EUPRh7hU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bx1EUPRh7hU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bx1EUPRh7hU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bx1EUPRh7hU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"921","dislikeCount":"118","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6043","viewCount":"179913"}},{"id":"L2BYekiQRd4","snippet":{"description":"These are the 6 things I wish I had known when I was a lot younger - I hope you enjoy and thanks for watching! Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThanks to SelectRugs.com for the amazing rug! Definitely check them out! \n\n1. I\u2019d be less concerned about what other people thought of me. Trying to be cool, trying to fit in, trying to always say the right thing, or wear the right clothes\u2026none of it ever mattered. No one cared. Everything was in my imagination because I was too self conscious to believe that I could just be myself without trying to fit in. Everyone is too focused on themselves to give any attention to you. So go ahead and just be you\u2026if anything, people just respect that more. Very few people out there can truly be themselves, it takes a lot of inner confidence and security to know that you can be yourself. So go ahead, just be you and it\u2019ll turn out better than you ever expected.\n\n2. The next thing I\u2019d tell myself is not to compare myself with others. On one hand you could look up to someone super successful and admire them, and use that as motivation and inspiration to push yourself further. On the other hand, comparing yourself to someone who has more money, is better looking, has more than you, is further ahead than you, and feeling jealous or that it\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d because of that\u2026is a waste of mental energy. We\u2019re all different, travel different paths, and it\u2019s impossible to compare yourself with someone else. Life isn\u2019t a race, it\u2019s a journey. And it\u2019s the journey that makes it beautiful, not the finish line. \n\n3. There\u2019s more than just someone\u2019s image, too. You have no idea what people are secretly going through. The successful-looking guy could be absolutely empty inside. Or the non-assuming dude in the beat up Honda could be the happiest, more secretly baller player ever - your interpretation of these things isn\u2019t always correct, so best to always go into it knowing that what you see is just what you see - it\u2019s surface level.\n\n4. The next thing, and the biggest thing, is that i\u2019d like to remind myself that no one knows what they\u2019re actually doing. Everyone is just as lost as each other but will rarely ever admit it. I\u2019m still trying to figure things out, i really have no idea what I\u2019m doing half the time, I still doubt what I\u2019m doing is working or good enough, and I think that\u2019s totally normal. It doesn\u2019t make you weird, it doesn\u2019t make you bad, it just means you\u2019re like every other person who\u2019s living life. We\u2019re all just as clueless and winging it. \n\n5. Finally, you never regret taking action - you only regret what you didn\u2019t do. So go and do those things, you won\u2019t regret it. \n\n6. Don\u2019t worry about things that haven\u2019t happened yet. I\u2019m a worrier. It\u2019s a waste of energy. Spend your time doing this to proactively improve your life, not playing mental defense. \n\nUnderstanding this really helps put it in perspective.

So this is my perspective from both a real estate agent and investor. Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe way I see it:\nPeople have too much equity in their homes to let them go into foreclosure. Banks are strict about who they\u2019re lending to, and want people with higher down payments and strong income. In order to qualify, a buyer must pass a rigorous approval process reviewing their financials, income, credit score and history, assets, and debt. They do not let just anyone buy a home now. I don\u2019t see anything that leads me to think we\u2019re in a bubble.\n\nIn addition to this, we have low interest rates which are holding prices fairly steady. If this climb too fast, yes, it could have a short term impact on pricing - but there\u2019s no way they\u2019d raise interest rates that quickly to disrupt housing prices. It\u2019ll be done slow and steady over many, many years. \n\nRealistically, we\u2019ll see many more homes in construction coming on that market. This will lead to an over supply of homes which means buyers will have more leverage and more to chose from. This won\u2019t cause housing to crash, but it could take longer for a seller to sell a house because they\u2019re facing more competition. \n\nThis, combined with slowly rising interest rates, I believe that housing is safe and won\u2019t see any type of large price drop. Realistically, there won\u2019t be any price drop, but we won\u2019t be seeing huge appreciation like we were over the last 7 years - which is not sustainable to begin with. I think we\u2019ll enter a period where normal, slow appreciation is the norm as more homes come on the market and interest rates slowly get higher. No reason to panic and nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n*Just my pure opinion, of course. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions. This is only from my perspective. \n\nThanks so much for watching! \n\nFor business or consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2017-11-02T22:00:02Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate agent","realtor coaching","real estate mentor","real estate agent mentor","real estate market","real estate agent coach","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","how to be a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to save money","how i became a millionaire","grant cardone","tai lopez","gary vee","how to buy real estate","real estate","investing"],"title":"To everyone wondering \u201cWhen the Real Estate market will crash??\u201d - my prediction","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKfuuI5bVZA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKfuuI5bVZA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKfuuI5bVZA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKfuuI5bVZA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fKfuuI5bVZA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"575","dislikeCount":"171","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1504","viewCount":"71801"}},{"id":"KG1UoQHfcfg","snippet":{"description":"These are my goals for 2018 and how I recommend setting and planning your goals going forward to the new year. Enjoy! Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nYou need a goal if you want to achieve something. It isn\u2019t going to happen out of nowhere. It isn\u2019t just going to fall in your lap. You need to want something, and you need to have a REASON to want it. You can\u2019t just aimlessly go around expecting things to happen without a purpose. This is why it\u2019s so important to have a set a goal for yourself, something you can measure.\n\nWhen you make a goal and you put it out there, you subconsciously hold yourself responsible to that goal. By writing it down and speaking it, you\u2019re setting the motions in place to actually make it a reality. \n\nHaving a REASON behind something really helps solidify it into having a purpose. Without a purpose and emotion behind it, having a goal is useless. You need to have a reason WHY you want something. Otherwise it\u2019s just a material thing that\u2019s easy to let go. So with your goals, really think about WHY you want them and why it\u2019s important to you. This will help make it much more \u201creal.\u201d \n\nMy realization this year is that I\u2019ve set my goals too low and I\u2019ve been holding myself back for many, many years. Took a lot to recognize that. I\u2019ve always set these goals that were realistic that I felt I\u2019d be able to hit if I pushed myself. And every single year I\u2019ve exceeded every single goal I\u2019ve set. But these were never crazy goals\u2026And then I realized I was the one limiting myself to what I could accomplish. Even though I thought I had gotten rid of my all of my limiting beliefs, deep down I didn\u2019t think I could do better than a certain amount. And deep down I didn\u2019t want to not hit a goal I\u2019ve set for myself and let myself down. So this year, I\u2019m trying something different. I\u2019m going to go much, much higher with my goals because I\u2019ve underestimated myself every single year. And I suggest you do the same. \n\nHere are my 2018 goals: \nHave my first seven-figure earning year\u2026 $1,000,000\nIncrease my passive rental income to $10,000 per month by the end of 2018. \nTo increase my passive rental income, that requires me to buy and renovate another property in 2018. So that\u2019s also on the list. \n\nIn terms of YouTube, I\u2019d like to reach 500,000 subscribers and average 2 million views per month. \nReaching $100,000 in ad revenue at that point would also be another goal.\n\nI\u2019d also like to upgrade the Lotus this year, either a Lamborghini Superlaggera or Manual Ferrari F430. But the car is undecided at this point.\n\nIn terms of non materialistic goals, \nI\u2019d like to setup another reef tank this year. \nI\u2019d also like to get my drums set up again.\nI\u2019d also like to do at least 10 speaking engagements in 2018.\n\nI\u2019d also like to say yes more often. I\u2019ve been pretty complacent and sometimes become a bit too much of a homebody who doesn\u2019t go out much, so I\u2019d like to put myself out there more often than I have been. \n\nHit the Realtor top 30 Under 30 award for 2018 :)\n\nI have a few other personal ones that I\u2019d just prefer not to share with the world, but rest assured I\u2019ve written them down. \n\nA lot of this is just to show that I\u2019ve been selling myself short way too many years and wanting to try to break out of the comfort zone. So I\u2019m setting some loftier goals to see if this can work :)\n\nIf you want to add on to this, feel free to upload a video and call it \u201c2018 Graham Stephan Goal Challenge\u201d and I\u2019ll subscribe to everyone who posts a video with their goals! \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nGet $10 by signing up on Coinbase after your first $100 purchase: https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/5a20f244e07edf019d1ce550\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-31T18:00:01Z","tags":["How to set goals 2018","how to set goals","real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to invest","how to invest your money","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","how to make a million dollars","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","real estate 101","how to make money in stocks","stock market 101","how to invest in stocks","gary vee","tai lopez","grant cardone"],"title":"How to Set Goals: My goals for 2018 ($1 Million in income)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KG1UoQHfcfg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KG1UoQHfcfg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KG1UoQHfcfg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/KG1UoQHfcfg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M41S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"562","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1235","viewCount":"23954"}},{"id":"hS8lIrzEwv0","snippet":{"description":"Here is my screening process when looking for a tenant. As a landlord and Realtor, I have leased HUNDREDS of places - these are the red flags I've noticed and how I now go about selecting the best tenants. Enjoy! Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\n1 .Bad Credit Score. This is something I can sometimes let slide depending on the situation, but generally this is a red flag. A credit report and score shows you how responsible your tenant is paying their bills and loans. Often times if you see they\u2019re behind on car payments, medical bills, have liens or judgements against them\u2026chances are, they\u2019re not going to be an ideal tenant. Now every situation is different and each case is treated individually. But generally speaking, if they\u2019re consistently late on their bills, have large amounts in collections, and otherwise they don\u2019t care - pass. \n\n2.The next red flag is when the tenant has a lot of unreported income. First of all, regular cash deposits are usually an immediate red flag that something is sketchy, and the type of person who does this for the purposes of avoiding the IRS is already not someone I want to associate myself with. But generally with cash income comes infrequent income, and this is the type of tenant who might not have rent every month. Usually this type of tenant is doing something sketchy, it might not be sustainable, and it\u2019ll be inconsistent. They could also be trying to hide from collections by keeping what they need to in cash, so I suggest looking closely at avoiding this person.\n\n3. The next one is wanting to move in ASAP. Although this isn\u2019t always a red flag, this is something I\u2019m extremely weary about. This is something I take on a case-by-case basis. Some times the tenant just didn\u2019t have time to find a place and their lease is up\u2026that\u2019s cool if you can verify it. Other tenants just want to get the house hunt out of the way by locking something down ASAP and then having an overlap, that\u2019s cool to. But there are other tenants who are in the process of being evicted or forced out of their last home and just need somewhere to move immediately and use this as a negotiating point for landlords. Be weary of someone willing to move in immediately, it could be fine or it could be a way for a tenant to lock something down before they\u2019re evicted. Find out why they\u2019re moving and if you trust that\u2019s the truth. \n\n4.The next is not providing their previous landlord\u2019s information or lying on their application. Many tenants refuse to put their landlords information on their applications. Many times they\u2019ll have an excuse like they aren\u2019t on good terms, its a he said she said story, or they don\u2019t want to tell their landlord that they\u2019re moving\u2026in any event, it\u2019s an immediate red flag and seems sketchy to me. If they\u2019re not providing their landlords information, they\u2019re withholding information from you to make an informed decision about this tenant. Many tenants will also lie on their applications and put someone else\u2019s number who will pretend to be the owner. If this happens, immediately cut them off\u2026this happens way more than you\u2019d think. \n\n5.Doesn\u2019t show u on time or doesn\u2019t pay on time. Hopefully this happens BEFORE you sign a lease with them. If the tenant doesn\u2019t show up on time for an appointment, this is something you should consider. Generally the people who don\u2019t show up on time will not be the type to pay on time. Make it a priority for the tenant to pay on time. Another one is if the tenant doesn\u2019t pay their deposit or first months rent on time\u2026if they make an excuse early on, take this as a sign that they aren\u2019t the right tenant for you. \n\n6.Trust your gut - if you feel uneasy about someone, go with your intuition. I really believe that your intuition will pick up things that a logical approach will not\u2026if you feel uneasy about a tenant, trust it.

Enjoy! Feel free to add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nOwning real estate is much more than just owning a cash producing property that provides monthly profits, what makes it really unique against almost every other investment is the tax write offs associated with it. In real estate, a return could be calculated in so many different ways besides \u201cI get $1000 per month in rent.\u201d What makes real estate really special is that you could often make money every month, but on paper show a loss\u2026and this cancels out your tax obligation. Here are some of the tax write offs that make real estate a phenomenal investment. \n\n1. Mortgage interest write off - On an investment property, the interest that you pay on your mortgage is a write off against your rental income. On a primary residence, the mortgage interest on the first $750,000 could also be a write off, potentially saving thousands in owed taxes.\n\n\n2. Property taxes - This is another deduction you can write off against your rental and personal income. As a primary residence, you\u2019re allowed to deduct the first $10,000 of your property tax against your personal income As an investment property, you can still deduct 100% of your property taxes against your rental income.\n\n3. Depreciation - This is what often leads you to be positive in your bank account each month, but on paper you could show a loss, lowering the amount you\u2019d pay taxes on. With rental property, you\u2019re allowed to depreciate the asset over a certain period of time. Cost segregation analysis can sometimes speed this dramatically. However, keep in mind that because you\u2019re depreciating a property, eventually the tax you depreciate will need to be paid at the time of sale if you DON\u2019T 1031 it, so it\u2019s not a tax avoidance entirely, but this works great if you plan to keep the home as a rental or eventually do a 1031 exchange later on. \n\n4. 1031 exchange. This is a very popular real estate tax benefit that almost every real estate investor uses. This means that you can sell your property and \u201cExchange\u201d it for a like property of similar or greater value without paying taxes at the time of the same sale. This is how many people can buy and sell millions without ever paying capital gains taxes, as long as they don\u2019t sell and continue 1031 exchanging properties. \n\n5. Capital gains exclusion on a primary residence: As long as you\u2019ve lived in the home for 2 of the last 5 years, you can sell a your primary residence up to $250,000 HIGHER than you bought it for if you\u2019re single, or $500,000 if you\u2019re married, without owning capital gains tax. \n\n6. Cash out refinance - When used against a rental property, you can refinance the extra equity in the property and pull out the profits tax free. Even though this is technically a loan you have to pay back, you\u2019re borrowing from the existing equity and using that money without paying taxes on the money that hit your account. This gets a little more complicated as a primary residence, but on a rental, this is a huge advantage because the new mortgage you pay on the amount pulled out counts against your rental income\u2026so you can use this money for pretty much whatever you want, hopefully just to re-invest. \n\n7. Finally, rental property income is not taxed as self employment income, which carries a 15.3% self employment tax (not fun).  But keep in mind this is also dependent on how you hold the property and specific ways you\u2019re treating your income.\n\nDisclosure: I am not a tax consultant or CPA. These are just a few tax advantages I have used myself and I have simplified these significantly for purposes of explaining them on YouTube. Check with your own accountant or CPA because every situation is going to be unique. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-22T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to invest","how to invest your money","how to make a million dollars","real estate tax write offs","how i became a millionaire","how to invest in real estate","real estate investment","how to invest in stocks","real estate 101","stock market 101","how to make money in real estate","how to make money in stocks","grant cardone","tai lopez","gary vee","how to wholesale"],"title":"The 7 BEST Tax Write-Offs when Investing in Real Estate!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sLaw91Baay0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sLaw91Baay0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sLaw91Baay0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sLaw91Baay0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sLaw91Baay0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M18S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"332","dislikeCount":"57","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4110","viewCount":"101333"}},{"id":"SloJvOLRkhI","snippet":{"description":"Here's my first experience picking a tenant when I first began investing in real estate.

Here\u2019s how you can use that to your advantage. Enjoy! Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nWhat I\u2019ve found is that it really helps to match whatever it is that you do. It helps to be congruent with it. If something doesn\u2019t add up between how you present yourself and what you do, people get suspicious. People see the disconnect and immediately hesitate, because they feel you\u2019re not living up to what you\u2019re presenting. You\u2019re selling a $10,000 program on making millions of dollars? You bet you can\u2019t show yourself driving around a 1989 Honda Accord while living in a studio apartment in Lancaster. People like to see that you live what you preach. \n\nEven how you dress can make an impact. Again, designer clothes don\u2019t matter - but instead of wearing something oversized that doesn\u2019t fit, where people may make quick judgements that you\u2019re unorganized and don\u2019t pay attention to detail, make sure to wear clothes that fit your physique, are clean, and ironed. That\u2019s it. \n\nThe details matter - I\u2019ve found socks are an easy detail that many people notice and most people miss. Seriously, a good pair of colorful socks go a long way. Even a clean haircut and shave makes a huge difference. Some other things you can do - clip your nails, brush your teeth, wear cologne. Little things that people notice that don\u2019t cost much, if anything. \n\nBut it\u2019s not entirely physical . The thing is, the other half is attitude. It\u2019s believing what you do. You do emulate what you\u2019re doing?\n\nFigure out what you want and then tailor your image to become what you want to be. Dress for success. And again, it doesn\u2019t need to be too superficial. Focus on what you have control over - how you dress, good hygiene, and how to present yourself, and creating the image that matches the person. Work on speaking if it\u2019s holding you back, work on being more assertive if you\u2019re not getting what you want, it\u2019s about constantly improving yourself and slowly becoming the person you\u2019ve always envisioned yourself being. And realize that image sometimes plays a role in this and use that to your advantage.  \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-18T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to invest","how to invest your money","how to make a million dollars","how to become a millionaire","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","stock market 101","real estate 101","how to make money in real estate","how to make money in stocks","tai lopez","grant cardone","gary vee","how to buy rental property"],"title":"How your image can MAKE or BREAK you","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMm0DygZeTU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMm0DygZeTU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMm0DygZeTU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMm0DygZeTU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gMm0DygZeTU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"386","dislikeCount":"27","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2026","viewCount":"41447"}},{"id":"mnXnVJEpcyw","snippet":{"description":"You\u2019ve asked (and asked, and asked), and I\u2019ll deliver - here\u2019s a step by step guide of how I purchase Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum using Coinbase and GDax. Thanks for watching! Coinbase link: https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/5a20f244e07edf019d1ce550 (You get $10, I get $10 after your first $100 purchase - totally up to you if you use it or not)\n\nDisclosure - I\u2019m showing you exactly what I did, and by no means am I endorsing you buy Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. I\u2019m treating this money I use as my gambling money, it\u2019s not going to make a big difference to me if it goes up 10x or falls 90%. It\u2019s extremely volatile, extremely risky, and at this point, I believe the market is strongly driven by speculation. Do this with good intentions and this is not a get rich quick tactic. Make sure this is money you can afford to risk, and by no means should bitcoin replace a historically proven investment strategy. Do your own research! However, if you\u2019re like me and want to play around with it and learn about it firsthand with money you can afford to lose\u2026here you you.\n\nFirst, I made a Coinbase Account.\n\nAs an err of caution, always make sure to use google authenticator. I\u2019m overly cautious and have my cellphone provider require a password + last 4 of my social to get access my number. I also have a second cell phone and number, not linked to me, to use for all of my accounts with a google authenticator app. So make sure you set yourself up where no one can gain access to your account without your permission. \n\nCoinbase is an easy simple to use website, but the fees or wait times tend to be out of control. For this reason, I recommend using either a bank transfer (can take 5-10 days, however) or a wire transfer. However, I\u2019ve preferred to skip coinable altogether and instead use GDax with my Coinbase account. It looks a little more complicated than a coinbase account, but it\u2019s very easy to learn in a few minutes. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve created your GDax account and gone through their verification, you can use the steps outlined in the video to wire\/bank transfer your money and place your order. I prefer limit orders because they\u2019re free and work great if you have the patience to watch the market or wait until your order is filled. \n\nFinally, once your order is filled, I wouldn\u2019t recommend you just keep your Bitcoin on GDax or Coinbase because sites like this have been hacked before. Instead, you can look into a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger Nano S. This way your currency won\u2019t be at the mercy of their servers. Please do your own research on cryptocurrency security to find what\u2019s right for you. \n\nThanks so much for watching! \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-17T23:30:01Z","tags":["how to buy bitcoin","how to buy ethereum","how to buy litecoin","how to use coinbase","how to use gdax","how to buy bitcoins","how to buy bitcoins with credit card","how to buy bitcoin on coinbase","how to buy bitcoin on gdax","how to buy bitcoin with debit card","bitcoin explained","coinbase tutorial","gdax tutorial","gdax trading","gdax limit order","gdax fees","coinbase fees","gdax no fees","cryptocurrency","how to buy cryptocurrency","how to buy cryptocurrency beginners","how to buy crypto"],"title":"HOW TO BUY: Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum (Step by Step)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mnXnVJEpcyw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mnXnVJEpcyw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mnXnVJEpcyw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mnXnVJEpcyw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mnXnVJEpcyw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M58S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"393","dislikeCount":"73","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"963","viewCount":"30051"}},{"id":"Bw5y_EWblCI","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s how to basically earn tax free money in real estate.

The home is now worth $170,000. This means that you\u2019ve just gained $50,000 of EQUITY in the home\u2026your $120,000 price + $50,000 gained = $170,000 value. What is equity? Just think of it like an unrealized gain, like if you hold a stock and it goes from $100 to $150\u2026that extra $50 is an unrealized profit until you sell it\u2026what is unrealized? That means you haven\u2019t sold yet and are still holding on to the asset. \n\u00a0\u00a0\nSince you now have an UNREALIZED gain in real estate and the home is worth MORE than you bought it for, you\u2019re able to borrow against that gain. So in this case of $50,000\u2026you\u2019re able to get a LOAN against your $50,000 profit, using that equity as collateral. Now the way taxes work is that you\u2019re only taxed when you SELL the property\u2026just the same as stocks or cryptocurrency, you\u2019re taxed at the time of selling and then those are REALIZED profits. So if you had a $50,000 GAIN when you sold the property, you\u2019d then have to pay taxes on that income\u2026but if you get a LOAN, even if you wind up with money back in your pocket, the IRS treats that as just a shift in assets. Because you just received a loan, you never \u201crealized\u201d your profits by selling.\n\nBecause there was only a shift in assets and debts and not a change in the REALIZED net worth when you sell, the IRS does not consider the pulled-out cash income. When you receive cash out in a refinance, the IRS recognizes that you have to pay it back, and so you really haven't \u201cmade\u201d\u00a0\u00a0any income.\u00a0\n\nThe thing is, since this is a loan, you still have to pay it back over the term of your loan. And this frees up the money you would have tied up in a property, and opens it up to be reinvested at a higher rate or into something else. The purpose of doing this should be to buy more investments that produce a HIGHER return than what you\u2019re paying out in interest..and the refinanced property should generate the income to support the new mortgage. If this doesn\u2019t happen, it begins getting risky\u2026you shouldn\u2019t over leverage yourself to a point where you owe more than you can handle, BUT, if used correctly, you can leverage yourself a lot of extra money to invest with. \n\nThis is what\u2019s known as a cash-out refinance and how you can use your equity in a property for tax free money. This method of real estate investing is also known as the BRRRR method of real estate investing. Buy. Rehab. Rent. Refinance. Repeat.\n\nIt\u2019s a way of \u201ccashing out\u201d without actually cashing out\u2026then using those proceeds to continue investing in more properties. Each property generates equity, each time you use that equity to buy another, which continues the process. I like this method because it\u2019s a long term approach that grows a lot over time. But like I said, I\u2019ll get into this in another video in more detail.

After years of waiting, I put some money in Bitcoin and Litecoin the other day\u2026here\u2019s why and my thoughts on cryptocurrency values going forward. Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nCoinbase Referral Link: https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/5a20f244e07edf019d1ce550\n(You get $10, I get $10 when you buy $100+ of currency)\n\nHere\u2019s why I finally bought in and my thoughts going forward. When it came down to it, I just thought\u2026why not. Let\u2019s try this out. I wanted to get a firsthand experience of buying, selling, and holding cryptocurrency - just like in real estate investing, it\u2019s one thing to have a textbook knowledge of it. You could point out every flaw, every investor psychology, everything that you \u201cshould\u201d do\u2026but until you actually do it, you don\u2019t understand the full context behind it.\n\nYou might initially think that I\u2019m flip flopping on my outlook and just following the herd and FOMO\u2019ing in as a sheep, but my reasoning behind investing isn\u2019t to make mad profit\u2026although that would be nice. Instead, I\u2019m using this as a learning experience to cryptocurrency in general. I\u2019m pretty much just paying for an education in cryptocurrency and diving into what people are going through firsthand without the expectation of making a ton of money. \n\nAnd it\u2019s fun. I understand it. I\u2019ve been up until 3am watching charts, reading forums, talking to you guys on snap\/insagram\u2026it\u2019s a fun community of people with a similar interest and goal. I can see why the majority of people won\u2019t be doing this until cryptocurrency gets much larger and more stable, and this leaves a lot of room for potential. \n\nBut there\u2019s still a significant commonality I see between myself and many of the other more conservative investors out there who still haven\u2019t invested and don\u2019t plan on it. And that\u2019s VALUE investing. In real estate, this takes into account current demand, how limited is inventory, what\u2019s the cost to replicate this, what rent can I charge, and this has a direct utility - people LIVE in it. Just like investing in a company - what do they PRODUCE? What are their earnings? And how well are they valued?\n\nThis is the biggest difference I\u2019m seeing. Even though I\u2019m investing in cryptocurrency, I STILL can\u2019t justify the value. I can\u2019t see why Bitcoin is coming in on $20,000\u2026nearly DOUBLE from what it was recently\u2026as it is at $7000. Or $13k. Right now, the value is whatever we think it is rather than on the fundamentals. I understand the value from a psychological standpoint - there are MANY psychological price barriers when it comes to cryptocurrency, and I get the future aspirations of it becoming more and more mainstream, but literally everything I\u2019m seeing is speculation. It\u2019s investing with the expectation that it\u2019ll be worth more in the future. \n\nNow, we can compare Bitcoin to every other market and see \u201cin relation to this, it\u2019s undervalued.\u201d But right NOW I can\u2019t see the functionality justifying a 100% price increase in a few weeks\u2026functionality and use of bitcoin didn\u2019t just go up nearly 100% in 2 weeks, but media attention and excitement of future profits did. \n\nThis isn\u2019t even to say that bitcoin is the best coin\u2026honestly, so many other coins have way more potential. But Bitcoin remains the top dog for its mainstream popularity, even though I believe in other cryptocurrencies way more. \n\nBut, I can\u2019t see any type of fundamentals justifying these prices right now\u2026and now I can say that while having money in it. And maybe one day, but in order for this to sustain itself, we either need way more mainstream adoption or for people to continue buying it higher and higher with the expectation that someone else will continue buying higher. \n\nSo my recommendation? Invest what you can afford to lose. I invested an amount where it won\u2019t make a difference to me if it drops significantly. I\u2019ll more than likely continue playing around with crypto and HODLing, because I have a pretty positive outlook on cryptocurrency in general, but I\u2019m only buying in as fun play money to learn more about it. \n\nOh and because every video I make about not buying, it goes up 100%+ or more\u2026expect that once I post this about BUYING, it\u2019ll drop a ton. Just my luck.\n\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-13T00:00:01Z","tags":["bitcoin","bitcoin price","bitcoin explained","bitcoin 101","bitcoin mining","bitcoin 2017","bitcoin 2018","bitcoin investment 2017","bitcoin investment 2018","bitcoin investment strategy","bitcoin news","cryptocurrency explained","cryptocurrency","cryptocurrency news","bitcoin all time high","bitconnect","bitcoin correction","bitcoin prediction","cryptocurrency prediction","investing in cryptocurrencies","litecoin","ethereum","altcoins","bitcoin investments","crypto trading"],"title":"Bitcoin Nears $17K: Why I FINALLY invested in Cryptocurrency (What happened?!)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1CrKQVTbep0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1CrKQVTbep0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1CrKQVTbep0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1CrKQVTbep0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1CrKQVTbep0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1506","dislikeCount":"239","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2740","viewCount":"89580"}},{"id":"U3E5l8JBjt4","snippet":{"description":"These are some random clips from an interview with real estate investor Matt McKeever that I felt deserved their own video.

Enjoy! Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nYou have two people starting out at 18 years old. One decides to be a plumber, one decides to be a doctor. Who will have a higher net worth, all things considered?\n\nNow to do this, for congruency, I\u2019m considering that both professions end up saving 50% of their paycheck and invest it at an 8% return. I\u2019m also considering that each salary increases over time with experience and inflation. \n\nLet\u2019s consider the plumber first. The plumber starts working at 18 years old at $12 per hour as an apprentice. Because the plumber never went to college, the plumber has zero student debt and can get right to making money and investing. We can also assume a 50 hour work week, meaning at the beginning, the plumber is likely pulling in about $2400 per month before taxes, $2000 per month after taxes, and can invest $1000 per month. \n\nAfter 4 years, we\u2019ll assume the plumber is now making $5,000 per month before taxes, $4000 after taxes, and can invest $2000 per month. After 10 years, we\u2019ll assume the plumber is making $100,000 per year before taxes as an experienced full time plumber, $70,000 after taxes, and can save $3000 per month\n\nAt the age of 22, our plumber should be worth nearly $60,000 - investing $12,000 per year for 4 years. \nAt the age of 28, our plumber should be worth nearly $290,000 - this is the base $60,000 + $2000 per month, 8% interest, over an additional 6 more years. \nAt the age of 50, our plumber should be worth almost $3,800,000 - his base amount of $290,000 + $3000 per month invested over 22 years at the same 8% return. \nSo our 18-year old plumber became a 50-year-old with $3,800,000 net worth. \n\nLet\u2019s compare this to our doctor. The big thing here is that the doctor starts investing and earning later much later in life. \n\nWe\u2019re going to assume 4 years of undergraduate education at $20,000 per year and that any income goes towards paying down debts before investing. After 4 years of undergraduate college, our doctor will be negative -$80,000 in education costs. After those 4 years, the doctor will be up against 4 additional years of medical school - let\u2019s assume this is $50,000 per year. At the end of undergraduate and medical school, our doctor will be about $280,000 in debt - without earning or investing a single dime. I\u2019m leaving out cost of living and interest just out of simplicity. \n\nAfter 8 years of school, the doctor will then do 3-5 years of residency  - so let\u2019s assume 4 years, at a $60,000 per year salary. Remember, half of this goes to pay down debt. The doctor is now 30 years old. From 4 years of a $60,000 salary, $50,000 after taxes, the doctor has paid off $100,000 of the student loan, bringing the total debt down to -$180,000. \n\nBut after residency, the doctor begins to make significantly more\u2026at the age of 31. Remember our plumber is making $100,000 before taxes\u2026.but our doctor starts out making $320,000 before taxes. After taxes, this should be about $250,000 - half of that pays off a student down. The doctor will have paid off the student loans by the age of 32 with $75,000 in investments and net worth. By the age of 40, assuming the doctor is still making $320,000 per year and investing half, the doctor will have a net worth of $1,575,000. \n\nNow lets say the doctor gets a pay raise to $450,000 per year at the age of 40, or $350,000 after taxes - and again invests half of that. By the age of 50 years old, the doctor is worth over $6.1 million dollars, or $2.3 million dollars more than the plumber. \n\nThe break even point where the doctor and plumber have the same net worth, in this above calculation, is about 42 years old. That means when both our plumber and doctor are 42, they will be work exactly the same, even though they took dramatically different paths. \n\nThe purpose of this is to illustrate that the prestige of a career has less of an impact on how much you\u2019re worth and it\u2019s more about saving and investing early on that are going to make the biggest differences. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do, you still have the potential to become wealthy and financially independent later on in life. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-08T23:30:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to invest","how to invest your money","how to make a million dollars","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","stock market 101","real estate 101","plumber vs doctor","how to make money in stocks","how to make money in real estate","gary vee","tai lopez","grant cardone"],"title":"Doctor vs Plumber: Which person is WEALTHIER at Age 42","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QsdcYyg3HX4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QsdcYyg3HX4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QsdcYyg3HX4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QsdcYyg3HX4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QsdcYyg3HX4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT8M9S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3770","dislikeCount":"1129","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19367","viewCount":"581100"}},{"id":"2YMseo5TVdk","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s what you often don\u2019t see behind almost every success story out there, and I\u2019m sure these are things we all go through. These are a few of the struggles along the way from my perspective\u2026enjoy! Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\n1. The loneliness. When I first started selling real estate and working as a real estate agent, everyone was significantly older than me - and being in an office full of middle-aged people made it extremely difficult for me to relate to friend my own age. That, combined with my work schedule and different interests, made it really difficult to make friends my own age. It wasn\u2019t easy building friendships outside of school and took a lot of time to cultivate these relationships.\n\n2. The random things I\u2019d give up along the way. College could have been one of them - no regrets, but I definitely wonder what it would have been like to go. But even smaller things, like investing becoming a priority, diligently saving, delayed gratification - all of this came up from time to time.\n\n3. The stress. I\u2019m incredibly invested in every one of my deals and don\u2019t want to let anyone down. There\u2019s definitely the uncertainty that I might not live up to someone\u2019s expectations and that takes a toll. \n\n4. The doubt. Even though I can look at anyone\u2019s real estate deal objectively without a problem, when it comes to myself, I doubt it - just the nature of the game. So it\u2019s definitely not easy for me to figure out which decision is best. \n\n5. The uncertainty. I don\u2019t know all the answers and I do my best to make the decision I believe is the best at the time, given the situation. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not always right and I have no idea until after the fact. \n\nIf I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s felt like this, comment below and let me know - I read them all! :)\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2017-12-06T23:30:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to flip real estate","how to wholesale real estate","how to investin real estate","real estate market","how to make money in real estate","how to make a million dollars","how i became a millionaire","how to invest in stocks","how to invest","real estate agent mentor","tai lopez","grant cardone","gary vee","real estate","real estate 101","investing 101","realtor"],"title":"The Truth Behind Every Success...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2YMseo5TVdk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2YMseo5TVdk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2YMseo5TVdk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2YMseo5TVdk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2YMseo5TVdk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"344","dislikeCount":"22","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1086","viewCount":"18525"}},{"id":"dHjyIB44moQ","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s how you can go about investing to a million dollars and some of the methods I\u2019m using for you to begin to replicate. I\u2019ll start with some specific investments, move on to where I get the most value, and then discuss how you can accelerate that growth - enjoy! Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nFor me, my biggest investment has been in real estate. Here\u2019s exactly what my strategy is: I buy an undervalued property that needs to be fixed up, I fix it up - increasing the value of the home - and I rent it out. I make my biggest profits my doing this. The monthly cashflow of rental property is also fantastic for hitting a fairly substantial rate of return. \n\nI then invest in Index Funds, specifically Vanguard VFIAX. It\u2019s an SP500 index fund that\u2019s fairly passive. I invest in this fund through a Roth IRA and SEP 401K. There are a ton of different fund out there for you to look into with fairly decent historic returns.\n\nInvesting in individual stocks could also be an option. I don\u2019t do this because the stock market isn\u2019t really my specialty, I don\u2019t want to spend my time following companies and trading, but many people make a decent return if you put in the research. This is another risk vs reward scenario - the risk is higher, but the returns can be higher if you pick the right stock at the right time.\n\nIf you have any other discretionary income you want to invest with, you could always look into peer-to-peer lending like LendingClub or Prosper. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call this a long term strategy, but it could be profitable in the short term.\n\nYou could also look into cryptocurrencies - again, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call this a long term investment strategy - but hey, if you have money you can afford to risk and you really believe in it, I\u2019m not going to stop you. I definitely wouldn\u2019t replace a proven long term investment strategy with crypto, but if you want to play around with it, sure - maybe Bitcoin hits 100k. Who knows.\n\nFrom here, we can speed up the investment process dramatically by investing in a tax advantaged account. The two big ones to check out are a Roth IRA and 401k. These are just accounts you can set up where you can buy investments within them. So you can still own all of your stocks you want, but you can do it within Roth IRA or 401k account for better tax treatment, which will help sped up the process to a million. \n\nLastly, accelerate your growth by living under your means and saving \/ investing as much as you can. I say this all too frequently but that\u2019s because it\u2019s the truth. The more you invest, the quicker this will all pay off. \n\nI\u2019d also make sure to pay off any debt, if you have any - especially if it\u2019s something with a stupid high interest rate. If you have a large credit card bill, make sure to pay that off. If you have stupid high student loans at a crazy high interest rate, make sure you pay those off as well. Debt is great if you leverage it to make more money, but debt is awful if it\u2019s holding you down and costing you money. So make sure to pay off debts - sounds obvious, but you\u2019d be surprised. \n\nThis video might seem a little repetitive and that\u2019s because it is. The basics to this don\u2019t really change, and neither do the specifics - it\u2019s fairly boring. The difference here is consistency and discipline to invest over a long period of time. Otherwise the math behind it is surprisingly simple.

Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\n\u201cMillionaire\u201d seems to be the first number people think about when they think wealth - but only 5% of people in the US actually ever achieve that number, and it\u2019s even smaller when you only count individuals vs household net worth, and even smaller when you count for people that are self made versus inheritance.\n\nThis is how I\u2019ve done it and you can do it, too. My background: no college degree, I didn\u2019t come from family money, no inheritance, I won\u2019t say my exact net worth but it was over a million by the time I was 26. And even though I\u2019ve had fairly high income throughout my career in real estate, I wouldn\u2019t be worth over a million had I not done these few specific things. \n\nTo start, it\u2019s really all a numbers game. You likely won\u2019t do it by saving your way to a million. To save up $1,000,000\u2026if you saved $50 per day\u2026it\u2019ll take you almost 55 years to reach $1m. And in 55 years from now, $1,000,000 will barely be enough to buy a BigMac when you factor in inflation. Even if you saved $200 per day, every single day, it\u2019ll take you 13.5 years to get to a million dollars! \n\nInstead, the most consistent way to reach the million dollar net worth mark is to invest. Think of it like leveraging your time. You can\u2019t just trade your time for money - there\u2019s a limit to how much you can do with one hour for $x dollars - that scenario will potentially take you DECADES. You NEED to trade your money for more money to hit a million in a much shorter time frame. And this is how you\u2019ll actually hit $1,000,000. Once your money starts compounding and you let your earned money make you even more money, that\u2019s when you begin to see your net worth growing at a dramatically faster rate - much faster than you can do on your own.\n\nTo make the most of this, don\u2019t waste money on useless things and live below your means. It\u2019s also vital to start as young as possible. Thanks to compound interest, the sooner you start, the more you will have later on. Also, think long term - not short term. Realistically, you won\u2019t hit a million in a few years unless you make a ton of money in a business, invest at the right place and time,  or end up in unique situations where you can expect a huge pay day. For almost everyone else out there, it\u2019s just a matter of saving, investing, and keeping your spending at a minimum throughout the process. That\u2019s all there is to it when you really get down to it. Breaking it down makes it a much simpler goal.

Even if it makes the home just look 1% better, it\u2019s worth it. \n\nNumber 2: Always use professional photography. This can often get the highest ROI of anything you spend on a listing. A bad picture could deter a LOT of people from evening wanting to see a home.\n\nNumber 3: Always show up on time. As a Realtor, you should never be late. It sets a negative tone from the beginning. \n\nNumber 4: Speak with excitement about the home. Too many real estate agents just let people walk around - don\u2019t do this. It doesn\u2019t demonstrate any details that could often be missed. \n\nNumber 5: Always pick up your phone and return your emails ASAP. The longer you wait to return a call, the more likely the deal will fall through. \n\nNumber 6: Always be ready to write an offer. Same as above, the longer you wait, the more likely they are to lose interest and the more likely you\u2019ll be competing with another offer. \n\nThanks so much for watching!\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n(Do not send me random questions here - the youtube comments are best.

We all know Buyers are Liars in that they generally don\u2019t know what they want until they see it. It\u2019s up to you as an agent to show buyers the homes you feel would be a good fit. Do not just limit your search to the homes buyers say they want to see - often times they\u2019ll end up buying something entirely different than what they say they wanted. Don\u2019t miss out on losing a deal because of this.\n\nMistake Number Two: Not following up. You could have the perfect advertising, the perfect sales pitch, and the perfect product - but if you don\u2019t follow up, it\u2019s all for nothing. Follow up. Sometimes it\u2019ll take a long time to work out, but consistent follow up is essential.\n\nMistake Number Three: Not treating every client equally. I missed out on a few good sales just because I didn\u2019t take the client seriously. From this, I\u2019ve lost out on deals that could\u2019ve potentially lead to millions in commissions\u2026lesson learned. This is my story that changed how I go about categorizing clients. \n\nThanks so much for watching, I hope this was helpful! \n\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n(Do not send me random questions here - the youtube comments are best.

Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nMistake #1: Spending more than you make. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you make, it\u2019s how much you save. It\u2019s important to track your expenses and budget appropriately, and pay yourself first. \n\nMistake #2: Leaving too much in cash without investing. The sad truth is that with inflation, the money you keep in cash actually loses its buying power year after year. With an average inflation rate of 2%, this means that every $100 you have saved will be worth $98 the year after. While it\u2019s important to keep an emergency fund and not invest the money you\u2019ll need in the short term, everything else should be earning you more money.\n\nMistake #3: Don\u2019t carry a credit card balance. The average person has $5700 of credit card debt, and the average credit card interest rate is 16.15%. This equates to $920 per YEAR wasted on credit card interest. If you just invested that amount over 30 years at a 10% gross return, that would be equal to $182,000\u2026that\u2019s how much the average person is losing long term over unpaid credit card balances. \n\nMistake #4: Don\u2019t ignore your credit score. It\u2019s easy not to pay attention to this, but it\u2019s so important. Building your credit score will save you a lot of money when it comes time to get a car loan or mortgage payment. Even the difference of 0.5% per year can add up to a LOT of money. On a 30-year $250,000 mortgage, that 0.5% equates to more than $18,000 EXTRA out of pocket over the term of the loan. \n\nMistake #5: Don\u2019t invest in something you don\u2019t fully understand. If you\u2019re confused about what you\u2019re investing in, don\u2019t invest in it. Understand the risks with investing and only invest in what you\u2019re comfortable with. \n\nThank you again for watching!

I\u2019ll break it down, share the numbers, and share what\u2019s worked best with me. Enjoy! Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nI have three main sources of income when it comes to this number:\n1. Working as a real estate agent\n2. Rental property income\n3. Equity gained by buying a renovating a property\n\nSo lets talk about the largest income source, and that\u2019s working as a Real Estate Agent. In 2017, I had 19 total transactions\u202611 sales and 8 leases. In total, that worked out to $21,838,100 in total sales volume. Now my business isn\u2019t so much structured around selling as many houses as possible, but it\u2019s about focusing on fewer, higher priced listings throughout my current and existing clientele. \n\nMost of this sales volume was made up between repeat and referral business, and this is how I\u2019ve structured my business. This is how I was able to achieve a $22m sales volume without much prospecting, without driving myself crazy working nutty hours, and how I\u2019ve still managed to increase my sales volume every single year, while still making 2-3x youtube videos per week, buying properties, and having free time. That\u2019s why I also put such a huge importance on customer service, because making a good impression early on = huge payouts later on, and everyone benefits from this. \n\nThe next income source is my rental income. Right now I have 7 tenants, and this worked out to about $4650 per month\u2026it was about 30% lower for most of last year since I was in the process of buying a duplex, so the net income was a little less than it is now, but you get the idea. Again, to get this rental income, this is about 6 years in the works in terms of of savings and investing since buying my first place. So didn\u2019t come quick, but it\u2019s something that was able to scale nicely over time. This is also where I try to keep my expenses at every year, and that allows me to save everything else I make\u2026so even though I make way more, there\u2019s no sense spending it if you don\u2019t absolutely have to. \n\nFinally, my last source is equity. The last two main properties I bought and renovated both went up in value by about $150,000 last year, which means I\u2019ve gained an extra $300,000 home equity. Yes I count this as income because I purposefully bought these properties to fix up in areas that I felt were going to increase in value, and they did, and I could sell them for profit if I wanted to, but I\u2019d rather keep them and do a cash out refinance. This saves on taxes AND I get to keep the property. This has always been my philosophy when it comes to investing in real estate - it\u2019s to buy something that needs work in an area next to other ares that have rapidly increased in value, fix it up, and reap the increased equity as it goes up in value. From there, you can cash-out refinance and continue.\n\nSo between the approximately $480,000 of income from my first two sources, plus $300,000 in appreciation, my real estate total for 2017 came to $780,000, or $65,000 per month. Again, not counting some other things in this just to keep this simple, but you get the idea.\n\nSo here are my main takeaways from this:\nFirst, in any business, do it for the long run. Customer service is so important, and without it, there\u2019d be no way I\u2019d have any repeat clients, ever. Nothing great is built overnight. Set long term goals and stay consistent with it. \n\nThe next\u2026save. Doesn\u2019t matter if you make $50,000 per year or $500,000 per year. Save as much as you can. And once you save, invest it. \n\nFinally, diversify your income if you can. Plus it\u2019s easier to make more money when you have a few different sources of income coming in, especially if those other sources are passive and it\u2019s something you can leverage.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-01-17T23:30:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate investor","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to make money in real estate","how to make money as a real estate agent","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in the stock market","how i became a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","how to buy real estate","how to flip real estate","how to be a real estate agent","grant cardone","gary vee","tai lopez","real estate 101","stock market 101","how to make money"],"title":"Here\u2019s how I made $65,000 PER MONTH in Real Estate in 2017 (Income Breakdown + Strategies)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XSZANCGIfe8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XSZANCGIfe8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XSZANCGIfe8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XSZANCGIfe8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XSZANCGIfe8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"631","dislikeCount":"79","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4124","viewCount":"126459"}},{"id":"fjicjKaqjV0","snippet":{"description":"These are my thoughts on Altcoins and my overall hesitations with the market in general. For my subs that that don\u2019t like crypto videos\u2026don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t make many of these and I do my best to make them as informative and unbiased as possible, so there\u2019s no personal agenda behind this. Enjoy! Snap\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nJust a quick disclosure here - I\u2019m invested in several Altcoins and there\u2019s a few I think have a ton of potential. I\u2019m not going to mention any of them, I\u2019m not going to FUD anything I think is awful, I have nothing against altcoins, not gonna talk poorly about anything specific, but I wanted to focus on this market in general, the current state of its popularity, and a few of my concerns behind it. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think we\u2019ll see some promising growth long term from some alt coins, I\u2019m sure and some of which I think could be a real contender of Bitcoin and Ethereum. I actually think altcoins in general will have a lot of potential and we\u2019re really just in the infancy stage of all of it\u2026but the current way this is going is unsustainable. There is no way so many of these coins can sustain these price increases where you can profit consistently unless you\u2019re lucky, you plan your entry and exit points and get them right based off technical knowledge, or you\u2019re in \u201cthe know.\u201d I hear so many people talking about the dollar being manipulated, but wow\u2026he level of manipulation in these altcoins is through the roof. \n\nThe amount of shilling and pump and dumps I\u2019m seeing is atrocious. Right now is really like the wild wild west where it\u2019s a total free for all and it\u2019s all entirely unregulated, where the price of a coin depends more on the marketing and the right twitter shout outs than the technology behind it\u2026some coins don\u2019t even having a working product! Think about that for a second. \n\nTHIS is my concern. I\u2019m not talking about any one coin specifically, because some of them I really like, and some of them are just so absurd. But the sad reality is that the absurd coin could pay for some shout outs and if a pump and dump group gets in on it, with the right combination of a price increase and marketing, it could skyrocket. Makes zero sense, but because of the unregulation of this, it\u2019s basically a free for all. And now, every other company is hopping on the \u201clets make a coin\u201d train and trying to implement their own currencies. And they\u2019re making a ton of money in the process.\n\nThe reality here is that this just isn\u2019t sustainable long term. Something will have to change at some point\u2026i don\u2019t think this can continue in the long run, nor do I think this is an indication of a healthy market. It\u2019s nothing against Altcoins or cryptocurrency, it\u2019s just about something having real use and longevity. When a single tweet has the power to send a coin up 500% in a week, or down 80% in a day, that really says something about the speculative nature of this market. And because we\u2019re all still so early to this and all of this is still extremely new, relative to every other market, we\u2019ve got a ways to go before we how this plays out and can realistically value a coin. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not against alt coins at all. I like many of them. I think many are absolutely crazy. I think some have potential and some are outright unreal. In terms of money to be made, you can make a ton, you could lose a ton. Even though I\u2019ve made money from alts so far, I\u2019m not naive to the fact that I could just as easily lose it all in the next week. So when I raise my concerns, it\u2019s coming from a place of being completely unbiased on how this plays out. \n\nI\u2019m not saying it makes sense just to sit on the sidelines and watch, either, but just to be realistic with your expectations that many of these will end up failing. Some of them may do well. But I\u2019d hate to see people get burned and lose money because they didn\u2019t fully understand what they were getting into. That\u2019s the entire point of this video.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-01-15T23:30:00Z","tags":["bitcoin","altcoins","altcoins 2018","bitcoin 2018","cryptocurrency 2018","altcoin trading","altcoin news","altcoins to buy","altcoin mining","altcoins to invest in","how to buy altcoins","how to buy bitcoin","how to invest in bitcoin","bitcoin explained","altcoins explained","bitcoin news","bitcoin millionaire","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","tai lopez","grant cardone","the crypto investor"],"title":"My concern with the current Altcoin market (be careful)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fjicjKaqjV0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fjicjKaqjV0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fjicjKaqjV0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fjicjKaqjV0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fjicjKaqjV0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M3S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"382","dislikeCount":"41","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"637","viewCount":"17690"}},{"id":"0tLnH96hRqE","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s one of the best ways to get business whether your a real estate agent going for listings, a buyer looking for something off market, a flipper, or a wholesaler looking for good deals. And this is widely overlooked\u2026expired listings! Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. As a real estate agent, when it comes time to sell a house, you get what\u2019s called a listing. If an agent can\u2019t sell the home during the listing and that time period expires, it\u2019s called \u201can expired listing.\u201d Basically the agent that had the listing on that home no longer has a contract with the seller. This means that every single day new properties are expiring on the market. \n\nThese are the most targeted leads you could ever get in real estate. These are real, willing sellers who literally tried to sell their home. You know they WANT to sell. This isn\u2019t you just meeting thousands of people hoping one is going to sell\u2026you\u2019re going after people who have proven that they\u2019re serious enough to put their home on the market with an agent. This is like the jackpot in terms of potential. And this also applies whether you\u2019re a realtor looking for a listing, a wholesaler looking to find an off market deal, or even a buyer looking to buy something without paying commission. \n\nOnce you find an expired listing, the first thing I like to do is research it. I like to learn EVERYTHING about it. The more information you have, the better you\u2019ll be at this. \n\nThe next thing I\u2019ll do is call the last listing agent. The reason why is that often times the listing agent just let the home expire to then re-list as a new listing just a few days later. Or, maybe it\u2019s still under contract even though it\u2019s expired online. I like to avoid situations where I might be imposing on another agent, or wasting my time if the seller is still working with them\u2026so I like to call. Every time I\u2019ve done this, I\u2019ve gotten a really positive response. If the agent is still working with the seller, they\u2019re glad you called and they\u2019ll let you know, and you\u2019ve just saved a ton of time. If they\u2019re not, often they\u2019ll let you know and they\u2019ve had a negative experience and just glad to be done with the seller. \n\nFrom there, the next thing you can do is go and door knock that home to introduce yourself and see if this is someone you could work with. Prepare a small package you can leave with the seller. It should include some information about their property, some recent sales in the area, a market analysis, information about you, and how you plan to sell the home. Make it as tailored to their property as possible\u2026if it\u2019s generic, it\u2019s not going to be as effective. Everyone just does really generic advertisements and they\u2019re a dime a dozen, make sure you stand out. If they do answer, say you saw the listing expire and you wanted to introduce yourself and offer some information about the neighborhood and the services you offer. It\u2019s not so much about selling yourself, but about finding what they\u2019re looking for and helping THEM. It\u2019s a subtle difference here, don\u2019t just e about you\u2026this is 100% about them, so make everything geared towards helping them.\n\nIn a way, you\u2019re interviewing THEM just as much as they are you. You need to find out if this is someone realistic who you can work with. You need to make sure their expectations match up with what you can do. \n\nFind out what happened and then improve on that. Use this as a foundation to build on! After this, I\u2019d go for the listing appointment to show them exactly what you can offer and how you plan to solve their problems and get their home sold. If you\u2019re a buyer, see if you can check out the home to see if it\u2019s something worth purchasing.\n\nGet $10 by signing up on Coinbase after your first $100 purchase: https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/5a20f244e07edf019d1ce550\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-01-12T21:30:01Z","tags":["expired listings","expired listing calls","expired listing scripts","expired listing prospecting","expired listing door knocking","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to make money in real estate","how to invest in real estate","how I became a millionaire","how to save a million dollars","how to buy real estate","how to flip properties","stock market 101","real estate 101","how to make money flipping","how to wholesale real estate","grant cardone","tai lopez"],"title":"Expired Listings: How to get the BEST leads as a Real Estate Agent, Investor, or Wholesaler","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0tLnH96hRqE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0tLnH96hRqE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0tLnH96hRqE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0tLnH96hRqE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0tLnH96hRqE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M26S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"249","dislikeCount":"24","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2979","viewCount":"41477"}},{"id":"jsZyMryPH-A","snippet":{"description":"Almost everything you do is selling - whether you\u2019re selling a product, a house, yourself, or making sure you guys smash the like button (jk)\u2026you\u2019re selling.

You could absolutely awful at just about every other aspect, but if you\u2019re really excited about whatever it is, you\u2019ll still come out ahead. Think of it like this - people pick up on how you feel. If you feel bad about something, it\u2019ll come through in the subtleties of how you act, the way you speak, and the words you use - at a subconscious level, this is very, very difficult to fake. \n\nJust this one small change could make all the difference - being excited and passionate about what you\u2019re talking about. You really, really need to believe it\u2026and not a fake believing, either. If you fake it, it doesn\u2019t quite work - you actually need to be excited about it and you actually need to believe it, otherwise it\u2019s not going to work and people are going to see through it. \n\nHaving this excitement and enthusiasm is often what leads people to do really, really well at something in the beginning, only to have their excitement and sales ability dwindle as they settle down and get complacent. I see it all the time. People go into something and have a ton of excitement and enthusiasm because it\u2019s new\u2026and then they slowly do worse over time, even though their knowledge and technical ability go up. You need to maintain that level of excitement and passion while also increasing your technical knowledge, and this is where things really take off. \n\nAnd keep in mind that anytime you\u2019re selling something, it needs to solve a problem. We primarily buy things that make our lives easier and bring enjoyment to us. It\u2019s much more difficult to sell something by really convincing someone they need it than to figure out the problems that person has and provide a solution. \n\nThis is why I believe the best things really tend to sell themselves, without really any convincing. It should be easy. Think of it this way, if you need to convince someone to do something, it\u2019s much less effective than figuring out what that person needs and providing it to them, while really believing in it at the same time.\n\nIdeally, everything you should do should be a win-win. It should actually benefit the other person MORE than you, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s sustainable. The way I see it, if you sell anything, it should be sustainable long term\u2026if you ever take advantage of someone, you\u2019ll never get their trust back. And honestly, that\u2019s a lose-lose\u2026in real estate, my repeat business has made my entire career.

Enjoy! Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nTo preface this, Grant Cardone has a video explaining why you you should \u201crent where you live, but own what you can rent.\u201d His reasoning behind it is fairly logical: the majority of people see the home they buy as an investment and don\u2019t look at the opportunity cost of this money, so they don\u2019t fully understand the expenses that come with owning a home. Grant explains that instead of tying up money in a home you live in, you should use that to invest in multi-family real estate - and then, rent where you live, because that\u2019s less expensive. His reasoning is that he can rent a home for much cheaper than it would cost to own that home, he has more flexibility in moving around, and can leverage his money more by investing it. \n\nBut lets break this down a little further\u2026and then I\u2019ll give you my own thoughts on this, because I own where I live and own where I rent, and have purposely designed it this way for a reason, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly. \n\nThe biggest point with Grant\u2019s argument is that it\u2019s less expensive to rent a home than it is to own it, and you get a higher return elsewhere. And the answer to this is both a yes and a no at the same time, meaning it\u2019s largely dependent on your market. Here in Los Angeles, MANY areas are more expensive to own than rent\u2026in the higher end markets, home owners make more money in appreciation than they do in monthly cashflow, which often balance out the costs of buying vs renting.\n\nOther markets are the total opposite. Some markets are way cheaper to own. Outside of really high and really low cost of living areas, most markets tend to fall somewhere in the middle. It doesn\u2019t make a huge difference either way, BUT with owning, you generally have a little more control with what you do with the property, and you\u2019re not worried about a landlord kicking you out on a whim out of nowhere. So Grant\u2019s argument can be true depending on the situation, but it\u2019s also false in other markets. \n\nThe problem here is that for most people never do any research about which is better for their situation, and automatically assume they should buy because \u201cit\u2019s a good investment long term,\u201d which won\u2019t always be the case.\n\nI like to own where I live and own where I rent. This gives me ultimate control of both words and most people don\u2019t realize the HUGE opportunities of buying where you live. First off, buying where you live gives you this immediate advantage over an investment property\u2026it allows you to put less money down at a lower interest rate. The difference between paying a 4.5% and 4% rate can add up to an enormous amount of money over 30 years. The other advantage here is that you can buy a property that needs a significant amount of work and renovate it. This is what I\u2019ve always done, for every single property I\u2019ve bought. \n\nBy renovating a property, you can walk away with a significant amount of equity\u2026So right off the bat, I\u2019m coming out ahead by buying and renovating, than just flat out renting something. Even if I pay more for buying, I\u2019ve just made way more money in equity. \n\nNow, granted, you could also do this for an investment property and rent it out for a higher price, but my approach has been to buy a home as a primary residence, get the lower interest rate, renovate it, and then move in and live in it for awhile. Enjoy owning without having a landlord. When the time comes, buy something else and rent out the house you were living in. Now you have a renovated investment property, financed at a lower interest rate with less money down, that you can one day rent out. Ideally the property SHOULD cash flow though, which is why you need to anticipate the rents ahead of time and what your total cost will be. But when done correctly, you\u2019ll end up with a great cash flowing property.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nGet $10 by signing up on Coinbase after your first $100 purchase: https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/5a20f244e07edf019d1ce550\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-01-08T23:30:00Z","tags":["Grant Cardone","real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to flip properties","how to invest","how to invest your money","how to buy real estate","how to buy rental properties","how to invest in real estate","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","how to invest in stocks","stock market 101","real estate 101","how to make money flipping real estate","how to wholesale property","graham stephan"],"title":"Why I DON\u2019T follow Grant Cardone\u2019s \u201cRent where you live, but own what you rent\u201d","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PtgRT91cqVg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PtgRT91cqVg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PtgRT91cqVg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PtgRT91cqVg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PtgRT91cqVg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1130","dislikeCount":"239","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8570","viewCount":"276080"}},{"id":"sck-n86ygR8","snippet":{"description":"This is my video application for Realtor\u00ae Magazine's 30 under 30 contest.

Do your own Due Diligence. I don't discuss politics. Consult a tax professional for any of your questions.  This is purely my interpretation and my thoughts with regard to the 2018 GOP Tax Reform with how it relates to real estate. Thanks for watching! Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nNotable Changes:\n\nThe mortgage  interest deduction. It was previously capped at $1,000,000, which means you can deduct the interest on the first $1,000,000 of your mortgage. This deduction is now lowered to $750,000 for any new home purchases. This means that any interest you pay above a $750,000 is not tax deductible. \n\nFor most of the US, this doesn\u2019t make a difference at all. The median US home price is about $258,000. This impacts high cost of living areas with home prices above $800,000 or so, but even that impact is very minimal in terms of an interest deduction\u2026and most likely that person will end up saving money in other areas to make up for that deduction. \n\nThe next big change is the limit on property tax and state deductions (SALT). In relation to real estate exclusively, this means that your property tax deduction is capped at $10,000 per year, instead of being unlimited like it was prior. And like I said, this doesn\u2019t impact the majority of the United States where housing is all under $800,000. \n\nThe next is that it appears as though home equity and HELOC loans are not tax deductible on a primary residence.\n\nA positive for real estate is a shortened depreciation schedule. In commercial real estate, you used to be able to depreciate the property over 39 years, and in residential it\u2019s 27.5 years. This was shortened to 25 years for both. \n\nThey didn\u2019t get rid of the provision of capital gains exclusion on a primary residence. If you\u2019ve lived in your house for 2 of the last 5 years, you can exclude paying taxes on the first $250,000 if you\u2019re single and $500,000 if you\u2019re married. \n\nFor rental properties, this makes them MUCH more attractive in comparison to buying a primary residence, but ONLY if that primary residence is over $850,000 or so. If your house is worth under about $850,000 or so, the tax plan really has no affect on you, other than not deducting a HELOC or home equity line of credit. For rental properties, nothing has changed and you can now depreciate them 2.5 years faster than before. \n\nFor a home owner buying a home above $1 million dollars or so, it got more expensive. The property tax deduction was a great deduction for people in the high price range. However, my thought is that even though housing becomes a little more expensive, I don\u2019t think people in this price point will be deterred from buying because of a marginal savings in whatever they were writing off. \n\nFrankly, depending on the industry, you should be overall saving more money, so this should entirely balance out, if not come in your favor. So those are my thoughts. I don\u2019t want to turn this into a political video, I stay out of that, I\u2019m not picking sides, but it is what it is and I\u2019ll report on the changes and what I think this means for prices. Also, keep in mind I\u2019m not a tax consultant and you\u2019ll need to consult with a specialist since taxes are such a personal matter. This is not legal or tax advice.

Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: $50 off with code ThankYou50 for a limited time:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group (It\u2019s free):\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nWhen it comes to this topic, I\u2019m friends and have worked with maybe a dozen or so self-made millionaires, all in their 20\u2019s - and the cool thing is that they all seem to have the same \u201ctype\u201d of personality traits, regardless of how they\u2019ve made their money. Step one: have a million dollars. JK. But for real, I think it\u2019s important to note there are some commonalities between them and it\u2019s important to recognize what they are so you can begin incorporating them into your life, as well. \n\nThey all have a sense of Urgency. They realize that they need to do something NOW. There is no tomorrow, there\u2019s no next week or next month\u2026it\u2019s today, it\u2019s this very second that matters. Nothing good happens tomorrow that can\u2019t start right now. Thinking that you\u2019ll get around to something \u201cnext week\u201d is a surefire way to kill what you want to do and never get around to it. From everything I\u2019ve ever done, nothing good EVER came from waiting for the right opportunity or right time. The right time doesn\u2019t ever really exist, it\u2019s now. So if there\u2019s something you want to do, don\u2019t just wait for everything to line up in your favor - it likely won\u2019t. Having that sense of urgency is what it takes to begin moving forward. \n\nThey\u2019re okay with Delayed Gratification. \nIt\u2019s not about short term results and immediate rewards\u2026it\u2019s about the bigger picture. It seems like so many people just want the \u201cquick fix\u201d or \u201cshortcut\u201d to make something happen in the moment..but the type of person who is okay with delayed gratification is also the type of person who has patience, who sees everything like a game of chess rather than just bowling a quick strike. \n\nThey don\u2019t have any excuses. This is a big one. You need to take ownership of your life. You are responsible for your own success and no one owes you anything - and that is the harsh reality. This is something that I\u2019ve recently noticed in the last year since posting on YouTube - I can tell pretty quickly who\u2019ll be successful and who won\u2019t be just based off the excuses I get. \u201cI can\u2019t do this because of that.\u201d \u201cThat won\u2019t work for me because of xyz.\u201d \u201cToo many people are doing that already.\u201d \u201cIt won\u2019t work for me.\u201d \u201cI have an excuse because of this excuse.\u201d There is no excuse. You will find a way to make it work if you want it badly enough. \n\nThey see everything as a learning experience. Like I said, nothing ever goes perfectly\u2026and instead of complaining about it or feeling bad if you fail, learn from it. You won\u2019t make the same mistake again. We\u2019ve all had things come up that don\u2019t go to plan\u2026but how you handle that is indicative of how you\u2019ll handle everything else going forward. It\u2019s also important not to take anything personally, if something doesn\u2019t work out it\u2019s rarely ever to do with you personally - it could be your delivery, it could be how you handled it, it could be that you didn\u2019t know enough about it. Never take anything personally. You will learn and get better over time, I promise - every failure is just a step in the right direction, you won\u2019t fail forever. Learn from what you\u2019re doing and keep going.\n\nFinally, they\u2019re focused. They pick one thing and they won\u2019t stop until it\u2019s done. They don\u2019t waver with what they should be doing, try it for a few days, then put it off for a bit, then come back to it - or maybe try something else.

The thing is, at the end of the day, it really doesn\u2019t matter how much money you make, it\u2019s how much of that you can keep - whether you make $50,000 or $500,000 - if you spend it all, you\u2019ll have nothing left to show for it. That means you\u2019ll have to go back to work the next day and start over after every paycheck, just to replenish whatever money you\u2019ve spent. If you don\u2019t mind continuing to work and trading your time to pay for these things, fine\u2026but for the rest of us that don\u2019t want to rely on a job to pay for the things that really matter the most, it all begins with saving. \n\nAnd these are the easiest ways to save, without really feeling like you\u2019re saving\u2026\n\n1. Buy it tomorrow - not in the moment\nThis helps cut down on impulse purchases. Waiting a day to buy something, often times the excitement of buying something new will wear off and you\u2019ll be able to decide with a clear mind if it\u2019s something you should really buy. \n\n2. f you\u2019ve waited a day to buy it, then ask yourself: If someone were to offer me this product or its cash value, which would I take?\nThis has cut down on a LOT of the purchases I would\u2019ve made, because frankly, I\u2019d just rather have the cash. This just helps put things in perspective and really focus on what you\u2019d rather have\u2026cash, or the item. \n\n3. How many hours will I have to work to afford this?\nIf you\u2019re making $15 per hour, spending $45 on a dinner is basically costing you 3 hours of your life. Spending $300 on a new pair of shoes is equivalent to 20 hours of your life\u2026just for a pair of shoes. Spending $12 on a Nicolas Cage Pillow Case is going to cost you 50 minutes of your time\u2026decide from here if this is really worth it to you. \n\n4. Set aside what you save \nThis is my favorite one of all\u2026lets say decided \u201cI don\u2019t need that Nicolas cage pillow.\u201d I\u2019ve just saved $12. As a \u201creward\u201d for saving that amount, I\u2019ll just transfer that money in a separate account where I\u2019ll later invest it. That way it\u2019s just fun to see all the ways I cut back, and all of a sudden I have thousands of dollars sitting in bank account from money I\u2019ve just decided wasn\u2019t worth spending on Nicolas Cage Pillows. You can do the same thing. Lets say you decide to order a $15 meal instead of a $50 meal that you would\u2019ve otherwise got\u2026take the $35 difference, put it away, and later invest it. It\u2019s like an immediate reward for not spending. \n\n5. See everything in its future value\nWhen you invest your money, it\u2019ll grow - so when you spend this money, you\u2019re basically just halting the growth that money would\u2019ve made you. If you invest the cost of the Nicolas cage pillowcase of $12 over 35 years at an 8% return\u2026that means the $12 pillow is really worth $177. I\u2019d rather have the $177 because I won\u2019t get that much value from the pillow case. Everything you do has a future value. Determining what it is. \n\nThanks for watching! \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-02-21T23:30:02Z","tags":["HOW TO SAVE MONEY","how to save money 2018","how to save more money","money saving tricks","how to save money fast","how to save money as a teenager","how to save money as a kid","how to save money for a house","how to save money for a car","how to save money with low income","how to save money on groceries","how to invest money","how to make money in real estate","real estate agent","real estate mentor","investing 101","real estate agent 101","gary vee","tai lopez","grant cardone"],"title":"How I saved over $300,000 in 2017 - How to Save Money 101 (Five Steps)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/weVjJJxuW7s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/weVjJJxuW7s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/weVjJJxuW7s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/weVjJJxuW7s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/weVjJJxuW7s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"324","dislikeCount":"16","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1002","viewCount":"20229"}},{"id":"P-23xjoRWlU","snippet":{"description":"In this discussion, we go over what happened during the listing appointment and what he could improve on going forward.

It's okay. It's a learning experience. \n\n6:20 - Research everything about the home. This is first step. Figure out when the seller bought the property and for how much. \n\n7:55 - Go in with as much INFORMATION as possible. \n\n8:30 - Show up early. Don't go into the listing presentation right away. Ask for a tour of the home to build rapport. Ask what they've done to the home. Ask why they bought this home. Why they're selling. The more information you have, the better. The more discussion you have, the better. Build a personal connection. \n\n11:00 - Make it about what THEY want. This is all about the seller.

Make money when you buy. \nThis is absolutely crucial when you invest in real estate - you either need to buy into cash flow, buy into equity, or buy into a combination of the two. Do not do what everyone else does and buy something at market rate for market rent without allowing yourself some room to improve those numbers, and your investment\n\n2. Never fall in love with an investment\nThis is one I see too many people fall victim to. They go out to look for an investment, then see a home they \u201cfall in love\u201d with, despite it being a terrible money-sucking investment. But hey\u2026maybe it\u2019s just really charming, or reminded them of their childhood house, or whatever\u2026point being, if it\u2019s an investment, it\u2019s a BUSINESS. Not a romantic-comedy. You cannot get emotionally attached to a property you\u2019re investing in.\n\n3. Big picture, laster focus\nWhile the bigger picture is fine to pay attention to, local markets are much more important. Don\u2019t get too caught up in headlines and following trends because real estate is such a micro-economy. Each property and city is its own individual investment opportunity. While they can trail overall economics, every single property is like its own stock - some are undervalued, some are overvalued, some are going up in value, some are going down\u2026the specifics are what make this type of investment really, really unique. Your market will have its own opportunities outside of everything else that\u2019s going on. \n\n4. Think long term - get a fixed rate loan\nThis is one that I\u2019m a firm believer in. Some people might disagree with this, they might want to take a riskier approach, but my philosophy is simple: buy once and hold. Even though you might be able to get a cheaper loan by going for a 5-10 year Adjustable Rate Mortgage, which means that your interest rate will only be locked in for so many years before it\u2019s adjusted to market rate, it\u2019s much safer to lock in a one-time rate NOW and then hold it. You know your holding cost will at least remain consistent throughout the life of the loan, until you either refinance, pay it off entirely, or sell. \n\n5. Finally, make sure it cash flows. \nYou should focus primarily on your cash flow - how much money are you investing into the deal and how much will that make you every single month. Do NOT barely operate on a thin margin of cash flow unless you\u2019re making a significant amount of equity and have the cash reserves to pay out of pocket if and when something goes wrong. The biggest problem I see happening is when people cash flow a few hundred dollars on their investment, barely scraping by, and then something comes up and wipes out a years worth of profit\u2026even if they made a ton of money by paying down the loan, they need some type of cash flow for it to really make sense. Focus on cash flow, while still taking everything else into consideration. Cash flow first\u2026everything else second, then evaluate the deal from there. \n\n6. Bonus tip\u2026don\u2019t be your tenants best friend. \nI\u2019m a really, really nice landlord\u2026sometimes too nice. When I first started, I really wanted to be buddy-buddy with my tenants and be the \u201ccool\u201d landlord. No. Bad idea. This is often when you get taken advantage of, even if its not even intended\u2026this is when they start calling for personal favors, extended time on rent, or fixing things that aren\u2019t your responsibility to fix. This often puts you in a difficult position between being a friend and being a business person. And once you\u2019ve opened the friendship floodgates, it\u2019s difficult to shift into the mindset that you\u2019re running a business and that this is your investment. My biggest piece of advice is to treat it strictly as a business - be friendly to your tenants, but do not be friends. Stick to the contract and enforce it. It\u2019ll end up saving you in the long run. \n\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-02-16T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate investing","the 5 golden rules real estate investing","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","passive income real estate","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing audiobook","real estate investing 101","real estate 101","grant cardone","tai lopez","robert kiyosaki","passive income","real estate agent","how i became a millionaire","millionaire real estate"],"title":"The 5 Golden Rules of Real Estate Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/57tt-L-Xbj8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/57tt-L-Xbj8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/57tt-L-Xbj8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/57tt-L-Xbj8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/57tt-L-Xbj8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"317","dislikeCount":"105","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5950","viewCount":"226927"}},{"id":"1qWK4hLasFs","snippet":{"description":"Here's why 80% of New Years Resolutions fail by the second week of February and what you can do to make sure you don't become one of these statistics.

Maybe it was harder than you thought. Maybe you\u2019re just not as into it as you once were. Maybe the great idea you had just doesn\u2019t seem practical anymore or you got tired of it. And then it\u2019s easy to cut yourself a little slack here and there. And then a little more slack. And then it slowly becomes a distant memory of something you wanted to do but never followed through with. \n\nA study conducted in 2016 found that the factor that mattered the most in whether or not people kept their New Years resolution was\u2026ENJOYMENT. In other words, if participants actually enjoyed what they were doing, they were more likely to stick to the goal. It also found that immediate rewards from these newly formed habits, no matter how small, kept participants more engaged and motivated. \n\nSo with that said, if you\u2019ve found yourself with a goal but losing the motivation to continue\u2026begin focusing on the habits to get there rather than the goal itself. Focus on what you could be doing every day, and make a list. Come up with your plan. And stick to it. \n\nCreating habits takes patience and faith; the beginning is always the hardest part of the process. Many people give up before having created the habit, because they assume that the struggle will last forever - but it won\u2019t. The struggle won\u2019t last forever and making it past the first 6 weeks will be the hardest part of the entire journey - from there it just gets easier. \n\nPerhaps the biggest reason we fall off our New Year\u2019s Resolutions is that we forget the bigger picture. We forget what made us decide to try to change our lives. We accept short-term pleasure over long-term fulfillment. We take the easy route of \u201cI\u2019ll do it later, it\u2019s not that important, I don\u2019t feel like it\u201d over \u201cI have the potential to be this person one day.\u201d Especially if one day seems like a long time away..it\u2019s easy to put it off until tomorrow, since \u201cI have plenty of time to catch up until then.\u201d\n\nWhich brings me to Parkinson\u2019s Law and why this is a concept all of us should be familiar with, and why this is so relevant. Parkinson\u2019s Law states that: \u201cWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever worked a 9-5 job, you know that if you wanted, you could fill up the entire day with work and finish promptly by 5pm. But, if you were given the choice to leave at 1pm just so long as you got all of your work done\u2026you could get your work done. You\u2019d find a way. That\u2019s Parkinson\u2019s law. You will fill up the whatever allotted time you have to complete a task, whether it\u2019s an hour, a day, or a week. \n\nParkinson\u2019s Law should show you that we spend too much time procrastinating on tasks that can be accomplished at a much faster rate. A useful tactic is to shorten the duration you give yourself to accomplish a goal. If you\u2019ve set yourself a month to do something, give yourself one or two weeks. We underestimate what we can do in the short term and just how much you can really make happen if you need to. \n\nSo if you\u2019re one of those people who kinda forgot about your goals, let them slide, figured they weren\u2019t that important\u2026at least take the time to revisit them and see what you could be doing so you don\u2019t end up as the 80% of people who don\u2019t keep their New Years resolutions while browsing youtube and watching tai Lopez ads :)\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-02-14T23:30:00Z","tags":["why new years resolutions fail","why new years resolutions dont work","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to make money in real estate","how to invest in real estate","how to be a real estate agent","how to invest","how to make passive income","passive income real estate","real estate 101","investing 101","passive income 101","how to become a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","how i became a millionaire","tai lopez","grant cardone"],"title":"Why 80% of New Years Resolutions FAIL by today","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1qWK4hLasFs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1qWK4hLasFs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1qWK4hLasFs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1qWK4hLasFs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1qWK4hLasFs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M29S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"198","dislikeCount":"5","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"324","viewCount":"5501"}},{"id":"75Y4h0wI7ts","snippet":{"description":"After a LOT of careful consideration, I\u2019ve decided to create a step-by-step guide about how to become a real estate agent and how to actually make money in the business, covering over 100 topics and 8 hours of material. $50 off code ThankYou50 and early access: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nKeep in mind: originally this wasn\u2019t something I wanted to do, and I shrugged off the idea. But as the channel grew, I began getting thousands of requests from real estate agents to answer their questions, go over their concerns, and ask for advice. It became nearly impossible to answer everyone while still working full time, making 3x videos a week, and trying to focus on everything else I had to do. So I decided to make something that would benefit everyone who was interested in becoming a real estate agent, or wanting to expand what they\u2019re currently doing, in a format where I go over my entire career and exactly what\u2019s worked for me along the way - and this is that course. \n\nI know some people will be opposed to me offering a course, or thinking I\u2019m selling out, or trying to monetize the channel - but from my perspective, it was the only way I can expand what I\u2019m already doing - I want to offer something of value for people who are interested, and I have to do something that\u2019s scalable. I thought extensively about whether or not I wanted to do this. I\u2019ve built my entire channel on being as open, honest, and transparent as possible - and I always intend to keep it that way. But I really believe the value in this course is worth way more to the person watching it than I\u2019ll get from selling it. \n\nI\u2019m in this for the long haul\u2026I expect to still be doing YouTube when I\u2019m like 50 years old, so I\u2019d never risk doing something that could jeopardize that or ruin the trust that so many of you have put in me over the last year. So if I actually sell something, it better be the best damn course out there\u2026and that\u2019s where this begins. \n\nThis resulted in almost 100 videos on over 100 different topics, and over 8 hours straight of footage\u2026basically imagine almost my entire channel, doubled and focused on each topic of becoming a successful real estate agent. That\u2019s how intense I made this. \n\nSo with that said, this is literally everything I know about working and become a successful real estate agent, and I\u2019m calling it \u201cThe Real Estate Agent Academy.\u201d Keep a few things in mind - this is primarily geared towards the United States, and maybe Canada, so I\u2019m not sure how much other countries would benefit from this - some concepts definitely apply, but some might also be lost. Secondly, while I do believe this course could cut down your learning curve dramatically, doing this is a career\u2026it\u2019s not something you can really dabble in, and it\u2019s not likely something you can do and make hundreds of thousands in your first year\u2026this is a long term career. I want to make that very clear so we set expectations that while there\u2019s solid information in there, it\u2019s not a magic pill and requires you to put in the effort. Also. If you\u2019re currently working as a real estate agent and want to expand what you\u2019re already doing, I believe this could definitely benefit you as well. This doesn\u2019t cover wholesaling or investing, it\u2019s strictly working as a real estate agent.\n\nSo\u2026now that I\u2019ve got that out of the way, if you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll be giving $50 off and early access to the course if you sign up for the pre-launch. The link is above. I\u2019ll email out the coupon code when it goes live in the next week, and you\u2019ll have access to it with $50 off prior to anyone else knowing about it. When I make it public on YouTube, it\u2019ll be the normal price. So if you\u2019re interested, may as well just sign up - and you can decide later if it\u2019s something you want to buy or not, no pressure either way. \n\nAnd lastly, don\u2019t worry - absolutely nothing is going to change from the channel. I\u2019m not ever going to withhold information because it\u2019s on the course, everything is going to be the same, I\u2019m never going to shove this down anyone\u2019s throat, if you want to buy it, great, if not, that\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s just another option for anyone interested. I really want that to be clear\u2026nothing is going to change. Nothing. \n\nThank you again for all of your support, this is something I\u2019ve been really nervous about announcing because the last thing I want is for people to think I\u2019ve sold out, but it just comes down to me needing to do something scalable to offer value\u2026plus this is something I really believe in and proudly stand behind.","publishedAt":"2018-02-12T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate agent","how to be a real estate agent","how to be a real estate investor","how to make money as a real estate agent","how to get leads in real estate","how to make money in real estate","how to invest in real estate","real estate broker","real estate coach","real estate agent training","real estate agent career","real estate agent beginner","real estate agent tips","real estate agent day in the life","real estate agent salary","real estate agent 101"],"title":"Everything you need to know about being a Real Estate Agent: The Real Estate Agent Academy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/75Y4h0wI7ts\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/75Y4h0wI7ts\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/75Y4h0wI7ts\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/75Y4h0wI7ts\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/75Y4h0wI7ts\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M16S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"346","dislikeCount":"68","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1917","viewCount":"38000"}},{"id":"kB6Yro-h0GU","snippet":{"description":"We\u2019ve all heard the phrase, \u201cthe harder you work, the luckier you get.\u201d  But let\u2019s be real: some people just seem to get luckier than others. But is there any science behind it? Let\u2019s find out! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nLet\u2019s begin here: why are some people luckier? It\u2019s found that lucky people generally have the same types of qualities, and this is what\u2019s commonly found. \n\n1. Mindset. This found to be the most important and without this, everything else falls apart. Studies have shown that luckier people were more likely to view a negative scenario as an opportunity, seeing it as the glass half full - with every failure, they view it as \u201cit could have been worse.\u201d People who claimed they were \u201cunlucky\u201d viewed an unfortunate event negatively and often felt as though they were a victim to the situation. This victim mentality made it much harder to see an opportunity that would otherwise be apparent from an unpleasant situation. \n2. With mindset being the first focus, people who considered themselves lucky were generally optimists. By believing that there were opportunities in every circumstance, they were more likely to find those opportunities, and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more self-fulfilling prophecies you have, the more likely you are to BELIEVE in seeing opportunities in negative situations, then the more opportunities you\u2019ll end up seeing, and the more you\u2019ll re-enforce that belief - just strengthening this cycle.\n3. Lucky people were also found to be more willing to try new experiences and add variety to their lives. I\n4. Lucky people were found to be more extroverted, but personally I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the extroversion itself, but more so the ability to connect with others and take risks. This allows the opportunity for more luck to occur, provided you still believe yourself lucky and view the glass half full. \n5. Finally, it\u2019s found that lucky people are more likely to trust their intuition and less likely to be anxious about the situation. Research has shown that anxiety disrupts people\u2019s ability to notice the unexpected because they\u2019re too focused on avoiding the negative than searching out for the positive. Lucky people tend to be more relaxed, and therefore more likely to notice chance opportunities, even when not expecting them.  \n\nSo with that said, and with science and studies out of the way here are my thoughts on it. \n\nFrom the way I see it, we\u2019re all dealt a hand of cards in life. Sometimes we\u2019re dealt with a great deck of aces, other times we\u2019re given shit. Just because you have a solid hand doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019ll win, and just because you have a shitty deck doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll lose. It\u2019s totally up to you to do the best you can, given the circumstance, and take advantage of everything you have within your power. \n\nThe more time you spend working on something, the more opportunity you\u2019ll be exposed to, and the more likely you are to have a positive outcome. \n\nSo for everyone out there\u2026you have the same 24 hours in a day and the same ability to make your own decisions and control how you view things. The glass is always half full and there are opportunities everywhere, it\u2019s just up to you to be open enough to see them :)\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-02-09T23:30:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to invest in real estate","how to buy real estate","how to make passive income","passive income","real estate investment","how to be a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to invest","real estate 101","stock market 101","how to build your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","beatthebush","mike ferry","grant cardone"],"title":"How I just got lucky in Real Estate (The Truth)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kB6Yro-h0GU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kB6Yro-h0GU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kB6Yro-h0GU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kB6Yro-h0GU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kB6Yro-h0GU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"213","dislikeCount":"11","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"716","viewCount":"10556"}},{"id":"iA5FT0l9FZE","snippet":{"description":"Yes, you can actually buy a home in a historic Italian Village known for its fine wines and clean beaches\u2026and the best part, is that you can buy one of these for the cost of a medium fountain drink at McDonalds. With a small catch, of course. Enjoy! Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThese homes are being sold in a small Italian Village among the Mediterranean island of Sardinia. The area boasts zero smog, luxurious beaches, and low crime\u2026seems like a bargain, right? Well, kind of. The population of this town has slowly been dwindling, shrinking from just over 2200 to 1,300 with much of the younger population moving away to more populated areas, and an overwhelming amount of middle-aged, childless couples. This leaves the small town of Ollolai with a plethora of abandoned homes in deteriorating condition, and at risk of one day becoming a ghost town. \n\nSo the solution? Sell the homes to $1 to lure investors in and help revitalize the area and ignite the local economy. But, in order to actually buy a home for $1, you have to agree to a few minor conditions.\n\n1. You have to begin restoring the property within one year. \n2. You also have to finish the renovation within 3 years to make the property habitable.\n3. You need to keep it 5 years before selling. \n\nMany of these homes are stone-built from the natural granite within the hillside\u2026.and oh, they\u2019re over 200 years old. They\u2019re estimating the cost of renovations to be about $25,000-$35,000\u2026but realistically, it might be more depending on how extensive you decide to renovate. \n\nOverall, it seems like a pretty good deal for someone who wants a relaxing vacation home away from the hustle of city life. While we don\u2019t know about their rental rules, this could make an amazing getaway or short term furnished rental to pick up for the all-in cost of a Toyota Prius.\n\nHowever, if something sounds too good to be true\u2026It\u2019s a relatively poor village town. There\u2019s almost non existent trade. There\u2019s not much to do. There\u2019s very little right now to bring in money besides offering $1 homes.  There\u2019s still a very traditional way of life here\u2026shepherds are still making fine cheeses, and artisans are still making woven baskets\u2026there are no apple stores or In-N-Outs\u2026Because it\u2019s so far removed from mainland, getting there isn\u2019t as easy as getting on a bus or train - and bringing in materials will pose its own challenges. \n\nBut, realistically this could be good for someone who doesn\u2019t mind the slow, village life that\u2019s far removed from the city\u2026if so, this could be a steal. I think we\u2019ll start to see more tourism into smaller areas like this as the more populated, well-traveled destinations become too mainstream and lose their authenticity. So long term, this could pan out well!\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-02-07T23:30:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","real estate broker","how to sell real estate","how to make money in real estate","how to buy investment property","passive income","passive income real estate","$1 home for sale","ollolai","how i became a millionaire","how to invest your money","how to make money in stocks","real estate 101","stock market 101","grant cardone","gary vee","tai lopez","real estate coaching","real estate investor","cheapest house"],"title":"The world's cheapest house?

And up. And up. We\u2019ve seen an incredible bull market over the last 8 years so if you\u2019ve been investing for less than that, you\u2019ve never really seen an extended downtown and experienced what that\u2019s like to take a loss.\n\nSecond, is that unless you plan on selling, price fluctuations make zero difference. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s irrelevant. It\u2019s short sighted to point to short term fluctuations in price to determine if something was a good investment or not. Unless your entire goal was to buy and sell in a few weeks or month, the price at that time doesn\u2019t impact you one bit. Instead, the price that matters is what it\u2019ll be by the time you need that money. \n\nEvery market is cyclical and there will be a time when the markets go down and you see some losses for an extended period of time\u2026 It\u2019s totally normal. It\u2019s not a time for you to regret buying in or wishing you would\u2019ve bought the dip. We haven\u2019t seen many losses in the last 8 years, but there have been MANY extended periods of losses and recessions throughout the market\u2019s existence. \n\nAlso, the market just doesn\u2019t move up a set amount every year. For instance, I often mention that the SP500 index has historically returned about 7-8% annually after inflation\u2026this doesn\u2019t mean that it returns that same amount every year. We\u2019ll have bull runs and bear markets\u2026it\u2019s just part of investing.\n \nStatistically, it\u2019s shown that market timing rarely ever works - it\u2019s impossible to know exactly when the market will drop and how low it\u2019ll go, and when the bottom hits to buy back in. \n\nStudies by Brad Barber and Terrance Odean\u00a0find that individual investors experience reduced returns with their stock trading accounts, with increased active trading a key reason in lowering returns. Examining 66,465 US household trading accounts over the 1991 \u2013 1996 period, Barber and Odean find that the average household account earned an annual return of 16.4% over the period, compared to the 17.9% market return. Those households which traded most earned an annual return of 11.4%. They\u2019ve also determined less than 1% of households were able to reliably predict market cycles between 1992-2006. \nhttp:\/\/faculty.haas.berkeley.edu\/odean\/papers%20current%20versions\/behavior%20of%20individual%20investors.pdf\n\nNow speaking of risk and all-time highs in the market, what about a large upfront lump sum investment NOW, or slowly putting it in the market over time? \n\nCharles Shchwab ran the numbers from 1993-2012 for each investment strategy. \nIf you start with $2000 per year available at the beginning of each year, and bought at the YTD low every year, this resulted in $87,004.\nIf you just invest immediately as soon as you have it, you\u2019d have $81,650.\nIf you invested $2000 equally every month over the course of the year, you\u2019d have $79,510\nIf you had bad timing and bought at the YTD high, you\u2019d have $72,487.\nAnd if you had cash investments, you\u2019d be left with $51,291. \nhttps:\/\/www.schwab.com\/resource-center\/insights\/content\/does-market-timing-work\n\nThe study concludes that the most reliable investment method has always been to buy immediately, and hold. Do not try to time the markets. Also according to research conducted by Charles Schwab Company in 2012, between 1926 and 2011, a 20-year holding period never produced a negative result!

Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nAnd as always, I\u2019m primarily a real estate and investing channel and I intend to keep it that way - but I believe much of this ties into investing, wealth building, and investor psychology. So even though I\u2019ll make crypto videos every now and then, especially because I\u2019m invested in it and find it super interesting, it\u2019s not going to be very often unless I feel like there\u2019s something worth mentioning, and today there is.\n\nLet\u2019s first start with one of the more subtle points that many of us can relate to\u2026people are getting impatient and the growth we previously saw was largely unsustainable.  As much as we need it, the WORST thing for cryptocurrency from this standpoint is stability. Stability is boring. Stability isn\u2019t exciting. Stability doesn\u2019t get people talking about it. If people aren\u2019t talking about it, it has a hard time attracting new money - and investors get bored. So what do many of them do? Cash out and look for other opportunities. And what caused this\u2026from my perspective, was lack of utility for the price it was formerly trading at. \n\nThe next, and probably the most impactful is the legal uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency lately. In a speculative market like this, the slightest chance of regulation sends many investors into a state of panic. However, the significance this poses is fear - fear that if one market bans or regulates cryptocurrency, it sets a precedent for others to follow. \n\nThe failing of Bitconnect and other similar coins. This, by itself, isn\u2019t a cause of the recent price drop but more so a symptom of what\u2019s currently allowed and what we can expect to see more of in an unregulated market - which, to me, doesn\u2019t seem sustainable. This leaves me thinking, how long until government steps in to save us from ourselves?\n\nWith the push to regulate these markets comes the requirement for exchanges to verify its users in order to withdraw or move funds, especially in high dollar amounts. It puts many exchanges between a rock and a hard place of operations\u2026again, this isn\u2019t a cause of the recent drop, but a symptom of the current state of the market and the growing pains of legitimizing cryptocurrency. And frankly, I think this is a good sign - this means that cryptocurrency is being taken seriously, it means that the bad apples will be weeded out, and the legitimate coins will have more room to grow.\n\nLastly, I think we\u2019re seeing the appeal of Bitcoin slowly dwindle as Ethereum takes over from a practicality a day-to-day use standpoint.\n\nSo with that said, here\u2019s what this means from my perspective. Even though prices have been depressed, I think this is largely a move in the right direction for cryptocurrency in the LONG TERM. You can\u2019t have shit coins going up 100x in value and millionaires consistently being made overnight. You can\u2019t have people promoting pyramid schemes and profiting without legal repercussions when it fails. You can\u2019t have exchange owners picking up and running away with millions. You can\u2019t have some random people creating their own ICO\u2019s and then cashing out at its peak. And short term investors only in for the quick profit won\u2019t be able to forever turn a profit consistently without losing money at some point. \n\nRealistically, we should care what the prices are a YEAR from now\u2026not what the prices will be like next week. So basically\u2026if the market drops, don\u2019t panic. Let\u2019s not forget that a year ago, Bitcoin was $1000\u2026while past performance doesn\u2019t indicate future results, it does give us perspective to take a step back and realize that in any market, patience is a key takeaway.  And just as a reminder, I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about - this is just a total guess on my end - and obviously for entertainment value ONLY ;)\n\nEarn a FREE stock with Robinhood:\nhttps:\/\/referral.robinhood.com\/grahams106\/\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n(Do not send me random questions here - the youtube comments are best.

Enjoy! Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nLearn my exact strategies to help grow your career as a real estate agent to a six-figure income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and exactly what you can do to begin taking your career to the next level\u2026these strategies took me to $120,000,000 in sales volume: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nIt begins with the following:\nGood credit - Anything above a 740 generally gets the best rates. \n\n2 years worth of tax returns - This shows that your income is consistent and that you\u2019ve built up some work history. \n\nBank Statements and proof of income for the last 2-6 months - this way you can prove how much money you\u2019re actually making and spending. With that, they can calculate what your debt to income ratio is - banks prefer those who save a lot, and spend very little.\n\nCash reserves - sometimes it can be 3-6 months of mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, and a buffer in liquid cash or assets.\n\nPretty much any time you buy real estate, you\u2019ll need a down payment. Banks want to see that you have your own money at risk when you buy a house\u2026this down payment forms your initial equity in the property. Generally 15-20% down is about what I\u2019m seeing. \n\nIf you don\u2019t put down 20%, you\u2019ll generally need to pay PMI which stands for private mortgage insurance. This is an extra cost that helps assure the bank you\u2019ll be making your payments, since the less money you have in the deal, the higher the risk is that the bank will lose money in the event you foreclose. \n\nIf you can qualify lower down payments and the numbers make sense, go for it. But in more expensive markets, you\u2019re going to need more money down. Some other options might be available like a VA loan where you can buy with 0% down - so this will be up to you figure out what\u2019ll be best.\n\nWhen saving for a property, it\u2019s really about setting your priorities and deciding what comes first - if buying a property is your number one priority, it might make sense to cut back in other areas just for the sake of accomplishing this. \n\nWhat I use that helps a lot is Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com - I use these to track all of my expenses. You need to know where every penny is spent and exactly how much you earn. It\u2019ll be nearly impossible to save as much as you can without doing this.\n\nOne other strategy I like to use is to automate my savings. I have one bank account where all of my money is deposited and saved - this is Ally Bank. Then I have a Bank of America account for my expenses. I\u2019ll only transfer a certain amount of money every month to bank of America, this means that everything else I have is pretty much already stashed away. \n\nFinally, generally banks won\u2019t want the mortgage payment to exceed about 44% of your total income after expenses. \n\nAgain, with this, it\u2019s all cutting back as much as you can. You really have to make this a priority to save as much as you can. \n\nNow for those who just don\u2019t earn much money in the first place, the reality is that you\u2019ll need to either cut back on your expenses as much as you can and save the difference - or work to increase your income. There\u2019s no way around it, there\u2019s no way to sugar coat this - if you\u2019re not earning enough money, you\u2019ll need dedicate yourself to making more money. This is one of those things where if you want it bad enough, you will somehow find a way to make it happen. \n\nNow one more thing I do when it comes to saving is to keep it all in a high interest savings account. Most people want to invest it, although in the short term, there could be too much volatility to risk it in the markets. \n\nUltimately, when saving up for a down payment, it really just comes down to income vs expenses - and once that\u2019s handled, banks will look at the bigger picture to determine what you\u2019d be qualified to receive. And patience and discipline here goes a long way - you will need to do this long term consistently. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-30T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to save for a house","dave ramsey","beatthebush","how to save for a house downpayment","how to save for a house fast","how to save for a house in a year","how to buy a house","how to buy a house with bad credit","how to own real estate","how to invest in real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate agent","grant cardone","biggerpockets","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 2018","real estate strategies","bryan casella","real estate millionaire"],"title":"How To Save For A House (Plus EVERYTHING else you'll need to know)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qyQOoCmamIk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qyQOoCmamIk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qyQOoCmamIk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qyQOoCmamIk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qyQOoCmamIk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2189","dislikeCount":"384","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"38637","viewCount":"946232"}},{"id":"QOLKNkMZ2eU","snippet":{"description":"I generally don\u2019t have many regrets, but this is the one investment property that got away that I wish I bought\u2026and how you can avoid my same mistake.

Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nLearn my exact strategies to help grow your career as a real estate agent to a six-figure income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and exactly what you can do to begin taking your career to the next level\u2026these strategies took me to $120,000,000 in sales volume: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\n*This is not investment advice, it\u2019s purely my opinion, don\u2019t listen to some random dude on the internet, and this is all for entertainment purposes only ;) \n\nThese would be my personal top 5 ways to invest your first $10,000 to get the most bang for the buck:\n\nThe first option could be to invest in a tax advantaged account like a Roth IRA or 401k. This would give you the one of the highest IMMEDIATE benefits of just about any other option you could take at the beginning. A Roth IRA is an account where you contribute your after-tax money, and your money grows tax-free until your 59.5. At that time, you can pull out all of your profit without paying any taxes on the gains.  You also have the option of investing within a 401k\u2026this is where you contribute money before you pay any taxes on it, it\u2019s deducted from your total earned income that year, and you won\u2019t pay taxes on that income. Both of these options would give you a really solid foundation long term. This is a set it and forget it strategy. \n\nThe second option to invest $10,000 would be individual stocks. Even though I\u2019m personally not a fan of investing in individual stocks and I\u2019d rather go for an index for simplicity\u2019s sake, $10,000 is enough to see some really great returns if you\u2019re an experienced trader or can pick well-performing companies and stocks. It\u2019ll likely be better to invest in individual stocks within a tax advantaged account like an IRA or 401k, but you can play around with it in a taxable trading account and have access to your money whenever you want it. This would be a solid option for anyone looking to invest $10,000 and doesn\u2019t mind researching and trading stocks - it can actually be pretty fun if you\u2019re making money. \n \nThe third option is - REAL ESTATE. FYI: it\u2019ll be hard to invest in real estate with only $10,000 unless you buy something in a very, very cheap part of the country - at which case, I\u2019d recommend you also have some savings built up besides the $10,000 because things can and will break. But more realistically, a better option for $10,000 might be through a REIT. This stands for a real estate investment trust - these are companies that own a large portfolio of real estate, and you can buy in for pretty much any amount - often times the returns are given through dividends, which can be pretty decent. However, just be mindful of how these dividends are taxed - often times REIT dividends are taxed as ordinary income instead of long term capital games, so it\u2019s much more beneficial to hold REIT within a tax-advantaged account to avoid paying more than you should. But REITs can be a great exposure to real estate without any work and minimal money. \n\nThe fourth suggestion might be to invest $10,000 into starting your own business. Really with this, the sky is the limit and you can make $10,000 go a long way. $10,000 could really be a good amount to buy the equipment you need, buy the advertising you need, set everything up - and begin making money. From everything on this list, starting a business would likely have the highest potential to make a TON of money - or the highest amount to lose it all. Just depends what type of business, how well you know it, and how dedicated you are to making it happen.\n\nThe fifth and final way to invest $10,000 is probably the most practical, but also the least exciting\u2026but I\u2019d put a big emphasis of using $10,000 and first paying down any high interest debt. By doing this, you\u2019re pretty much just getting a guaranteed return at whatever the interest rate is. Before doing any of the above, make sure to pay off high interest debt that might be weighing you down. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-26T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest 10000","best ways to invest 10000","best ways to invest money 2018","how to invest 2018","how to make money in 2018","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in the stock market","investing 10000 in stock market","how to make money in real estate","investing 101","investing in real estate 101","real estate agent 101","real estate investing 101","ryan scribner","financial education"],"title":"How to Invest: The BEST ways to invest $10,000 in 2018","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RDsnPYzwmnE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RDsnPYzwmnE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RDsnPYzwmnE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RDsnPYzwmnE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RDsnPYzwmnE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M36S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"474","dislikeCount":"64","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2994","viewCount":"96360"}},{"id":"DvhQIbrSh2s","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found helps the most when it comes to how to be confident in life, business, and why this ends up also making you more money.

As we know, we don\u2019t get what we want\u2026we get what we are.\n\nThese are the 5 most practical steps to gaining more confidence over time:\n\nForce yourself to do things that make you uncomfortable. You\u2019re not going to grow as a person until you do this. If you\u2019re scared of doing something, just do it. The whole point of this is to begin rewiring your brain to realize that you can put yourself in uncomfortable situations and nothing bad happens. You\u2019ll slowly become more accustomed to thinking\u2026I did something I was scared of\u2026nothing bad happened\u2026I felt better about doing something\u2026I feel better knowing that I have control over my life and I make my own decisions\u2026and I become more secure in myself. Keep doing this consistently. \n\nEye contact. This is a tough one, but it\u2019s important. People who are confident have no problem looking someone in the eye - it shows that you\u2019re sure of yourself and believe what you\u2019re speaking. You become more controlled and purposeful in your entire attitude. Try practicing this. Next time you\u2019re talking to someone, look them in the eye for as long as you can. Try for them to break eye contact first. It\u2019s difficult in the beginning, but you\u2019ll get better over time - and again, when you can look someone in the eye and tell them something - you will feel more in control. \n\nBe yourself. Most people are walking around projecting an image they feel other people will like and accept. But these people aren\u2019t the ones who command respect and have presence. The thing is, we all wish we could just truly be ourselves\u2026flaws and all\u2026and we ENVY others who just seem to be \u201cthem.\u201d What I\u2019ve found is that the more \u201cyou\u201d you are, the more people ADMIRE that about you, and the more confident you become because you don\u2019t have the \u201cfront\u201d of trying to conform to what people think they want.\n\nAccept that people will not like you. Sometimes you want to appeal to everyone - you don\u2019t want anyone to dislike you, you want everyone to like you\u2026you\u2019re operating in the safe zone\u2026but in the process, you end up not winning anyone because people don\u2019t feel STRONGLY about you. The reality is that you will NEVER be able to win everyone, so don\u2019t try. Be polarizing. Accept that people won\u2019t like you and that\u2019s OKAY\u2026it\u2019s a GOOD THING! Be happy someone actually doesn\u2019t like you, because it\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nFEAR REGRET. Most people have the fear of loss\u2026this is more powerful than the fear of gain. Tell someone \u201cYou could loss $100 or gain $100\u201d\u2026most people care more about holding on to what they have than to avoid losing it. But shift your mindset to fear of REGRET\u2026imagine your loss is really your POTENTIAL. You LOSE OUT on being that person you COULD be, but your fear held you back. So the only thing you\u2019re losing out if everything you COULD get if you tried. Think of that every time you\u2019re afraid of losing something by playing it safe\u2026don\u2019t play it safe.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-23T22:00:02Z","tags":["How to boost your confidence","how to be confident","how to be confident in yourself","how to be confident around people","how to be confident in an interview","practical psychology","how to boost your confidence in speaking","how to feel more confident about yourself","how to feel more confident at work","how to make money","how to make money online","self help motivation","7 habits of high effective people","how to get your life together","how to invest in real estate","real estate agent"],"title":"How to BOOST your Confidence in 5 Steps","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvhQIbrSh2s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvhQIbrSh2s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvhQIbrSh2s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvhQIbrSh2s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DvhQIbrSh2s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M14S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"260","dislikeCount":"14","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1142","viewCount":"16321"}},{"id":"UP3nuSiBuJ4","snippet":{"description":"I\u2019ve always wanted a Lamborghini, but I\u2019ve also always taken the financially responsible route and invested instead.

This has worked amazingly well over the past 8+ years. However, I\u2019ve set a goal to buy the Lamborghini this year\u2026and now that I have the money to finally make the purchase, I\u2019m wondering if this is the financially sound decision to make, given that interest rates are still low for real estate.\n\nMy concern is that this will be the last chance to buy real estate sub 5% interest rate. However, as interest rates rise, I\u2019m unsure about how much higher real estate will be rising over the next 3 years. Due to increased inventory + rising interest rates, I think we\u2019ll see some more moderate growth - and in some markets, maybe some flattening depending how much inventory comes up. Given that, it also seems like the opportunity cost of owning a Gallardo or SLS AMG for 2 years won\u2019t be that big, and I\u2019d be able to get back in after a year or so with minimal \u201closs.\u201d \n\nBut with that, I\u2019ll likely be paying a higher interest rate - which may impact what I could buy down the line, especially as Los Angeles Real Estate Prices are already barely cash flowing. But from a branding perspective, a Lamborghini could end up a great asset - plus I can own the car I\u2019ve always wanted to have. \n\nSo this is the internal debate\u2026if you didn\u2019t want the video, you probably should because I go into way more detail about the housing index, real estate prices, and analyzing the car vs a house. It\u2019s worth it, I promise ;) Thanks for watching\/reading! \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-21T22:30:01Z","tags":["house or lamborghini","lamborghini gallardo","gallardo superleggera","gallardo performante","mercedes sls amg","sls amg","real estate 101","real estate prices","real estate investing","how to make money in real estate","investing in real estate","investing in real estate for beginners","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate agent day in the life","should i buy a house or lamborghini","investing in real estate at a young age","real estate investing 101","real estate agent career"],"title":"27 Years Old: Should I buy a House or a Lamborghini?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UP3nuSiBuJ4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UP3nuSiBuJ4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UP3nuSiBuJ4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UP3nuSiBuJ4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UP3nuSiBuJ4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1279","dislikeCount":"58","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1331","viewCount":"37596"}},{"id":"CR3zm9MYxhE","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s a common questions I\u2019m asked\u2026is it better to lease or buy a car, and which one is a financially better move? I\u2019ve done both, and these are my thoughts as to which one is better - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe short answer is that it really depends on your situation and how long you plan to keep the car, but I\u2019ll describe the pros and cons of each and what might work best with you. \n\nLets start with owning and buying a car. First of all, you can buy pretty much whatever car you want, unlike leasing where it\u2019s almost always a new or newer car. Generally, unless you just buy your car outright in cash, you\u2019ll end up financing the car. This is when you take the cost of the car, minus your down payment, and get a loan which you\u2019ll pay off over a specific period of time - the most common being 48-72 months. And then you\u2019ll also pay whatever state sales tax is on top of your purchase. Factor all that in\u2026and then once you pay off your loan, congratulations - you own the car free and clear.  And then when you go to sell it, you\u2019ll get whatever price the car is worth - minus whatever you might still owe on the car. \n\nHowever, a few drawbacks of this -  unless under warranty, you\u2019ll generally be responsible for maintenance and wear and tear items during your ownership, especially on an older car, and this can add to the cost\u2026you\u2019ll also need to pay sales tax on the purchase price upfront\u2026and totally separate from that, your monthly payments tend to be higher with owning than with leasing. \n\nLeasing generally works best if you\u2019re the type of person who always wants to have a newer car every few years. If you plan to get one car and drive it forever to the ground\u2026 don\u2019t lease your car. But depending on how long you plan to keep the car, leasing could actually save you money. With leasing, you\u2019ll generally be leasing a brand new or newer car. You\u2019ll usually have a down payment and then generally you\u2019ll have a 24-36 month term where you have a fixed monthly payment, along with a set number of miles you can drive each year. You\u2019ll need to return the car with your set amount of miles or less or risk paying fees and penalties. \n\nNow when you lease a car, you\u2019re not paying the full amount of sales tax upfront - which can save you a TON of money. The lease price is determined but the depreciation the car is going to see during ownership, plus some finance charges. You\u2019re basically just paying a monthly amount of the depreciation, rather than the entire cost of the car. Therefore, with leases, you\u2019ll generally pay LESS per month to drive the car because your financing only the deprecation\u2026not the entire thing like when owning a car. With a lot of leases, too, maintenance is often covered\u2026so you can pretty much just pay a set monthly price and not have to worry about normal wear and tear\/maintenance costs that come up. And when the lease is done, you don\u2019t have the hassle of needing to sell it\u2026you just turn it back and you\u2019re done. \n\nSo here\u2019s my thoughts. Both leasing and owning have their own advantages and disadvantages, and what makes one better than the other is dependent on your situation. If you plan to keep your car more than 5 years or so\u2026it\u2019s almost always better to buy the car. Whether you buy a brand new car or an old used one, the longer you plan to keep the car, the more it starts making sense to buy it.\n\nBut if you\u2019re like me and you want the privilege of owning a new car every few years\u2026 it\u2019s cheaper just to lease it - it means I pay less per month since I\u2019m only paying for the depreciation, I don\u2019t need to pay sales tax on the entire cost of the car - only on my monthly payment, and I can simply swap it out when the lease is done to get a new one. \n\nIdeally, for most people out there who just need a car to get from A to B\u2026the BEST option is to buy a car that\u2019s 3-5 years old and has already hit most of its depreciation. After about 5 years, most cars depreciate at a much, much slower pace - so buying a car like this and keeping it forever would be the most financially \u201csane\u201d thing to do. Then just finance it at a low interest rate, re-invest whatever money you would\u2019ve spent on the car, and hold it. Then when the car falls apart and you can\u2019t drive it anymore, do it again. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-19T22:30:00Z","tags":["buy or lease a car","buy vs lease a car","buy or lease a car dave ramsey","should i buy or lease a car","leasing vs buying a car","should you buy or lease a new car","car leasing","car leasing explained","car leasing tips","car leasing vs buying","car leasing 101","car buying 101","car leasing secrets","car buying secrets","car buying tips","car buying","car buying guide","car buying strategies","lease negotiation strategies","how to save money","lease vs finance","lease a car","buy a car"],"title":"Buying vs Leasing a Car 101: How to pick the BEST choice","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CR3zm9MYxhE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CR3zm9MYxhE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CR3zm9MYxhE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CR3zm9MYxhE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CR3zm9MYxhE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1264","dislikeCount":"316","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"18383","viewCount":"518003"}},{"id":"5Zqvhh0VHtg","snippet":{"description":"This is exactly how Aryan got 500 listings as a 22-year-old part time real estate agent, while still in school!

There will always be extremes on either side, high school graduates making millions and college graduates working minimum wage\u2026so I picked the average for everything:\n\nAverage college degree:\nAverage cost of a 4-year education: $56,840\nAverage amount of student debt - $37,172\nAverage interest rate - 4.8%\nAverage income - $50,556\nAverage lifetime earning potential  - $2,268,000\n\nAverage high school degree:\nAverage high school Income: $35,256 pre tax\nAverage lifetime earning potential: $1,304,000\n\nThis appears to be a difference of $964,000 earned over a lifetime between a high school and college graduate.\n\nWith our average college graduate, they begin working at 22 years old earning $50,556. After taxes, that\u2019ll be more like $42,000 per year. If they pay down their loan by $10,000 per year, by the age of 26, the loans are paid off entirely. Now after this, lets assume that now at the age of 27, the college graduate invests 25% of their net salary and invests it at an 8% return. We\u2019ll average this at $15,000 per year overall - we can assume salaries will go up over time and investing remaining consistent. That\u2019ll leave $3,569,118.32 in net worth by the age of 65 years old. \n\nBut with the High School Graduate: They\u2019re making just over $35,000 per year but no debt. Plus they can start working and investing immediately. Lets assume after taxes, they\u2019re left with $30,000 per year and they invest the same 25% of their income, or $7500 per year. And lets assume this remains consistent over the course of their entire career.  Even though they\u2019re making an investing less, they have an extra 4 years of work and saving over the college graduate, while also having zero debt. Even though they\u2019re earning and investing less, by the age of 65, they\u2019re left with $3,668,491.23.\n\nThat just happens to be $99,373 dollars MORE than the college graduate at the age of retirement. \n\nLets then say the college graduate pays for college outright without any debt, and begins investing $15,000 per year from the age of 23 vs 27, so that\u2019s an extra 4 years. Do that until the age of 65, you\u2019ll now have $4,928,745.08. Just incurring debt early on, and postponing investing just a few years made a difference of nearly $1.3 MILLION dollars over the course of the career. That\u2019s huge.\n\nThen lets also say that the high school graduate just invests the cost of a college degree at 18\u2026actually, we\u2019ll go even further to say he just invests the average college debt of $37,172 at the age of 18, then just invests $7500 per year after that by investing 25% of their income. By 65, that person will have 5,052,479.59\u2026.that\u2019s a $123,734 difference in net worth at the age of retirement of 65 between a high school graduate and college graduate. \n\nThat\u2019s an extra $123,000\u2026just by not going to college? \n\nNow of course, I\u2019m making this video more so for entertainment purposes to run the numbers behind the real cost a college degree, and also to show that purely from a financial perspective, college doesn\u2019t always make sense. In terms of wealth, it really boils down to is two things: 1. How long you invest your money for 2. How much of that you invest. It\u2019s that simple. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-14T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","is college worth it","college vs high school","real estate investing 101","how to become a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","is college necessary","is college a waste of time","is college worth the cost","investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2018","college vs trade school","tai lopez"],"title":"How to earn an EXTRA $100,000...By not going to College?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N9CNwrH2iyU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N9CNwrH2iyU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N9CNwrH2iyU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N9CNwrH2iyU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N9CNwrH2iyU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M27S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"363","dislikeCount":"29","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"616","viewCount":"14762"}},{"id":"mmusZ66uH7A","snippet":{"description":"If you\u2019ve been thinking about investing in real estate but not quite sure where to start, start here.

When done correctly, this could eliminate all of your housing costs, allowing you to live for free in the property - plus you\u2019re investing your money in real estate and building equity, and depending on the area, sometimes you can even make a little profit each month at the same time. \n\nPlus by buying the property as a primary residence, you can quality for much better loan terms and lower down payment than if you were just buying an investment property - which allows you a little more flexibility and leverage on your money. \n\nNow if it sounds too good to be true, kinda\u2026 there\u2019s a bit of a catch - you\u2019ll need a down payment. You might be able to qualify for low down payment amounts, but I\u2019m generally seeing most people needing to put around 15-20% down. You\u2019ll also need a stable income, meaning you\u2019ll likely need two years of tax returns. And you\u2019ll also need a good credit score. Those three things will need to be in order for you to do this. \n\nVideo summed up:\n1. Start where you live. Unlike investing out of area, when you invest near where you live, you already know which areas are good and bad. You can see firsthand which areas are improving the most. Which areas people want to live in. Where the most demand is. Where businesses and people are moving to. It\u2019s this knowledge that gives you a huge advantage over everywhere else where you might not be as familiar.\n2. Buy something that needs work. As a beginner, I recommend finding something that just needs to be cosmetically updated - these are often easy, surface-level repairs that can be done in a few weeks or months that have a pretty good ROI. It just means re-doing floors, re-painting, light landscaping, maybe updating a kitchen or bathroom\u2026very easy things that most contractors will be capable of doing. \n3. Understand cash flow and which properties make sense to buy. Most places will not work. Understand everything about cash flow, building up equity, tax write offs, and your net return after expenses. \n4. Buy a multi-family property that needs minor cosmetic work. \n5. Renovate it and by doing so, you\u2019ll usually end up building extra\n6. Rent out the other units and live in one of them yourself\n7. After a few years, buy another multi-family building and rent the unit you were living in\n8. Continue repeating this process every several years, building up a portfolio of investment real estate.\n9. PROFIT. \n\nThanks so much for watching!

Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales:  https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nSo here\u2019s why I\u2019m a million dollars in debt - there\u2019s a big difference between good debt and bad debt. The reality is that almost every successful business, at some point, needs leverage if it\u2019s to grow exponentially\u2026especially in real estate\u2026and how you manage debt could either make or ruin you. Think of debt a like fire. Fire could give you warmth, cook your food, bring you light\u2026or it could burn you. Debt is very similar. \n\nI grew up in a family that was wrecked by debt\u2026I grew up thinking debt was awful and that credit cards were the worst thing ever. But as I began to associate with people who were just insanely wealthy, I realized\u2026these were people who weren\u2019t afraid of debt. They embraced it and worked the system to their advantage. \n\nBad debt: This is when borrow money to buy stupid things that depreciate in value and doesn\u2019t make you money. I shouldn\u2019t even need to explain it because this is pretty self explanatory. \n\nGood debt is money that you borrow to make you more money. Good debt is used as a tool to increase your cash flow by borrowing money at a cheaper rate than your money makes you. And right now, we\u2019re at the end of an opportunity of borrowing cheap money - that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to grab as much as I can while rates are still overall relatively low. \n\nThis is why I\u2019m over a million dollars in debt\u2026I have one 30-year loan at 3.375% interest rate, and another one at 4.5% interest rate\u2026my investments make way more than this, and I\u2019m able to profit the difference. It allows me to invest way more long term and increase my cash flow. This is also why there\u2019s absolutely no reason for me to pay this down early\u2026I can pretty much invest my money anywhere and get higher than a 4.5% return, so it makes sense to invest my money than pay down low-interest, tax deductible debt. \n\nSo what does this mean for YOU and how can this help YOU?\n\nKnowing the difference between good and bad debt will help you evaluate what you can do to maximize your profits and the amount of money you make. If you\u2019re borrowing $10,000 at a 5% interest rate, but your money is making you 10% elsewhere\u2026that\u2019s a no brainer. Borrow the money, make 10%, pay 5% in interest, and you\u2019ve just got a \u201cFree\u201d 5% without using your own money. This is basic real estate 101, but it also applies to just about any business.\n\nThe tricky part, from my perspective, is when you start borrowing money in the 6%+ bracket. The higher your interest rate, the tighter the margins, and the more closely you need to evaluate if it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re borrowing in the higher tiers, you need to be absolutely sure you\u2019ll be making a higher return and that it\u2019s sustainable\u2026at a certain point, it becomes more advantageous to pay down debt than re-invest. If I had an 8% loan, you bet I\u2019d be aggressively paying that down as much as I can\u2026but a 3.375% loan like I have on one of my homes? Nope. Keep it forever. \n\nSo if you get to the point where you need to grow your business or if you decide to invest in real estate, know that debt CAN be good when managed appropriately\u2026it\u2019s a little like playing with fire, as I mentioned earlier. Used appropriately, it\u2019s great\u2026and it\u2019s how I\u2019ve been able to get some pretty good returns in real estate. \nSo don\u2019t be afraid of debt, but manage it carefully and consider what your money is really worth! \n\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-07T23:30:01Z","tags":["one million in debt","graham stephan debt","good debt vs bad debt","robert kiyosaki","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate investing","how to make money in real estate","how to invest in real estate","other peoples money","real estate investing for beginners","real estate license","how to sell real estate","how to make passive income","real estate 101","real estate agent 101","davey ramsey","tai lopez","credit cards 101","how to be a real estate agent","how to be a millionaire"],"title":"I\u2019m over $1 MILLION in Debt (Lessons of Leverage in Business and Real Estate)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l3jlFZ4XMUo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l3jlFZ4XMUo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l3jlFZ4XMUo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l3jlFZ4XMUo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l3jlFZ4XMUo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M50S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1739","dislikeCount":"243","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10854","viewCount":"161005"}},{"id":"059l8V6NOGQ","snippet":{"description":"Because there are so many different investing options you can take, these are the most important points that can apply to just about anything you invest in.

The second best time is right now. This is one of the biggest advantages you have of being young is that you have the power of time, and the longer you invest - the more money you make. Consider this\u2026if you invest $1000 per year at an 8% return beginning at the age of 16, you\u2019ll have $616,000 by the time you\u2019re 65. If you invest the same $1000 per year at an 8% interest but you started at 30 years old instead of 16\u2026you\u2019ll only have $200,800. That means that each year between the ages of 16 and 30 is worth over $29,000\u2026for every $1000 you invested early on. \n\nThe second is to re-invest often. \nThis plays off the first point in terms of compounded interest. In fact, this point is so important that Albert Einstein called it \u201cthe 8th wonder of the world.\u201d The whole premise here is that your money makes you more money, that then makes you more money.\n\nThe third is to invest long term.\nThis is my biggest philosophy when it comes to investing. Some people are traders - where their goal is to get in and out and make a profit. I\u2019m not one of them, and I prefer to buy it once and forget about it. It\u2019s statistically proven that overall, market timing doesn\u2019t work and time in the market makes the biggest difference. And if you do that, this is crucial - having a short term outlook doesn\u2019t really provide enough time to recover from a market downturn or correction. Overall, things will never move in a straight line up - it\u2019s often up and down along the way, but the overall trend is increasing. This is why it\u2019s important to have a long term outlook. For myself, I don\u2019t care what prices are like 5 years from now - or 15 years from now. I just care that they\u2019ll be much, much higher 30-40 years from now. If I\u2019m not planning to touch that money or do anything with it, I pretend like it doesn\u2019t exist and I\u2019m packing it away for the future. \n\nThe fourth is to diversify. \nDon\u2019t have all of your eggs in one basket. This is less about maximizing your returns, and more about loss avoidance. In the small chance things don\u2019t work out, you won\u2019t be out of luck. Sure, you COULD possibly hit it big with one amazing investment, or you could risk it all if it fails. When it comes to investing, it\u2019s important to diversify your holdings between investments and cash. \n\nThe fifth is to do your research. \nHonestly the worst investment you do is the one you don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s how you end up losing money. It\u2019s so important that you understand what you\u2019re investing in, why you\u2019ve invested in it, and have a strategy in place. Never invest blindly and do not take advice blindly or take random advice from people on the internet. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-03-05T23:30:00Z","tags":["investing strategies","investing strategies for beginners","investing strategy for stock market","investing strategy for real estate","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate coach","how i became a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","passive income","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","how to invest","how to make money in real estate","how to invest your money","how to make money online","tai lopez","gary vee","grant cardone","bryan casella"],"title":"The 5 Investing Strategies to make the MOST Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/059l8V6NOGQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/059l8V6NOGQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/059l8V6NOGQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/059l8V6NOGQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/059l8V6NOGQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"329","dislikeCount":"15","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"981","viewCount":"21830"}},{"id":"nat6F3kcfpY","snippet":{"description":"This is how I made over $73,000 working as a Real Estate Agent just by having the patience to wait 90 minutes.

Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\n1. The first, and probably biggest one is living above your means and living a lifestyle that you can\u2019t afford. This is also probably the most common one I see - and it\u2019s easy to get carried away. It\u2019s also easy to fall into this if everyone around you is spending money to the point where you feel compelled to spend more than you normally would, so you\u2019re not left out. While you shouldn\u2019t necessarily hold yourself back for fear of spending money, you shouldn\u2019t be worried about saying \u2019no\u2019 if you really can\u2019t afford something. Make sure you have a 3-6 month emergency fund saved up so you have a cushion in case something happens, and do your best to manage your expenses. And remember to always live within or below your means - you can always increase your spending later if you really want, but that\u2019s easier to do once you already have a healthy savings.\n\n2. The second mistake I see so many people making is not building up their credit score. Building up your credit as early as you can will give you a significant advantage later on if you ever decide to buy a house or invest in real estate, buy or lease a car, rent an apartment, or finance just about everything. This doesn\u2019t mean you need to spend any more than you normally would, or you need to go in debt just to improve your credit score\u2026just treat the credit card exactly like it\u2019s an extension of your cash. When you\u2019re over the age of 18, just go and get a secured credit card. Don\u2019t get carried away, you don\u2019t need to charge thousands on the card, just gas or food money every now and then and you\u2019re good. \n\n3. The third mistake is when people just wait around, expecting something to magically happen to them. The realization is that nothing will happen if you don\u2019t take the initiative to make it happen. And it\u2019s sad that most people aren\u2019t taught how to actually go after what they want\u2026in school, you\u2019re told exactly what you need to do and when you need to do it by. But in life, no one expects you to do anything, and you won\u2019t get handed anything. I see too many people just waiting for the right opportunities to come along, but they don\u2019t do anything to actively seek out those opportunities. If you want something to happen, YOU will need to make it happen - YOU will need to be the one to decide what you want and how you will get there. \n\n4. The 4th mistake I see if people being too afraid to take chances. Your 20\u2019s are a time where you can AFFORD to take risks and be okay, because with each failure comes with the knowledge and experience of what not to do. Sometimes you\u2019ll just need to take the leap of faith to pursue something and your 20\u2019s is the perfect time to do that\u2026before you\u2019re tied down, before you\u2019re married, before you have kids, before you have too much to lose\u2026take the riskier career option. Start your business. Don\u2019t be stupid, of course, but you can afford more risk in your 20\u2019s than you can in your 50\u2019s. \n\n5. Stay healthy. Stay in shape. Exercise. Get enough sleep every night. Take care of yourself. When you take care of yourself, you\u2019ll be sharper, you\u2019ll make more money, you\u2019ll be happier, and you\u2019ll live longer.

It was a sense of accomplishment. In terms of achieving a goal, it felt good - but nothing changed. I don\u2019t buy designer clothes. I don\u2019t travel first class. I don\u2019t eat out at expensive restaurants. I buy most of my clothes on Black Friday sales. I shop around for the best deals. I make eggs for dinner. I don\u2019t buy anything I don\u2019t need. I keep my expenses low\u2026and that\u2019s how I like it. And it was these habits that made me a millionaire in the first place.\n\nThe biggest aspect of hitting this milestone was a sense of freedom. It was the freedom of knowing that as long as I had this money invested, I\u2019d never have to work a job I disliked and I\u2019d never have to do anything I really didn\u2019t want to do. Just knowing that you could decide to pursue anything is just as enjoyable as pursuing anything. Once you have the freedom or choice to walk away, it leaves you in a position of being the decision-maker in life. And just as a byproduct of that, you tend to enjoy things more and coincidentally, you tend to do better and make more money.  \n\nBut now lets talk about the bad\u2026just kidding, there is no bad ;) But ok in all seriousness\u2026\n\nIt took me awhile to think of this part, because I haven\u2019t really noticed any downsides yet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been at quite the level where money really has a big impact negatively, so I had to stretch this a little just to come up with something\u2026\n\nThe first is that I\u2019ve gotten used to a larger-than-normal income, so it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot me. What I consider a bad month of income could be someone else\u2019s best month ever, and it\u2019s difficult to put that in perspective when you\u2019re used to earning a certain amount, and everyone you\u2019re around earns a certain amount, and you lose touch of what\u2019s normal.\n\nOn the other hand, because I never really \u201cspend\u201d my money, my tolerance for what I consider \u201ca lot\u201d is really, really low\u2026so even though my income is high, the idea of spending $35 on a dinner just seems absurd to me. Or spending more than $20 on gas at a time just seems like a waste\u2026and this is because even though my income went up, I\u2019d get used to it, but I\u2019ve kept my spending at the exact same level as when I was 20 or so. So there\u2019s a big disconnect between what I consider a lot in \u201cincome,\u201d and what I consider a lot in \u201cspending.\u201d But if I didn\u2019t have those frugal spending habits to begin with, I wouldn\u2019t have saved and invested so much, so it was a bit of a necessity. \n\nWhich brings me to my second point\u2026one thing that comes up that sometimes annoys me is that frugality is now somehow frowned upon once you can afford something. Like if I\u2019ll go out and only order one drink because I don\u2019t want to spend the extra money, I get the \u201coh dude, just get another, you can afford it.\u201d But the only reason I got to this place was because I was hyper-focused on my money and how I spent it. If I ever resist spending money, I\u2019m somehow cheap. There\u2019s a reason why lotto winners go broke\u2026the spending habits to become a millionaire are the exact same to STAY a millionaire. \n\nBut besides those few small things, really, nothing changed. I didn\u2019t change my spending habits, it was really quite uneventful. In fact, I\u2019m sure it\u2019d be rather disappointing for anyone who expects there to be some magic thing that happens once you cross the million dollar mark. The reality is that you hit it, you figure you\u2019re doing something right, so you continue to do what works while building up a bigger nest egg. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-27T22:30:00Z","tags":["what its like to be a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to become a millionaire","What it's REALLY like to be a millionaire","the millionaire fastlane","millionaire lifestyle","how to make a million dollars","millionaire real estate agent","millionaire in real estate","millionaire realtor","millionaire real estate investor","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","real estate investing 2018","grant cardone","project life mastery"],"title":"What it's ACTUALLY like to be a Millionaire in your 20's","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aGyiMPdnjUI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aGyiMPdnjUI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aGyiMPdnjUI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aGyiMPdnjUI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aGyiMPdnjUI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M17S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1483","dislikeCount":"129","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5217","viewCount":"112706"}},{"id":"yiCw9Z6swAU","snippet":{"description":"This is something I catch myself doing ALL THE TIME so I thought I\u2019d share - this simple change in perspective can really help to take it to the next level when it comes to growing your money.

So that $100 pair of shoes I could\u2019ve bought is worth $500 extra as a purchase price in real estate. Or the $130,000 I just pulled out as equity from a renovation equals an extra $650,000 in property. \n\nAnd this can be viewed in EVERYTHING. So you get the idea\u2026basically, if you\u2019re ever going to invest your real estate\u2026you\u2019re $1 is never worth $1. It\u2019s really worth $5 invested in Real Estate. And once you see this, you won\u2019t look at $1 the same way ever again. And when you put things in this perspective, your money suddenly has a lot more significance and impact. \n\nJust as one quick example using dollar amounts to show the important of leverage in Real Estate:\nYou have a $100,000 Home that makes a 6% net return after all expenses, which works out to $6000 per year\nYou put $20,000 as a down payment\nYou finance $80,000 at a 4% interest rate\n\nWithin 12 months, you earned:\n$6000 Profit from Rent\nYou paid a total of $4,572 in mortgage payments \nYou paid down your loan by a total of $1408\nYour pet profit was $1428 in rent and $1408 in equity by paying down the loan\n\nThis means your $20,000 just made you $1428 in cash, which is a 7.14% return, and 1408 in equity, a 7% return\u2026\nBringing your total \u201cROI\u201d at a 14.14% return your first year. \n\nHad you bought the property outright in cash, your return would\u2019ve been 6%\u2026so just by leveraging your money, you more than doubled your return for the money you invested. This is the power of using long term, low-interest rate debt when investing. This is also why, in real estate, you should look at every single dollar you have as ACTUALLY being worth $5\u2026because this is how much it\u2019s truly worth. So start looking at your money the same way, it\u2019s really worth 5x more than you think it is. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-25T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing 2018","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing strategy","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","grant cardone","how to make money in real estate","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate","real estate agent training","life hack","how I became a millionaire","how to make passive income","passive income 2018","ryan scribner","investing 101","graham stephan"],"title":"Why your $1 is REALLY worth $5 (Real Estate Investing Mind Trick)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yiCw9Z6swAU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yiCw9Z6swAU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yiCw9Z6swAU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yiCw9Z6swAU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yiCw9Z6swAU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT6M18S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"363","dislikeCount":"24","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1710","viewCount":"23813"}},{"id":"Zk1ZBLKjXs0","snippet":{"description":"The Pareto\u00a0principle\u00a0(aka\u00a080\/20 rule) suggests that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. Here\u2019s how I maximized this to increase my income and work LESS at the same time - enjoy! Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nLearn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGiven the 80\/20 rule, you generally will find that you spend 80% of your time chasing that extra 20% of result. In THEORY, you should be able to do 20% of what you\u2019re doing now and still get 80% of the result. \n\nSo that\u2019s what I did. I looked past all of my clients since the BEGINNING of my career and found the commonalities between the clients that produced the most income vs the ones that took up the most time. I found that I spent 80% of my time chasing little lease deals between $3000-$6000 per month that paid very poorly, and that was consuming most of my time. But even though my motto was \u201cwork with these people, eventually they\u2019ll refer you more business which leads to the 80% of my income\u201d\u2026 but I found that overall, those were the clients that generally didn\u2019t buy after a few years and didn\u2019t refer me business. Instead, I found my clients that were spending $8000-$30,000 per month were the ones that would end up buying and referring me the business that led to much larger commissions, not the lower end price ranges. \n\nSo what did I do? I turned down every lease under $8000 per month. I stopped going after those listings and I stopped working with those clients - that freed up 80% of my day. I then focused that remaining 80% of my time on meeting more clients in the $8000-$20,000 price point that were statistically more likely to lead to more income and more business. And that one difference alone worked\u2026I made an extra $50,000 JUST from that one change, while also working less. \n\nThe next year, the same thing\u2026but I took it a step further. I stopped taking listings that were overpriced. I stopped working with buyers who had unrealistic expectations that I couldn\u2019t change. I focused my time on ONLY working with the people who were ready and realistic. By focusing only on those, it freed up more of my time to focus on meeting MORE people that fit that bill. And guess what? My income went up ANOTHER $50,000 per year, and I worked less. And the less I worked, the less stressed out I was, and the less stressed out I was, the better I did with my clients and the more money I made. \n\nAnd using this technique is what led to over $550,000 in gross commissions last year without any prospecting, and without driving myself crazy. \n\nFirst, focus on the area where you get the highest ROI. Either where you get the most done, make the biggest impact, or make the most income. There will almost always be an 80\/20 rule at plays\u2026from there, really narrow it down and identify what that it and WHY that is. \n\nSecond, identify where you\u2019re spending 80% of your time chasing that last 20%. Find out where you\u2019re spending most of your time\u2026and make the decision to cut it, automate it, or outsource it. \n\nThird, do more of what WORKS with your 20% output that generates most of your results. If you find that you get 80% of your business through cold calling, for instance\u2026do more cold calling. If you\u2019re in e-commerce and find that 80% of your income comes from iPhone cases\u2026do more iPhone cases. Focus on replicating the 20% of your cause that leads to 80% of the effect. This is about optimizing as much as possible and working efficiently, not harder. \n\nIt\u2019s about remembering that the minority of your efforts produce the majority of your results. Then identifying this and leveraging it to do MORE of what works, and less of what doesn\u2019t have the best ROI. This frees you up with MORE time and by focusing on your 20% that generates 80%, you should be able to INCREASE your revenue or productivity rather quickly - while optimizing at the same time.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-23T22:30:01Z","tags":["80\/20","80\/20 rule","80\/20 principle","how to make money in real estate","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing 101","real estate investing strategy","real estate investing 2018","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to be a real estate agent","how I became a millionaire","how to become a millionaire","how to invest in stocks","stock market 101","stock market 2018","gary vee","tai lopez","investing 2018","passive income","passive income 2018"],"title":"The 80\/20 Principle: How I went from $140k\/yr to $500k\/yr by working LESS","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zk1ZBLKjXs0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zk1ZBLKjXs0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zk1ZBLKjXs0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zk1ZBLKjXs0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zk1ZBLKjXs0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M38S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"883","dislikeCount":"152","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11573","viewCount":"201922"}},{"id":"mmjbFXwU9gA","snippet":{"description":"\u201cIf everyone knows how to do this, won\u2019t it make it less effective?\u201d - Common question I get asked.

Very few people actually go out and do something. Even though my videos might routinely get 10,000-20,000 views, only a very, very small percentage will actually do anything with that information. This means that of the people who might be \u201ccompetition,\u201d it\u2019s only an extremely small percentage that will actually move forward. This is the sad reality. \n2. Life is never a zero sum game. One persons gain does NOT mean your loss. There is such a thing as both parties benefiting equally, and there being more than enough to go around for everyone. It will be impossible to win everyone. It will be impossible to make ALL the money. So why try. You will work with the people who want to work with you for YOU. You will do well in your own niche that you enjoy the most. \n\nOf course there is healthy competition, too - if you can look to another person\/company\/business with inspiration as a reason to do better and improve, that\u2019s great. But there\u2019s a distinction between this and unhealthy competition where you\u2019re too focused on the other person and less about yourself. \n\nThe more you focus on someone else, the less you can improve yourself and actually do something productive to get to where you want to be.

Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nDisclosure: I started this channel purely for fun and it remains a hobby for me - I don\u2019t do this for the money, although this income just happens to be a byproduct of all the time I spend on here. This is not my full time job, I do this for fun, and I actually end up getting a MUCH higher ROI hour-for-hour working as a real estate agent selling homes than spending time on YouTube\u2026but I really really enjoy it, and if it happens to make money at the same time, cool :)\n\nSo the main part when it comes to this income is the most obvious, and that\u2019s YouTube ad revenue. This means that, on average, for every view I get on a video, I make about a penny. The amount that you see here might seem like a lot, but it absolutely didn\u2019t happen overnight and there\u2019s a year\u2019s worth of work, and probably over 1600 hours of effort that went into what you see today. Ad revenue like this isn\u2019t passive, and the swings in revenue could be fairly dramatic\u2026in December I made just over $7000, but in February I had a much slower month at $3200, that\u2019s over a 50% drop in revenue. So if someone is relying on YouTube ad revenue full time for income, it\u2019ll be a tough one to handle because at the end of the day, you\u2019re at the mercy of YouTube and how much they suggest your videos. \n\nNow the second component of this total income is amazon affiliate revenue. Now this is pretty small, but it ads up over time\u2026This works out to another $60 a month or so. It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019ll add up over time. For other creators out there, you can probably optimize this by linking to more expensive items - many people do this with camera equipment, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll make more revenue - but again, you shouldn\u2019t rely on this by any means. \n\nThe third revenue source from YouTube comes from my program, The Real Estate Agent Academy. Now this is something I spent MONTHS putting together, filming, and editing that teaches people how to generate business as a real estate agent. Now this type of real estate agent audience only makes up a very small portion of my YouTube demographic, although it does seem to generate about $6300 per month with very little advertising on my end. \n\nFinally, my last source of income is one-on-one coaching calls. I don\u2019t do this too often and it\u2019s really on a case-by-case basis depending on the person, but I mainly do coaching for active real estate agents and real estate investors. This works out to about $400\/month, give or take depending on how many people I talk to.\n\nAll in all, between ad revenue, program sales, amazon affiliate commissions, and coaching calls, it works out to about $13,800 per month\u2026and I\u2019d say I spend about 130 hours a month between them all. I would be doing all of this regardless if I was making $0 per month or $50,000 per month. So I definitely don\u2019t want anyone to get the idea that the only reason I\u2019m doing this is for money, but I have a feeling this video might inspire other people and give them the push knowing that it\u2019s possible to make a living off of YouTube as long as you\u2019re dedicated and add as much value to the other person as possible. \n\nNow for anyone thinking of doing something similar or wanting to make a living on Youtube, just be aware that you absolutely CAN - but success won\u2019t happen overnight. You will need to work upfront for a loss, with the expectation that if you provide value or entertainment, eventually it will come back to you and you can begin making a living. But consistency is key, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s easy to get discouraged if you do this full time and just can\u2019t make ends meet in the beginning\u2026so ideally I\u2019d keep Youtube part time as a hobby until you begin making money, and at that time you can evaluate whether or not it\u2019s something you\u2019d like to do.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-18T22:30:02Z","tags":["how to make money on youtube","how to make money online","how to make money on youtube 2018","how much youtubers make","how much youtube pays per view","how much youtubers earn","passive income","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income online","passive income 2018","how much I make on youtube","best investments 2018","real estate investing 101","real estate","real estate 101","graham stephan","ryan scribner"],"title":"How I make $13,800 PER MONTH on YouTube (How much YouTubers make)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/X7I6d6NAUMg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/X7I6d6NAUMg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/X7I6d6NAUMg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/X7I6d6NAUMg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/X7I6d6NAUMg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M52S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"736","dislikeCount":"59","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2530","viewCount":"50942"}},{"id":"1OHVzmzXA3A","snippet":{"description":"I came across a Grant Cardone video where he explains the 401k is a scam\u2026but is it? Lets do the FACTUAL analysis and find out ;) Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nOriginal Video:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hE0SvSJ1bkk&t=195s\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nMeetKevin\u2019s Channel:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/KevinPaffrath\n\nFor those that don\u2019t know, a 401k is basically just a type of retirement account where the money you invest is deducted from your total taxable income, and therefore you end up showing less income and paying less taxes\u2026by doing this, you end up having more money left over so you have a larger amount to invest with. Then when you hit the age of 59.5, you can begin withdrawing that money - but you pay taxes at THAT time, instead of paying taxes upfront. So this gives you a larger amount upfront to work for you and make more money long term. \n\nBut Grant Cardone says it\u2019s a scam setup by politicians to steal your money\u2026.hmmm\u2026.\n\nHere\u2019s the moral of the story here, from my perspective. And as always, I do my best to be as neutral as possible and just stick with the facts and the way I interpret these strategies. A 401k is a fantastic part of a well diversified retirement portfolio by investing with pre-tax money that\u2019s allowed to grow at a quicker rate with more money in invest. It should not be the ONLY thing you invest in, and you shouldn\u2019t rely on this entirely for a retirement. But it\u2019s absolutely not a \u201cScam\u201d by any way I see it. \n\nThe ONLY thing to out watch for is that many employers offer extremely overcomplicated, overly expensive 401k plans that aren\u2019t worth it - namely because of management fees. If you\u2019re paying a 1% annual management fee, with an actively managed fund that underperforms the stock market, adjusted for inflation, you could basically be sitting there earning only a few percent per year and tying up for your money until retirement. That\u2019s terrible. Many employers have also been under fire for secretly PROFITING from your 401k plans, but using these companies to get free services elsewhere, but making up for that cost with high-managed 401k fees. This isn\u2019t the norm, but it does happen\u2026for employers, they don\u2019t care what fund they use because it doesn\u2019t effect their bottom line\u2026but it effects YOURS. So it\u2019s important to do your research and understand what the 401k management fees are and decide from there if it\u2019s worth it. I pay 0.04% annually with Vanguard\u2026although the average is 0.97%, which is over 2400% HIGHER than I pay\u2026and that\u2019s absurd. \n\nSo my biggest recommendation is to check what your employer offers, decide if the fee is worth it to you - but you may as well contribute up to their employer match, where they give you $1 for $1 what you put in, since this is absolutely free money. \n\nAnd yes, it is true that I invest the MAJORITY of my money in real estate\u2026but I utilize everything I can so I have as many options to chose from. I have a Roth IRA, which is money that grows tax free until 59.5\u2026I have a SEP 401k, which is pre-tax money that is reduced from my earned income so I pay less in taxes, and I have real estate which is my focus. They each have their benefits, they each have their drawbacks, but nothing is a \u201cScam.\u201d Except Bitconnect. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-16T22:30:00Z","tags":["grant cardone","grant cardone scam","grant cardone 401k","401k","401k explained","401k for dummies","401k vs roth ira","401k investing","grant cardone real estate","grant cardone sales","grant cardone exposed","investing 101","real estate investing 101","real estate agent","real estate investing for beginners","passive income","passive income 101","how to make money in real estate","retirement planning","meetkevin","roth ira"],"title":"Grant Cardone: The 401K IS A SCAM?!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1OHVzmzXA3A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1OHVzmzXA3A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1OHVzmzXA3A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1OHVzmzXA3A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1OHVzmzXA3A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT22M4S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2260","dislikeCount":"761","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13265","viewCount":"412813"}},{"id":"rsPAAGL5G60","snippet":{"description":"This is my step-by-step answer for everyone who asks: How to become a real estate agent and what's the best way to start?

Actually get your real estate license. Go online and there are a TON of schools out there you can go to. Overall, it doesn\u2019t matter too much what class you take online - they\u2019re all pretty much the same, so I\u2019d go with the most cost effective option because you may as well just save the money. If you want to take the classes in person, you can but it\u2019ll generally take a little longer and it\u2019ll cost you a little more money, so personally I\u2019d rather just get it out of the way as quick as possible, for as little as possible, and just take it online. \n\n2. As you\u2019re getting your license, or after you get your license, begin networking. Just go to open houses in the area you want to work in and meet other agents. This part is just about meeting other agents and getting to know the markets you want to work in - you\u2019ll need to do this at some point, anyway, so you may as well just start now. \n\n3. When you\u2019re at the house, introduce yourself to the agent and begin networking. As long as they\u2019re not busy or right in the middle of something, most would be happy to talk with you. Just be honest, say you\u2019re getting in real estate and want to learn the business. Ask how they enjoy it, what they think of it, how long they\u2019ve been doing it for, what they think of that area - just be open to learning from them and hearing their opinions.\n\n4. So by this point, I\u2019m going to assume you\u2019ve been doing the third step for a 2-3 months now, you\u2019ve probably seen 50-70 homes, you\u2019ve probably met at least three or four dozen Realtors by now. And this is the part where everyone asks me\u2026\u201dhow do I get started, what\u2019s the best way?\u201d  Once you get your license, the BEST way to begin in real estate is to work as an assistant or intern to another agent to learn the business. \n\nChances are you\u2019re not going to do much business in your first 6-12 months anyway, so use this time as an opportunity to learn as much as possible. This does a few things: You\u2019re able to learn firsthand from an agent who\u2019s busy enough to need an assistant. And you\u2019re able to get PAID to learn, which means you\u2019d be figuring this stuff out on your own, anyway, so you may as well get paid to learn from someone who\u2019s doing it day to day. So how do you find someone like this? Well, you\u2019ve networked with dozens of real estate agents while you were getting your license - reach out to them! Offer to help. If there are particular people you really liked, call them up and offer to take them out for lunch or coffee. This is how I ended up meeting my first mentor, it was from a random open house I went to and we hit it off. \n\nYou could also walk into the real estate brokerages you\u2019d like to work for, in the area you want to work in, and speak with the person at the front desk to find out if anyone is in need of an assistant. You can also check online for job postings, I promise there are usually a few going at any single time from agents looking for assistants.\n\n5. I\u2019d recommend doing #4 for 6-12 months. Literally this is the best chance to learn and get PAID to learn, or get entirely free training from someone day to day firsthand. But this isn\u2019t the end goal - obviously the end goal is to get comfortable enough to eventually go off your own, and I\u2019d imagine after a year you should be fairly comfortable with the process to feel comfortable enough to forge your own path and begin growing your own business. This is where you ideally want to be\u2026and after a year, you should be in the position where you know exactly what to do and how you can begin growing your business without the training wheels of someone else.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-13T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to become a real estate agent","how to become a real estate agent in california","real estate agent","real estate agent 101","real estate agent training","real estate agent career","real estate agent tips","real estate agent beginner","real estate agent day in the life","real estate agent salary","mike ferry","coach tom ferry","bryan casella","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to sell real estate","real estate agent 2018"],"title":"The BEST way to start Selling Real Estate as a Real Estate Agent 101","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rsPAAGL5G60\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rsPAAGL5G60\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rsPAAGL5G60\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rsPAAGL5G60\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rsPAAGL5G60\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"313","dislikeCount":"59","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3965","viewCount":"86258"}},{"id":"giUZ1Th4UNU","snippet":{"description":"Is Real Estate a Bubble in 2018? These are the most common economic red flags and how they impact real estate prices - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nLearn my exact strategies to help grow your career as a real estate agent to a six-figure income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and exactly what you can do to begin taking your career to the next level\u2026these strategies took me to $120,000,000 in sales volume: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nConcerns:\nThe stock market is artificially inflated by low interest rates and it will decline, bringing down real estate. The FED lowered interest rates to record lows to stimulate the economy post 2009. This creates cheap money for businesses to borrow and people to borrow from - and I don\u2019t disagree with this, low interest rates DO artificially inflate prices beyond what would be capable under a higher interest rate. But, my only defense is that we can\u2019t expect interest rates to rise to insane levels overnight to put the economy in a tailspin.\n\nGrowing government debt - experts predict we will be reaching 24 trillion dollars of debt by the end of 2018. BUT, about 2\/3rd of the debt is owned by US citizens and corporations, half of the national debt is owned by the US, and a large part of that is in social security. Debt isn\u2019t always bad, and in some years inflation is actually higher than the interest rate the US pays - so they\u2019ll actually make money. But overall what matters most is debt in relation to the gross domestic product of the US, and right now we stand just above 100% which is perfectly healthy. Ultimately, taking on more debt is risky - but this has more to do with rising interest rates and how THAT will effect housing prices, than the level of debt itself, as the US would have to raise interest rates to help offset their debt. \n\nThe third thing people say is \u201cstudent loan bubble.\u201d Student loans have gone from half a billion to $1.4 TRILLION between 2007 and now. I do see us having disastrous problems for individuals graduating with debt..but this won\u2019t have a direct correlation on housing prices, from my perspective. With a low supply of homes, there are still not enough properties to meet current demand. Student loans are not \u201churting\u201d the market - they\u2019re just not adding to sales numbers as buyers, which is already at a record high, even accounting for current student loan debt. But I agree, student loan debt is awful - but I can\u2019t see this leading to a decline in real estate prices.\n\nFinally, wages\u2026wages haven\u2019t gone up as high as housing prices have, therefore it\u2019s a bubble! This has truth to it, but it\u2019s not the entire picture. It\u2019s true that wage growth hasn\u2019t grown much, although wages HAVE gone up dramatically for highly skilled workers in large cities, and these are the areas that are seeing the largest booms in housing prices. This is big law, tech, engineering, and executives. And because of this concentration of growth, foreign money continues to pour in, further increasing demand. So yes, for low-skilled workers - it\u2019ll be a tough one to go up against, and housing prices are exceeding low-end wage growth. \n\nPositives:\nWe\u2019re still about 14-20% away from pre-recession prices when adjusted for inflation. This leads me to think that we still have some upward growth.\n\nInterest rates are still at historic lows. We all know interest rates are going to be going up\u2026so locking in now has some insane long term advantages. This creates an urgency to buy like we haven\u2019t really seen before, which should continue to bolster real estate prices. \n\nLimited supply. People aren\u2019t selling. The reason: they don\u2019t want to become buyers. There\u2019s just not enough to go around - builders can\u2019t keep up with demand, building restrictions hinder larger cities from building more housing, and this creates a limited supply of homes to chose from. While many areas are just starting to develop more housing, it\u2019s just not enough, and even though it\u2019s picking up, it\u2019s still a long way from there being an oversupply. This in itself has the power to continue keeping housing prices bolstered for real estate, and real estate investing. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-11T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate bubble","real estate bubble 2018","real estate bubble 2008","real estate bubble burst","real estate investing","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 2018","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","real estate investing strategies","real estate agent","real estate agent 101","real estate agent training","how I became a millionaire","how to become a millionaire","grant cardone","valuetainment","biggerpockets"],"title":"Are we in a REAL ESTATE BUBBLE?!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/giUZ1Th4UNU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/giUZ1Th4UNU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/giUZ1Th4UNU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/giUZ1Th4UNU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/giUZ1Th4UNU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"426","dislikeCount":"51","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1644","viewCount":"24227"}},{"id":"iugTkMld3WY","snippet":{"description":"It\u2019s no surprise that this is my favorite way to invest in real estate, and also one of the fastest ways you can grow your wealth\u2026.and this is called the BRRRR strategy of real estate investing. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLearn my exact strategies to help grow your career as a real estate agent to a six-figure income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and exactly what you can do to begin taking your career to the next level\u2026these strategies took me to $120,000,000 in sales volume: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe BRRRR Method: This basically uses the equity and profit from one property to fund the next property through strategic leverage. And then the next property can fund the next one\u2026and so on, until after a few years you\u2019ve amassed an army of homes that just throw cash at your every month. \n\n1. The first step is to buy a property, obviously. But the difference here is that you can\u2019t just buy anything - the property not only needs to cash flow, but there needs to be some opportunity for equity. Your equity is basically just the amount of \u201cworth\u201d tied up in the property, minus your loan balance. So you either need to buy into equity by buying something BELOW what its market value is, or buying something where you can add equity with strategic renovations. Most deals won\u2019t work - you need to be better than the average here and really become an expert in your area to spot the best deals, and the patience to wait around until that happens.\n\n2. Renovate. Once you buy something, you\u2019ll fix it up. Generally this is the best and easiest way to add value to a property. Most places that need work price themselves accordingly. Doing the work yourself saves you from paying someone else\u2019s profit in managing a renovation, and often times you can renovate a property much cheaper than someone else will charge for doing the same thing.\n\n3. The third step is rent\u2026in that you now rent out the property. You should have had an idea of what price you\u2019d get from the beginning when you bought the property, so it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise what you can rent the property for. The property should rent high enough to pay off all of your expenses AND cash flow on top of it. Like I said, not every property will do this - you will need to find the 1\/30 where it makes sense to buy, at the right price, that\u2019ll rent for high enough, with enough equity to add to the deal. \n\n4. NOW WE REFINANCE! This is where the bank pays off your previous loan, and gives you a NEW loan based off the new, higher value of the property. This means that you\u2019ll have some \u201cCash at closing,\u201d as it\u2019s called. Now you pretty much got some money back, you have a cash flowing house, and you can do this entire process over again.\n\n5. And then\u2026you repeat the process and start over again with the next one! The advantage here is that every time you buy something under market value, you increase your net worth. By fixing it up, you increase your net worth and cash flow at the same time. The higher your net worth and the more equity in a property, the more banks are willing to lend you to do it again and continue to increase your cashflow. This is by far my favorite strategy, and you\u2019ll finish this up with a trail of cash flowing properties behind you. Yes, it takes some work to identify and fix up a property - but it\u2019s worth it. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-09T22:30:00Z","tags":["fastest way to make money","fastest way to build wealth","brrrr method","brrrr method real estate investing","real estate investing","best way to invest in real estate","how ot invest in real estate","how to buy real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing strategies 2018","real estate strategies","how to buy real estate with no money","how to buy real estate cheap","how to invest in real estate for beginners","how to invest in real estate with little money","grant cardone"],"title":"The Fastest Way to Build Wealth Investing in Real Estate: The BRRRR Strategy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iugTkMld3WY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iugTkMld3WY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iugTkMld3WY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iugTkMld3WY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/iugTkMld3WY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"687","dislikeCount":"92","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10423","viewCount":"191959"}},{"id":"Xd3XMrkrv2A","snippet":{"description":"After the totally unexpected popularity of my April fools video, I thought I\u2019d actually use this as an opportunity to discuss cryptocurrency prices and a little why I believe we\u2019re seeing a decline in prices, what the future could bring, and what we can learn from this going forward. Enjoy! Snap\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nWith cryptocurrency, it becomes really, really difficult to give a valuation - much of its value lies within our own interpretation. Cryptocurrency was its own market that was difficult to value because it was ultimately a currency, so it had to test various levels and demand for sustainability. Just like ANY investment out there, even with real estate, I believe we naturally have the tendency to overestimate how high something will go, and how long it\u2019ll fundamentally take to get there. \n\nIn reality, if cryptocurrency is to ever be successful and mass adopted, it can\u2019t have that much volatility in price that quickly. So for everyone out there who really wants cryptocurrency to work, it cannot be largely speculated - and mass adoption won\u2019t really take place until we\u2019ve hit an equilibrium between utility and present worth.\n\nI actually found it interesting that railways, radio, and the internet all went through exuberant bubbles before becoming mainstream. Frankly, I think a bubble can actually be a good thing - it gets people openly researching, investing, and finding interest in something they\u2019d ordinarily otherwise look over. And sure, a lot of capital was also lost, but the capital that was spent ended up forming some great opportunities and technologies that we can use moving forward. And anytime you make an investment, it\u2019s important to distinguish the difference between buying on fundamentals vs speculation. From my perspective, the entire reason cryptocurrencies have gone down is ONLY because the hype and media attention has died down. And the media attention has gone down because prices have gone down. It\u2019s no longer exciting news to report on anymore, and those who have lost are often discouraged from re-investing. \n\nBut one point I\u2019d like to throw out there is that with this latest craze, many people unknowingly threw in money that they couldn\u2019t afford to lose, largely based on watching what other people are doing and wanting and believing in those same returns. The problem starts when someone jumps into something without fully understanding the implications of their actions, purely based off watching someone else, who may or may not be looking out for your best interest. This leads to the human psychology to naturally discredit information that doesn\u2019t align with their own beliefs or self benefit, otherwise known as a \u201cConfirmation Bias.\u201d It\u2019s our minds amazing ability to go to great lengths to rationalize only the information we want to believe, and tune out anything that opposes or challenges those view points. And it\u2019s very, very easy to want to believe in striking it rich in crypto. \n\nIt\u2019s also really easy to actively seek out the information and groups which align with our own thoughts, further perpetuating this effect. This type of tunnel vision isn\u2019t uncommon, and I\u2019d venture to say that no one is really above this. We\u2019re ALL guilty of this to some extent and it\u2019s important to be aware of it. I\u2019m certainly no exception to this, don\u2019t get me wrong. And as we go deeper down the rabbit hole, this is why it\u2019s so important, with anything, to be aware of our subconscious thoughts and try to be aware when we\u2019re closing ourself off to other viewpoints and perspectives. If there\u2019s ever a time you feel like something is easy, risk free, and the rewards are incredible..it\u2019s not. \n\nAnd finally, when it comes to investing in general, take a step back. If you find yourself getting too emotional about an investment, you may have found you don\u2019t have the tolerance you thought you did, you invested more than you were comfortable with, or you don\u2019t believe you did enough research into what you were buying to feel confident about it long term. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-06T22:30:00Z","tags":["cryptocurrency","bitcoin","cryptocurrency crash","bitcoin crash","bitcoin 2018","cryptocurrency 2018","bitcoin price prediction","cryptocurrency prediction","bitcoin investment strategy","cryptocurrency investment strategy","bitcoin explained","cryptocurrency news","cryptocurrency for beginners","bitcoin for beginners","cryptocurrency investing","bitcoin investing","bitcoin millionaire","how to invest in crypto","how to invest in bitcoin","altcoins 2018","altcoins to invest in","crypto podcast"],"title":"The END of Cryptocurrency?

I\u2019ll explain why and unveil the curtain behind the successful strategies Tai Lopez uses every time you watch\u2026enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nLets talk about the overall theme between his videos, and that\u2019s his simple production value. Low production actually has MASSIVE ADVANTAGES over highly produced content. When making content like this, the low production value makes it relatable. It catches us off guard. It makes it easier to feel like the person is actually talking to you directly. It also seems authentic in the sense that it\u2019s unplanned, it\u2019s spur of the moment, and it sounds like he\u2019s saying whatever comes to mind - just like you\u2019d talk with a long time friend. \n\nAnother overall theme from his videos is that they\u2019re visually captivating. Sometimes it\u2019s a house, it\u2019s a car, it\u2019s him washing a car\u2026there\u2019s always something going on and there\u2019s always movement. I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s a lot harder to capture someones attention long term if there isn\u2019t movement - we naturally get bored of stagnation because it becomes predictable and our mind starts to wander. But as soon as you begin moving around, your mind continues to see it as fresh and innovative. \n\nBut one thing Tai Lopez is really, really good at - is his initial hook. He has 5 seconds to grab your attention so you don\u2019t click \u201cskip now.\u201d He\u2019ll ask an initial question or make a statement that makes you WANT to listen just to hear what he\u2019s about to say. This means that now you\u2019re INVESTED in hearing him out\u2026and once you begin to invest, it makes it harder to click out.\n\nFrom there, he\u2019ll go into a story - and nothing sparks our imagination and emotions better than a story. Any time you want to get information across efficiently, a story is the best way to do that. A story will make a point, it will make it memorable, it builds connections, it draws you in, and it creates EMOTION. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed a common recurring theme halfway through is stories is that he\u2019ll go off subject really quick and throw in a quick humble brag. And it works well\u2026you\u2019re right in the middle of a story, and then out of nowhere he deviates to talk about his mansion, his car, his Lamborghini\u2026this is a really, really subtle demonstration of authority that this guy knows what he\u2019s talking about and the the\u2019s successful. Because we\u2019re already in the middle of a story by this time, we\u2019re going to pay closer attention to these mentions because we\u2019re already immersed in what he has to say. \n\nH then does his best to show that he\u2019s no different from the person who\u2019s watching. He\u2019ll mention he grew up in a trailer park, that he never came from money, that he\u2019s never been used to anything like this\u2026it makes us feel more relaxed and at ease all of a sudden it doesn\u2019t seem as \u201cunobtainable.\u201d \n\nAs Tai begins finishing up the ad, you\u2019ll realize he never actually tells you the ending of the story\u2026instead, he directs you to input your email and he\u2019ll email it out to you. \n\nBut there\u2019s one more close that\u2019s really important that really helps push it over the edge\u2026and Tai is an expert at this. This is urgency. He sets it up so that you realize that your LOSS is not doing it. By you NOT acting NOW, you\u2019re going to be the type of person who won\u2019t be succeeding. \n\nAnd because you\u2019ve already invested a few minutes of your time, in the middle of a story, and you\u2019re curious how it ends and what he\u2019s talking about\u2026you\u2019re pretty likely just to sign up to see what happens. And it\u2019s a low risk investment on your part, just put in your email address and the story continues. \n\nAnd this is what Tai Lopez is great at. He\u2019s found a way to get people interested in self help in a way that no one really used before - typically when you think business or self help programs, you think of a boring old man wearing a suit. But he was able to successfully rebrand the entire self-help genre in a way that gets kids interested in reading and making money through understanding their deeper desires. And THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is why Tai Lopez ads are so effective.\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-04T22:30:02Z","tags":["tai lopez","tai lopez ad","tai lopez talk","tai lopez scam","tai lopez knowledge","tai lopez exposed","tai lopez cryptocurrency","tai lopez house tour","affiliate marketing","amazon fba","dropshipping","shopify","real estate agent","real estate mentor","how to buy real estate","how to invest in real estate","real estate agent 101","investment real estate 101","grant cardone","gary vee","valuetainment","how I became a millionaire","how to save a million dollars","why are tai lopez ads effective"],"title":"The TRUTH behind why Tai Lopez ads are SO EFFECTIVE","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WUGsYsy16kE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WUGsYsy16kE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WUGsYsy16kE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WUGsYsy16kE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WUGsYsy16kE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M38S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2604","dislikeCount":"981","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"49655","viewCount":"512140"}},{"id":"5RC6IQYRP6w","snippet":{"description":"Never thought I\u2019d have to make a video like this\u2026feel free to support me on snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-04-01T21:32:56Z","tags":["cryptocurrency","bitcoin","cryptocurrency 2018","bitcoin 2018","cryptocurrency for beginners","bitcoin 101","cryptocurrency 101","how to buy bitcoin","how to buy cryptocurrency","bitcoin crash","cryptocurrency crash","bitcoin crash 2018","cryptocurrency crash 2018","bitcoin investment strategy","crypto investments","tai lopez","tai lopez crypto","grant cardone crypto","bitcoin explained","cryptocurrency explained"],"title":"i just lost everything in crypto","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5RC6IQYRP6w\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5RC6IQYRP6w\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5RC6IQYRP6w\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5RC6IQYRP6w\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5RC6IQYRP6w\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT6M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2703","dislikeCount":"3488","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4502","viewCount":"234544"}},{"id":"UcYmk0rFeWo","snippet":{"description":"Meet Mike Rosehart, the self made Real Estate Investor from Ontario, Canada who retired at the age of 25 years old through investing in real estate.

This instilled in him a frugal mindset, while also working part time jobs and saving his income throughout high school. His grades allowed him a scholarship into a prestigious Canadian University, where he used his savings and scholarship money to invest in a multi-family property where he lived in one of the units and rented out the others, known as house hacking. This allowed him to profit $200 every month from his investment, while also having a free place to stay through 2014.  \n\nMike continued saving, eventually landing a $50,000\/year job out of University doing management consulting. This led him to purchasing more real estate and slowly improving his cash flow through using the BRRRR Method of real estate investing: Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat. This snowballed to a 19-property portfolio worth about $5,000,000. \n\nHe recently decided to scale down from his portion, profiting over $1,000,000 in equity, while still keeping 7 properties. This has allowed him to retire at the age of 25 years old through real estate investing, while he continues to own real estate and invest passively in Ontario, Canada. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-29T22:30:00Z","tags":["retired at 25","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate 101","real estate investing 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 2018","brrrr method","brrrr method bigger pockets","retired at 30","retired at 40","how to invest","stock market 101","passive income","passive income ideas 2018","passive income online","mike rosehart","meetkevin","dave ramsey","investing 2018","financial independence"],"title":"Meet The Real Estate Investor who RETIRED at 25 Years Old (Self Made)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UcYmk0rFeWo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UcYmk0rFeWo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UcYmk0rFeWo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UcYmk0rFeWo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UcYmk0rFeWo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT24M22S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1115","dislikeCount":"54","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2316","viewCount":"53749"}},{"id":"u7oDWW7042E","snippet":{"description":"This is how I was able to earn a six-figure month as a Real Estate Agent, how I was able to achieve this, and what\u2019s involved in earning this type of income - regardless of the business you\u2019re in. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nThe bulk of this income was the result of me selling a $7,000,000 home here in Los Angeles, another $4000 or so in rent from rental properties, and $1246.71 in YouTube ad revenue. There\u2019s other stuff thrown in there as well, like maybe a lease commission or two, but it\u2019ll be too small to look through and mention so won\u2019t make a big difference. But lets discuss the biggest one, the $7,000,000 sale. \n\nKeep in mind, I\u2019m not someone with $7m connections - I didn\u2019t grow up around people who were spending $7,000,000 on a house. It just happened organically and grew over time as a result of long term consistency, follow up, and customer service with the people I met in my beginning years of real estate - and this $7m client was referred to me. It was a referral from a client I had met back in 2013 who called me off one of my leases on Craigslist. \n\nFor anyone in a sales or customer oriented business, your BEST business and your HAPPIEST customer base will always be the ones that have used you in the past - once you get an \u201cin\u201d with someone and they were satisfied, they\u2019ll use you again. Every satisfied client will inevitably, at some time or another, refer you someone else who happens to be just as awesome. And that becomes another person to add to the database. \n\nReferrals are the type of client that could make or break the previous relationship you have. You really go out on the line when you refer someone to somebody - not only is it a huge compliment, but it\u2019s also a lot of pressure because if you mess this up, you\u2019re likely to lose BOTH clients and ruin all the work you\u2019ve put in so far. So it\u2019s vital to treat the referral like royalty, no matter how big or small they may be. And that\u2019s what I did. \n\nGetting this type of business is really the cumulation of a lot of time spent in real estate, a lot of repeat business, and a lot of following up. When it comes to business, I really think it\u2019s so important to have a long term outlook on everything - and I really believed that when I started, I\u2019d be doing this for decades, and it\u2019s all about building up a solid foundation of happy clients - and this meant keeping them happy long term, time and time again. And sure enough, we ended up finding this referral a home at $7m, and this led to one of my best single months EVER in real estate as far as commissions go, and also my highest sale EVER in real estate at $7,000,000.\n\nSo what it really comes down to is just patience. Behind this was 9 years of doing real estate\u2026it was me meeting thousands of people, following up consistently, going out of my way for each person, and treating ever referral like Royalty to get to this place. It\u2019s never about trying to close a quick deal, move on, closing a quick deal, move on. Had I done that, I\u2019d never have repeat business - and right now, that\u2019s the business that keeps me going. So no matter what business you\u2019re in, look at it as though this will be a long term relationship. Every happy customer will come back to you. They will refer you more business. Then THAT business will come back to you, then THEY will refer you business, and so on. \n\nSo for your business or for whatever you do, see it long term. Never go chasing after short term money if it means they\u2019re never going to use you again.  And this is exactly how I was able to make $136,000 in a single month of working as a real estate agent. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-25T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate 101","real estate","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate 2018","real estate investing 101","real estate agent 101","real estate agent day in the life","How i became a millionaire","how to make passive income","passive income 2018","real estate agent career","tom ferry","mike ferry","grant cardone","how to get your real estate license","real estate investing strategies","investing 101"],"title":"How I made $136,474.43 in 30 days as a Real Estate Agent","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u7oDWW7042E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u7oDWW7042E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u7oDWW7042E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u7oDWW7042E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u7oDWW7042E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"251","dislikeCount":"22","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"854","viewCount":"21484"}},{"id":"HVKhaRwzI8E","snippet":{"description":"Probably one of the biggest \u201cCritiques\u201d of my videos is that I\u2019ll often assume and base my calculations off of getting an 8% return, which many find unrealistic -  so here\u2019s what I base my calculations from.

While we can base our returns off long term historical trends and use that as an educated guide, there will never be a bulletproof 8% return without any risk whatsoever. The other important distinction is that when we assume an 8% return, we never will see a consistent 8% return. I take the historic AVERAGE, meaning over a period of 30+ years. Short term, it\u2019ll be much more difficult to calculate. Not financial advice, for entertainment purposes only - do your own research ;)\n\nThe first is the SP500. If we look at the historic averages of the SP500, it\u2019s returned close to 8% adjusted for inflation with the dividends re-invested. Again, nothing is guaranteed - and it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll see lower or higher returns in the future, but I believe it\u2019s reasonable to assume about an 8% return given the last 100+ years of data. \n\nThe second way you can get 8% returns, much like the above example, is individual stocks. This one is potentially MUCH risker, but with MUCH higher reward. I\u2019d assume it to be much less passive than buying an index because you\u2019re specifically researching a company and then monitoring that company to make sure they\u2019re doing as well as you expected, and then maybe adjusting your position as necessary. It\u2019s also much riskier because you have fewer eggs in your basket - unlike the SP500 where you basically have a small piece of 500 companies, when investing in individual stocks, you might only have a few - this has the potential to dramatically increase or decrease your returns. \n\nThe third way, and everyone will know as my favorite way to get an 8% return is through real estate investing. I have a trillion videos on the subject of how to make money in real estate, but your real estate returns are typically broken up into three categories: Cash return, Equity by paying down your loan, and Appreciation. Generally, getting a 8-10% return in real estate is fairly common - in fact, some people end up getting insanely higher returns depending on the area. Not only are you receiving rent, but you\u2019re also paying down the loan - building equity, and owning an appreciating asset. Win win win! \n\nThe fourth way you can make returns of 8% or higher is through peer-to-peer lending websites like LendingClub or Prosper. This isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve personally done, but I know many people who have had a very good experience doing this and have averaged about 7-10%. These websites allow you to \u201cloan\u201d people money at set interest rates, for as low as $25 each. So far this has been fairly successful and seems to work great for people who loan money to those consolidating debt with a high income and decent credit score, but we\u2019ve yet to see how sites like this will do during the next recession. I\u2019m sure the returns will lower in economic turmoil, but regardless, it still seems like a fairly decent option for those willing to try it. \n\nBut the key to doing this is to always have a long term outlook. From the way I see it, the short term is too difficult to predict - but long term, we\u2019ve got a great baseline from many decades of research behind us. And also, the longer you can hold, the lower the risk - no one knows what will be in the future, but we can certainly use the past as a guide - and this, is exactly how I figure my 8% returns. Not financial advice (Again) ;) \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-23T22:30:02Z","tags":["where to get an 8% return","where to get a 10% return","how to invest","how to invest in 2018","investment strategies 2018","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investment","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","passive income","passive income ideas","p2p lending","propser","lending club","stock market 101","compound interest 101","stock market for beginners","financial education","ryan scribner","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"How to Invest for an 8% Return","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HVKhaRwzI8E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HVKhaRwzI8E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HVKhaRwzI8E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HVKhaRwzI8E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HVKhaRwzI8E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M3S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"544","dislikeCount":"84","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4488","viewCount":"107228"}},{"id":"EBQdNSCOYBc","snippet":{"description":"This small, but subtle change in perspective is easily missed, but probably had one of the biggest impacts on me.

It\u2019s probably the reason why many people who watch my videos unfortunately don\u2019t do anything with the information, there\u2019s only a very small percentage of you who will actually follow through.\n\nIt\u2019s understanding the relationship between being at the CAUSE of something, or being at the EFFECT of what\u2019s going on around you. Think of it this way - in everything we do, there are two types of people: one type which CAUSES things to happen, and another that REACTS to what\u2019s going on around them. Imagine it like you\u2019re neck deep in the ocean and you have waves constantly hitting you, pushing you in a certain direction - and you\u2019re exerting energy in REACTION to those waves, versus being the wave that\u2019s having an effect on everything in its path. \n\nSo just think - right now, are you taking control of your life in accomplishing what you want? Are you the cause of what\u2019s going on in your life and are you the one making things happen? Or are you the one who\u2019s focusing on what other people are doing, reacting to those around you, and getting swayed by the effect of the waves? \n\nThis very subtle shift in perspective was really a light-bulb moment for me.  Here I was, two years ago, WISHING I could make YouTube videos myself but instead, I came up with a million excuses of why I couldn\u2019t do it and I\u2019d just watch other people on YouTube actually doing what I wanted to do. \u2026but once I understood that you have the choice to either be at the CAUSE of something, or be EFFECTED by the things going around you, I decided - \u201cscrew it\u201d I\u2019m going to be at the cause, and I\u2019m going to be the one making YouTube videos rather than the one watching them. \n\nThink of it in your own life - are you the one actually taking the initiative, are you behind the curtains making things happen - or are you just casually watching everything else going on around you, and you\u2019re at the whim of chance? Just by this small change, and understanding that you have the choice to be at the cause, you can begin to create whatever reality you want.  \n\nIt\u2019s easy when you start here - how can YOU be like the person you want to be? How would that person act? How can you be the type of person to give value in some way or another? What can you start doing now that will lead you in that direction, instead of you being influenced by everything going on around you? Once you tune out the distractions, you realize that you\u2019re the one who really has total control over where you focus your time and how you take the initiative to put everything you\u2019ve learned into becoming the CAUSE and making things happen. You really end up getting what you focus on. \n\nUnderstanding this difference has the potential to really lead you life in a more purposeful direction, where you can create your own reality and decide what you do, rather than be the one reacting to everything else going on around you. It\u2019s really about taking the initiative to get what you want and make it happen, rather than relying on chance occurrences to bring you what you want. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-21T22:30:00Z","tags":["million dollar listing","million dollar listing los angeles","los angeles million dollar listing","madison hildebrand","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate investor","real estate investing strategies","real estate 2018","real estate investing","real estate investing 2018","how to make passive income","how to make passive income 2018","how to invest 2018","cause vs effect","motivational real estate","how i became a millionaire","how i got on million dollar listing","gary vee"],"title":"How I got on Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles...Twice","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBQdNSCOYBc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBQdNSCOYBc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBQdNSCOYBc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBQdNSCOYBc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBQdNSCOYBc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M56S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"279","dislikeCount":"17","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"766","viewCount":"13783"}},{"id":"AJSCT51Rfws","snippet":{"description":"In many situations, paying off your mortgage early could potentially be costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars\u2026and I\u2019ll run the numbers to show this based off real world examples.

But this isn\u2019t always the case. The reason people think this way is because they haven\u2019t really looked at the true cost of ownership, what their money is really worth, and they only focus on the end number. On our $400,000 loan example, your payment is $1956 per month and you wind up paying $304,000 in interest over 30 years. But there are three very important considerations here:\n\n1. The first is the mortgage interest tax write off - this is what makes real estate extremely appealing, and why keeping a mortgage helps long term.For the average person in a 23% tax bracket, with a 4.2% interest rate, after you factor in your write offs, your ACTUAL cost of interest is only 3.23%. \n2. The second factor is Inflation. Because the bank is holding the entire loan over 30 years and you get to pay bits and pieces of it over time, it should be safe to assume a 2% AVERAGE inflation rate over 30 years. This means that even though you\u2019re paying a NET interest rate now of 3.23%, if we subtract 2% annually for inflation, this means that you\u2019re really only effectively paying 1.23% in interest after tax write offs and inflation. \n3. Finally, the third factor is opportunity cost. Can you make MORE than a 1.23% return ANYWHERE ELSE adjusted for inflation? The answer is pretty much always yes. This means that if you INVEST your money instead of paying down the mortgage, mathematically over the term of the loan you\u2019d come out ahead than if you just paid off the loan early. \n\nSo with these points above, we\u2019ll take two scenarios. In scenario one, you have a 30-year, $400,000 loan at a 4.2% interest rate that you pay off in half the time - you increase your payments from $1956 to $3000 per month in order to make this happen. Then once the loan is paid off, you invest the full amount in the stock market for another 15 years. After an additional 15 years, that works out to be just over $1,000,000. So you now have a paid of house plus a million dollars.\n\nBut what happens if you kept the 30-year mortgage and instead of you paying it off in half the time by increasing your payments to $3000\/mo, you just invested the extra $1050 per month instead? Because you didn\u2019t pay down your mortgage early and you invested that extra money instead, at a 7.5% return in an SP500 index fund\u2026at the end of 30 years, you\u2019ll have a paid off home PLUS $1,433,000..\n\nThis means that over 30 years, that\u2019s a difference of $433,000\u2026by NOT paying down your mortgage early, and instead investing the difference. \n\nAlthough keep in mind,  if you have a really high interest rate on your loan, above about 6%, it\u2019s probably better to pay it off. This is because the upside to investing gets smaller and smaller the higher your mortgage interest rate is. \n\nBut the biggest advantage of paying it off early is that with the above example, we assume the person will actually invest the money rather than pay off their loan early. In order for this calculation to work, the person needs to be disciplined enough to actually invest the different and not spend it.  \n\nBut for anyone with the discipline to actually stick with an investing plan instead of paying down the mortgage, statistically and mathematically, you can often make more money paying it off slowly than paying it off early. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-18T22:00:01Z","tags":["pay down mortgage early","how to pay down mortgage quickly","better to pay down mortgage","how to pay down mortgage in 5 years","should I pay my mortgage early","should i pay off my mortgage","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate 2018","real estate investing 2018","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate coach","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate agent 101"],"title":"PSA: Why it\u2019s a BAD IDEA to pay down your mortgage early!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AJSCT51Rfws\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AJSCT51Rfws\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AJSCT51Rfws\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AJSCT51Rfws\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AJSCT51Rfws\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2495","dislikeCount":"1340","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"9414","viewCount":"312050"}},{"id":"d0lbVxWteNE","snippet":{"description":"This is a great example of what can come when someone invests often and lives frugally, while only earning a modest salary working a 9-5 and how that can snowball into something massive, to the tune of over $9 million dollars over the course of a lifetime.

She worked as a secretary for a Law Firm. She made a modest salary. She took the bus and subway to get around. She never flexed on them haters. She also accumulated a fortune of about $9,000,000. She grew up in Brooklyn New York during the Great Depression. In 1947 she began working at a Law Firm as one of its first employees, where she ended up working for 67 years until she retired at 96 years old. But how she lived day-to-day is an indication of how she became so wealthy. \n\nThey lived in a Rent controlled apartment. She took the Subway to work. She\u2019d opt to take the bus over spending the money for a cab. She never talked money, never called attention to herself, and she lived extremely modestly. This allowed her to secretly invest her money, instead. She\u2019d save her money, live modestly, and invest everything she could. In her lifetime, thanks to compound interest, this lead to over a $9,000,000 Fortune\u2026$8.2 million of which was donated to charity for college scholarships. \n\nThis story isn\u2019t unique, either - there are plenty like it that almost carry the exact same storyline. \n\nLeonard Gigowski is another example:\nhttps:\/\/www.jsonline.com\/story\/news\/columnists\/jim-stingl\/2017\/11\/21\/stingl-frugal-alum-gives-thomas-more-students-13-million-reasons-say-thanks\/882913001\/\nThe left $13,000,000 to charity upon his death. He worked as a Navy Cook during World War 2 and shortly after worked as a meat cutter. That company gave him company stock, which he held on to - and later opened up his own grocery store. He expanded to a night club and rental properties over his lifetime, but maintained a frugal lifestyle. When he passed away at the age of 90, his thrifty living and investing habits left him with $13,000,000 which he donated to charity.\n\nOr Grace Groner, another secretary who amassed a $7,000,000 fortune for charity by the time she passed away:\nhttp:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/an-old-ladys-three-60-shares-from-1935-are-now-worth-7-million-2010-3\nLike our other two examples, she didn\u2019t have a high income - but she lived modestly and invested her money. In 1931 she began working for Abbot Laboratories, and in 1935 she saved up enough money to buy three shares worth $180.00\u2026.and she never sold them. Despite the stock skyrocketing in price, she never increased her lifestyle. She never bought expensive things. She lived in a small apartment for most of her life. And during her retirement from the company, she\u2019d spend some money on travel and would actively volunteer\u2026but she never touched the principle of her investment. And that led a $7,000,000 donation for college scholarships when she passed away.\n\nThis is really the power of three things: One, it doesn\u2019t matter how much you make, it matters how much you save. In all of our examples, they didn\u2019t have an extremely high income - they just saved and invested consistently. Two, time in the market - not timing the market, is most important. These were people who didn\u2019t think \u201cthe stock market is too high, I\u2019m waiting for a crash\u201d - they just bought and held. And three: the power of long term compound interest.

The real answer is, WHY NOT? But in all seriousness, there\u2019s no downside to having all these cards, so I may as well get them. The majority of them cost nothing to keep open so I keep them around. The thing is, when you\u2019re building your credit, the credit scoring algorithms look at four major factors when determining how you can get a high credit score:\n\nThe first is average length of credit history. The longer you have your credit lines open, the longer you have those accounts established, and the more it weighs in your favor of having a high score. \n\nThe second factor credit scoring companies look for is amount of credit available to you. Generally, the more credit at your disposal, the less likely you are to use all of it, and the lower your debt-to-credit ratio is. \n\nThis brings me to the third scoring method\u2026how much credit you actually use, compared to how much you have - this is called the utilization rate. Spending $1000 on a $1000 card looks like you\u2019ve just maxed out your credit line, and banks see this as a high risk that you\u2019ll default because you needed to use all the credit available to you. But spending $1000 on a card with a $50,000 limit just means you\u2019ve spent only 2% of what\u2019s available, and therefore you\u2019re a much smaller risk to credit card companies.\n\nFourth is how often you pay on time. This goes without saying, don\u2019t pay your credit cards off late and pay them in full by the time they\u2019re due. \n\nSo because of these four reasons, I see ZERO downsides to keeping multiple cards. \n\nBut the real reason I have so many cards isn\u2019t necessarily to have a high credit limit, even though that\u2019s nice\u2026it\u2019s to get those sweet, sweet bonus points, also known as credit card churning. I opened a chase sapphire reserve for 100,000 points. I opened a chase sapphire preferred for 50,000 points. I opened an American Express Gold for 50,000 points, an American Express Platinum for 60,000 points, an American Express Starwood\u2019s Card for 30,000 points, and a Chase Ink Business Preferred for 100,000 points\u2026this equates to 390,000 bonus points just for opening up credit cards. \n\nThe trick here is not to be smart once you have all this money available to you on credit. These credit card companies expect that the majority of people will spend extra money on the card, take their time to pay it off, and the interest the customer pays will eventually outweigh the meager 100,000 points the credit card company gives you\u2026that\u2019s how these companies stay in business and lure in customers\u2026but I\u2019d expect we\u2019re all smarter than that. Instead, you\u2019ll meet the minimum spend through your normal spending, you\u2019ll pay it off in full, and you\u2019ll be a responsible citizen with your card by not carrying a balance. In return for being a responsible adult, you\u2019ll get rewarded with a LOT of perks without paying a dime in interest. Use this as an excuse to take a vacation for free, or save them up for something special.

Lets crunch the numbers to determine which is actually less expensive, and which factors to consider to determine which is right for you. Enjoy!

But you can\u2019t deny that many high-profile people just end up renting their homes\u2026why is this?\n\nLets first start with owning a home. Many people just look at the cost of rent, then look at the mortgage payment - see it\u2019s maybe a little more, but think \u201cI can own this for just a little bit more, buying is a waste!\u201d However, the actual cost of owning is home is much greater than just your mortgage payment. You also have property taxes, insurance, and repairs to take into consideration - not to mention the opportunity cost of the money that you invest into your home. \n\nPurely for cash flow purposes, renting is usually cheaper. Even though you don\u2019t get the tax benefits of owning, usually renting and investing elsewhere is cheapest month-to-month out of pocket. Not only is it \u201ccheaper\u201d for cash flow purposes, but you have the mobility to pick up and leave when your rent is up. You\u2019re not responsible for maintenance. You don\u2019t need to bother selling it when you\u2019re done. You just pick up and go. You can also invest your money invested elsewhere, potentially making you even more money. \n\nBut in terms of NET cost over 7 years, the lease will cost you MORE than owning a home, realizing the tax benefits, seeing some appreciation, and paying down your loan. \n\nSo what\u2019s the advantage of renting?\n\nFirst of all, this assumes the market goes up over 7 years\u2026if the market is about the same price or drops, you\u2019ll actually come out AHEAD by renting. You\u2019ll also come out ahead by renting if you can make more than a 12% return on your down payment elsewhere. You\u2019ll also come out AHEAD by renting if you\u2019re only going to live in the home for 1-3 years and plan to sell it, unless you get lucky with a rapidly appreciating market. So it takes a lot of averages and assumptions to really decide which one is better. \n\nThe biggest downside I see with buying is that it ties up capital that COULD be deployed in a business that would generate higher returns. For someone who only wants to buy an live there a few years and sell, it\u2019s dangerous to assume the market will continue going upward in a short period of time. So the \u201ccost\u201d of renting is sometimes much cheaper than just owning the home for a few years. \n\nBUT\u2026.for those who plan to live in their home for more than 7 years or so, generally speaking buying is better. You basically lock in your cost of ownership by buying - you won\u2019t have rent increases, you won\u2019t have a landlord telling you what to do, and you have total control over the property. You also get the tax benefits of owning and you can build up equity in an appreciating asset. \n\nHowever, you\u2019re tying yourself down and if you decide to sell after a year or two, you\u2019ll likely take a loss unless your market appreciates in price enough to make up the closing costs and commissions. But long term, owning will be cheaper if you intend to live there long term.\n\nSo like I said, determining which is cheaper really depends on quite a few variables - short term, it\u2019s generally better to rent. Long term, generally better to own. And the longer you stay in a property, the more it usually makes sense just to own it. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-11T22:30:00Z","tags":["buying vs renting","buy vs rent","buy vs rent house","khan academy","buy or rent a home","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate investing","real estate investing 2018","investing strategies 2018","how to invest in real estate","investing in real estate 101","real estate investing strategies 2018","stock market 101","how to be a real estate agent","real estate investing for beginners","real estate audiobook","grant cardone","real estate investing with no money","passive income"],"title":"Which is Cheaper: BUYING or RENTING a house?

This is why it\u2019s easy to be excited about buying a new item, or getting a raise, but then a few months later, it just seems like the new normal and nothing has really changed. Then it takes even MORE to get the same excitement, to which then the same happens - you eventually return to baseline. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve found is that, while money and having a high income DOES make life substantially \u201ceasier\u201d in certain aspects, it doesn\u2019t by itself contribute to becoming a happier person. In the end, happiness is really just a state of mind - and tying your success to your happiness is a precarious place to be. The reason why is that when this happens, you don\u2019t control your happiness; external factors do. And this means you become reliant on making a certain amount of income, having certain objects, or taking on an identity to be \u201chappy.\u201d And when these don\u2019t fall into place, you\u2019re lost. So detaching money from happiness ultimately just ends up making you a happier person\u2026I think? :P\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-09T22:30:01Z","tags":["does money buy happiness","does money buy happiness debate","real estate agent","real estate coach","how i became a millionaire","passive income 101","passive income","how to make passive income","real estate investing 101","real estate investing","how to invest in real estate","how to buy rental property","real estate agent 2018","stock market 101","stock market investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","real estate agent strategies","dropshipping","sebastian gheorghiu"],"title":"Will $60,000\/month make you happy?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vhGRxD3n7hM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vhGRxD3n7hM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vhGRxD3n7hM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vhGRxD3n7hM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vhGRxD3n7hM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M26S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"301","dislikeCount":"42","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"853","viewCount":"17683"}},{"id":"_L5pMYWnHZQ","snippet":{"description":"This is such a simple concept that so many people miss entirely or just don\u2019t fully understand.

And this is what many current millionaires understand really, really well. There\u2019s only so much they can generate on their own before they reach a plateau in terms of performance, and this is where this strategy kicks in and takes over. \n\nConsider this - even if you\u2019re able to SAVE $50,000 per year after your expenses and taxes, it\u2019s going to take you 20 YEARS to become a millionaire. So what do most financially successful people do, instead? They get help\u2026in the form of using their money to work for them. \n\nThis is what nearly EVERY SINGLE financially successful person I\u2019ve ever met does. No matter WHAT you do, whether you\u2019re paid hourly, paid on a commission, or paid passively\u2026beyond a certain level, you will NEED to put your money to work to make you more money. The money you save is most valuable money you have, and it has the potential to grow far beyond what you can earn with your time. \n\nAnd this is what almost every single millionaire I\u2019ve ever met does\u2026they will work, save, invest, repeat. But the \u201cinvest\u201d part snowballs to a point where eventually, you make more money through your investments than you can possibly earn with your time. Even now, I\u2019d say the money I make from buying properties and INVESTING almost matches the income I make as a Real Estate Agent\u2026.this is powerful, because I\u2019ve essentially almost doubled my income without doubling my work load. I\u2019m sure over the next few years, I\u2019ll actually start making MORE investing than I can earn with my own time as a Realtor. \n\nSo you will, too, at some point in time, do the same thing if you want to expedite your wealth. Utilize your money as a TOOL to generate more money in the form of investing. And this, unfortunately is what most people miss - even though it\u2019s obvious, only a small percentage of people actually do this. So just by knowing and being conscious of this with your money, you\u2019ll be in a better position to take advantage of this and eventually have your investments working for you, instead of you working for money. Investing, above everything else, is going to be the clear path to be independently, financially independently. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-07T22:30:02Z","tags":["how to be a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","your money or your life","how to make passive income","passive income 101","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in 2018","investing strategies 2018","real estate investing with no money","investing for beginners","investing in stocks for beginners","investing in real estate","investing 101","financial education","ryan scribner","tai lopez","grant cardone","real estate investing 2018","real estate agent"],"title":"The ONE thing most Millionaires do that makes them Millionaires","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_L5pMYWnHZQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_L5pMYWnHZQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_L5pMYWnHZQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_L5pMYWnHZQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_L5pMYWnHZQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"453","dislikeCount":"29","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1432","viewCount":"25518"}},{"id":"AMIO8PNSmV4","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s a way you can invest in real estate with as little as $100\u2026it\u2019s a REIT. But how does this compare with just straight up owning rental property, and is it even worth owning a REIT in the first place? So lets analyze the pros\/cons of each!

By investing in this company, you thereby are entitled to some of their profit, in the form of dividends.\n\nPros to doing this:\n-There\u2019s pretty much zero barrier to entry. Anyone with $50-$100 can invest. \n-It\u2019s also really easy to buy into a REIT\u2026open up any stock trading website or app, and boom, you\u2019re done. You don\u2019t need to go out looking for properties that cash flow for weeks or months.\n-There\u2019s also no management aspect of this. With a REIT you don\u2019t do ANYTHING. You just buy it and forget it\u2026done.\n-It\u2019s also really, really easy to sell\u2026no need to pay a 5% commission, no need to show your home to buyers, no need to negotiate prices\u2026it\u2019s just as easy as buying a REIT. You just click \u201csell\u201d and you have your money almost immediately. \n-With a REIT, you\u2019re really well diversified. \n\nNegatives:\n-How the income YOU get is taxed\u2026you get paid in the form of a dividend. This is usually an amount that\u2019s paid out quarterly, but it\u2019s taxed as though it\u2019s earned income, which means it\u2019s taxed at your highest marginal rate. \n-Because REITs pay high dividends, they usually don\u2019t increase much in price.\n-The third downside is that you don\u2019t have any control over your investment\u2026unlike a property where you can pick the color to paint the walls, how to remodel the property, or how to manage the property and how much to rent it for - with a REIT, you have zero control. \n-You also can\u2019t build equity in a REIT like you can with real estate.\n\nInvestment Real Estate Downsides:\n-High barrier to entry\u2026you generally need a large down payment and will need to have the income to support the loan payments.\n-The second downside to owning real estate is the time commitment. Finding the right deal is essential - and it can take a lot of time. Then you have the time aspects of managing a rental property. \n-Lack of immediate liquidity. I can\u2019t just sell my property for top dollar within a day - it just doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nRental Real Estate upsides:\n-You can leverage your money. While yes, a REIT does invest in leveraged properties and you own a portion of that, generally the returns aren\u2019t as high as when you do it yourself. \n-Your income from rents is generally tax free. When owning physical real estate, you can depreciate the cost of the property against your rental income. Compare this to paying 22-37% taxes on dividend income.\n-You have total control over your investment. This means you can find a really, really good undervalued deal where you make a significant amount of money. \n-You\u2019re able to borrow against the equity in your home - completely tax free.\n\nSo at the end of the day, this is what it really comes to\u2026\n\nIf your goal is long term equity, owning physical real estate is the way to go. When you buy an investment property, you\u2019re continuously building equity in a tangible asset. Having more equity in your asset also gives you the ability to refinance over time and use the proceeds to buy additional assets and grow your portfolio. More work, more time involved, more money long term. However, if you have a little money and want some exposure to real estate, a REIT could be a nice way to diversify. However, since dividends are taxed as ordinary income, it\u2019s best to hold the REIT in a tax advantaged account like a 401k or Roth IRA to avoid paying taxes. This way you get all the benefits of having exposure to real estate, without the tax consequences of paying a stupid amount of taxes on it.

Enjoy! Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan More information below...\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nAnytime you set a goal in real estate, it\u2019s really important to work backwards in order to find out how to hit that goal. Figure out how much real estate you\u2019ll need to sell, the average price of a home in your area, and how many people you\u2019ll need to meet to make those numbers work. For simplicity sake, lets just say you need $5,000,000 in sales to net $100k. Look at the average purchase price of the area you want to work in, or are working in, and divide that number by $5,000,000. We will assume you will need 14 homes to hit $100k in net commission at $350k average price. The next step is to figure out how you\u2019re going to sell 14 homes\u2026\n\nAnd we\u2019ll break it down further. In order to hit high sales numbers, you WILL need to prospect for business. It\u2019s said that you\u2019ll generally make about 1 sale for every 180 people you come in contact with. And by contact, I mean you actually have a conversation with them about real estate for the purposes of finding out if they want to buy or sell. \n\nSo with that, to sell 14 homes\u2026you\u2019ll need to meet 2,520 contacts over the course of a year, or 210 per month. This also works out to be an average of 7 contacts per DAY. So how can you do this? Here\u2019s my ideal recommendation:\n\nGoing after expired listings:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0tLnH96hRqE&t=25s\n\nI\u2019d also recommend holding open houses every single Saturday and Sunday. Just by doing this, you could easily meet another 3-20+ people in a few hours:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qh-EeRId3OU&t=77s\n\nThe third option you can do is going after homes under construction. Walk in, find the contractor, and find out if the home is going to be sold or rented\u2026if so, introduce yourself to the owner. Find out how much they want to list it for and bam\u2026use this as an opportunity to pitch your services as a Realtor:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5Zqvhh0VHtg&t=1004s\n\nFinally, you can cold call or door knock for business. Especially if you\u2019re aiming for a lofty goal of $100k in your first year, door knocking or cold calling will be pretty much required as you\u2019re growing your business. You\u2019ll need to build up a lot of contacts and a lot of experience quickly, and this is one of the best ways of doing this by just using your time. \n\nBut one of the largest components of all of this\u2026FOLLOW UP. Don\u2019t be afraid of being annoying. You will NEED to do this\u2026yes, some people will get annoyed, but those aren\u2019t the people you want to work with, anyway. Because if you don\u2019t consistently follow up, you will lose out on business and all of your hard work will be for nothing.\n\nDoing this consistently should lead you to about 14 sales, which should equate to $100k given a $350,000 sale price at 2.5% commission. If you\u2019re in a higher priced area, this could actually lead to way more. \n\nNow with something like this, a few things that I should mention:\n\nWhen you\u2019re just starting out, there\u2019s a steep learning curve. You will mess up. You will make mistakes. That\u2019s part of the process. It\u2019s okay - it will take some time to find a balance of what works best with your style and personality. And finally, with something like this, personal work ethic matters a lot. The reason why most people fail is because they expect quick commissions or get into it for the wrong reasons. If you\u2019re interested in real estate and really enjoy it, and have the self motivation to continue pushing through the times when you\u2019re frustrated and feel like you\u2019re not getting anywhere, you\u2019ll do well. But how hard you push yourself will make the difference -you need to be consistent, and you need to be dedicated to hitting your numbers. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-05-02T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate coach","how to be a real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","real estate investing","real estate agent training","real estate agent career","real estate agent beginner","how to invest in real estate","real estate agent tips","how to make money in real estate","real estate agent 101","real estate investing 101","real estate agent 2018","cold calling","door knocking","cold calling real estate","bryan casella"],"title":"Step By Step: How to make $100k your FIRST YEAR as a Real Estate Agent","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nj4ep8A3EIM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nj4ep8A3EIM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nj4ep8A3EIM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nj4ep8A3EIM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nj4ep8A3EIM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT20M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"833","dislikeCount":"145","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"17563","viewCount":"339496"}},{"id":"EFaOBKSfweA","snippet":{"description":"Let\u2019s debunk some common myths about real estate investing, and share what it\u2019s ACTUALLY like, no sugar coating - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat \/ Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJeremy\u2019s Channel:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCnMn36GT_H0X-w5_ckLtlgQ\n\nFinancial Growth Conference:\nhttps:\/\/financial-education2.teachable.com\/p\/building-wealth-conference-2019-presented-by-financial-education\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nFirst expectation: Real estate investing is passive.  \nThe reality is that creating the type of rental property to the point where it\u2019s passive income takes a LOT of work. But the work is, at times, still ongoing. Eventually you\u2019ll have a vacancy. Eventually you\u2019ll need to fix things up again. Nothing will last forever. Sure, you can get a property manager who\u2019ll handle much of this for you - but you will need to do SOME work yourself, even if it\u2019s as small as choosing between finishes or approving bids on work. It won\u2019t be an insane amount of work, but it will be something. So yes, real estate CAN be fairly passive\u2026but it\u2019s not passive if you don\u2019t put in the work UPFRONT. \n\nSecond Expectation: In order to invest in real estate, you need to do the repairs yourself or be a good handyman. \nThe reality is that I can\u2019t do anything besides change a lightbulb. While I do know some landlords who do the work themselves to save the money, this is absolutely not a requirement - and depending on how much your time is worth, it\u2019s often cheaper just to pay someone else to do it the right way. It\u2019s also worth noting that since all these repairs are a write off, you can write off the costs against your income\u2026but, if you do the work YOURSELF, you cannot deduct the cost of YOUR OWN LABOR. \n\nThird Expectation: It takes a lot of money to start. \nThe reality is that it often takes 10%-25% down to begin investing in real estate. This COULD be a lot depending on your definition of \u201c a lot,\u201d and also on your area. Buying a property in Los Angeles would be significantly more expensive than in Kentucky, for instance. Where one person might be able to buy a property for $20,000 down, someone else might need $200,000. \n\nFourth Expectation is that it\u2019s often like the TV shows. \nThe Reality is that it\u2019s NOTHING like what they portray on TV. Oftentimes those TV shows will be loosely scripted around creating drama and creating a show that\u2019s actually interesting enough to watch all the way through. Every episode needs a goal, a problem that arises, a solution to that problem, and then a resolution at the end. The real life problems that come up just aren\u2019t that exciting or interesting. It\u2019s often boring and mundane. \n\nThe fifth expectation is that you\u2019ll make a lot of money investing in real estate.\nThe reality is that oftentimes one property won\u2019t make you rich. Most mom and pop landlords won\u2019t make a lot early on, but as they scale up, they can earn a significant amount of money from a lot of smaller sources. This is how many landlords start making money, enough to quit their jobs and invest in real estate full time. It\u2019s growing your portfolio over one or two DECADES and accumulating those properties that might make you only $900 a month\u2026.but buy one of those every 18 months, and in 15 years you\u2019re making $9000 per MONTH. That\u2019s how most landlords make their money, and make a LOT of it. But the beginning will be slow and frustrating until you begin adding more and more to your portfolio. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-29T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing audiobook","real estate investing 2018","real estate expectation reality","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","investing 101","passive income 101","passive income strategies","passive income 2018","passive income ideas","passive income online","what its like being a landlord","bigger pockets"],"title":"Real Estate Investing for Beginners: Expectation vs Reality","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EFaOBKSfweA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EFaOBKSfweA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EFaOBKSfweA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EFaOBKSfweA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EFaOBKSfweA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M27S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1647","dislikeCount":"605","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"28452","viewCount":"864501"}},{"id":"xP8XOqR0FUE","snippet":{"description":"Meet Kevin David, ODi Productions, and Mike Vestil - four entrepreneurs who have each carved their own path to passive income and online business.

So what\u2019s going to happen - will prices decline as rates go up? Or is it better to buy more rates just get more expensive? Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nInterest rates directly affect how expensive it is to own real estate. As interest rates rise, your affordability goes down since that same loan becomes more expensive. Historically, us \u201cfreaking out\u201d about higher interest rates is rather comical. In the 1980\u2019s, the fixed 30-year mortgage rate was 18%. By the 1990\u2019s, it fell to about 10%\u2026and since then, it\u2019s steadily decreased. So what about real estate prices at that time, how did they fare when interest rates were 18%?\n\nWell, the surprisingly - it didn\u2019t have much of an impact on prices. Development began to halt as borrowing became too risky for new projects, but dwindling supply kept prices rather intact. And historically speaking, interest rates have very little direct impact on property values\u2026and the reality is that there are many other factors at play which determine the value of real estate. One interesting note is that usually interest rates are increased in either an improving economy, or to combat rising inflation. \n\nIn an improving economy, people tend to be doing better as well - unemployment is lower, wages are increasing, people make more money, people spend more money. This bodes well for real estate prices as people have more discretionary income.\n\nIf interest rates are increased to combat rising inflation, because real estate is a hard asset that typically increases in value at the same rate as inflation due to build costs also going up, sometimes the increase in property value from inflation actually outweighs any potential negative decrease caused by rising rates, and the net result can be positive for real estate. \n\nAnd as they say, when it comes to real estate, it\u2019s location location location\u2026a bigger determination of prices is still the age old supply and demand. Local market health is a much stronger indication of market price versus interest rates alone. \n\nMy prediction is that we\u2019ll continue to see upward pressure on real estate prices, even as interest rates slowly rise. Now the FED isn\u2019t so stupid as to raise rates an absurd amount as to shock the market, they\u2019ll do so in small, easy to swallow increases where it\u2019s more like sitting in a simmering pot vs being tossed in a boiling vat of water. It\u2019ll be so gradual that we\u2019ll barely notice it over the next few years. \n\nSo with that said\u2026historically, no, rising interest rates have no correlation on real estate prices - even though, you\u2019d think it would. But rising interest rates are more of an economic symptom of a healthy market, than the direct cause of that. So for anyone out there like me who was curious or concerned about this\u2026probably no need to be concerned. Buy what you can afford, buy with the intention of keeping it long term\u2026and hold. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-25T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate 2018","real estate investing strategy","real estate crash","real estate market","real estate agent","stock market crash","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing explained","real estate explained","real estate 101","stock market 101","economy collapse","economy 2018","economy news","real estate mentor","real estate coach","passive income","passive income 2018","grant cardone","biggerpockets","investing","real estate crash 2018"],"title":"Are we about to see a DROP in Real Estate Prices?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/32TKdufTiQE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/32TKdufTiQE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/32TKdufTiQE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/32TKdufTiQE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/32TKdufTiQE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M2S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"604","dislikeCount":"206","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2666","viewCount":"92946"}},{"id":"7Ct3B7ZeQ8c","snippet":{"description":"Introducing IGTV: Instagram\u2019s long form video platform. But how will this do compared to YouTube, and should YouTube be worried? These are my thoughts. Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nFor those who aren\u2019t aware, Instagram just announced that it\u2019s now trying to take a shot at YouTube by creating IGTV, an app that allows vertically oriented videos, full-screen, up to 4k resolution, and as long as 60 minutes.\n\nIf Instagram does this properly, YouTube has a reason to be concerned - and lets be real, some healthy competition could be good for YouTube to further cater to its users and improve the site. But in order for this to work for Instagram, a few things need to happen:\n\nOne: It needs to allow horizontal videos. While vertical videos are ok, and we\u2019re used to it right now on Instagram for short form videos, it\u2019s a narrow range of view. If they can copy YouTube\u2019s current format to be able to change the layout, they\u2019ll be just fine. But ONLY allowing for portrait mode on instagram, in my opinion, is a narrow-minded move.\n\nTwo: They need to allow monetization. This will be their biggest obstacle, and also their biggest opportunity. Otherwise, I\u2019m concerned instagram videos will take a backseat to YouTube until creators have an incentive to prioritize one over the other. \n\nThree: They need to allow a user-friendly algorithm to give you the content YOU want to watch, not the content THEY want you watch. Because they have the user-generated data behind Facebook, I\u2019d expect that they can reasonably target the right people for the right videos - potentially more accurately than YouTube. \n\nFour: It would be amazing if allowed in-video tagging. I\u2019d love to be able to watch a video on Instagram, see someone else come up on screen, and be able to click on them and be directed to their instagram page without leaving the video. This is something no one has implemented yet. \n\nFive: Comment ranking would also be pretty important. One of the best parts about YouTube is its community\u2026I\u2019d like to be able to like or dislike comments, maybe in a similar format to Reddit. \n\nSix: Finally, they need to LISTEN to what their use want\u2026which is often just a chronological timeline. Not necessarily an algorithm to favor one post or another, but for a way for us to see ALL of them in the order they\u2019re posted.\n\nIf this happens, I think IGTV can quickly become a new and invigorating new platform for video! \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-21T21:00:02Z","tags":["IGTV","Instagram TV","IGTV Instagram","Instagram vs YouTube","IGTV 2018","instagram 2018","instagram video","how to grow on youtube","youtube","marques brownlee","graham stephan","gary vee","social media","youtube 2018"],"title":"IGTV...is this the end of YouTube?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ct3B7ZeQ8c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ct3B7ZeQ8c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ct3B7ZeQ8c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ct3B7ZeQ8c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ct3B7ZeQ8c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"606","dislikeCount":"51","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"967","viewCount":"21981"}},{"id":"kW76liexoBY","snippet":{"description":"MeetKevin and I discuss the five most profitable renovations you can do when investing in Real Estate to get the highest return possible, whether it\u2019s a rental or flip\u2026Enjoy!

This is often the first thing people look at when checking out a new property. Opening the kitchen and creating an open floor plan is often the easiest \u201cbang for the buck,\u201d but renovating a kitchen doesn\u2019t need to be expensive. Oftentimes painting existing cabinetry and changing the hardware can be sufficient. Sale sections at Home Depot also work well!\n\nSecond: Flooring. Luxury Laminate Flooring is essential, especially in a rental. When flipping real estate, it\u2019s OK to go higher end with real hardwood floors depending on the area - but for a rental, most laminate flooring is just as good, cheaper, and more durable. \n\nThird: Bathrooms. Again, this doesn\u2019t need to be overly expensive. New vanities are fairly inexpensive. You can often keep existing tile and re-glaze it a different color to make it more modern. \n\nFourth: Lighting. Add recessed lighting - It makes a massive difference. If you have popcorn \/ acoustic ceilings, scrape them and add recessed lighting at the same time to save on labor. Dimmable lights also go a long way. \n\nFifth: Landscape. This is frequently overlooked but it\u2019s an easy way to add to the curb appeal on your home and stand out from everything else. For a rental property, DO NOT plant intricate landscape that tenants could neglect. Instead, chose tenant-proof landscape options: gravel, mulch, and low-maintenance greenery. Succulents are great. \n\nSixth Bonus Tip: Baseboard. 4\u201d baseboard around the new floors and around windows\/doors adds a sophisticated, upscale vibe to the home for an extremely inexpensive price. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-20T22:30:02Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing 101","how to invest in real estate","real estate 101","real estate renovation","renovating a property","renovating a house","renovating a kitchen","renovating a bathroom","real estate investing for beginners","real estate agent","real estate agent career","real estate agent day in the life","passive income","passive income 2018","how to become a millionaire","home remodeling","most profitable renovations","investing 101","meet kevin"],"title":"Real Estate Investing 101: Top 5 Most PROFITABLE Renovations","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kW76liexoBY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kW76liexoBY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kW76liexoBY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kW76liexoBY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kW76liexoBY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M15S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"925","dislikeCount":"248","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"15946","viewCount":"382843"}},{"id":"CnStZ1F4m7M","snippet":{"description":"These are the 5 things successful people do in their 20\u2019s, and why they\u2019re so important for you to implement as well - enjoy!

Click the like button. Just kidding, the first thing to consider in your 20\u2019s is learning to invest in yourself. While it often sounds cheesy, YOU are the investment with the highest ROI. Think of it almost like having a dull knife - while it still probably works, it\u2019s not as good as it COULD be. So investing in yourself is a little like sharpening the blade to make it more effective at its purpose. Investing in yourself doesn\u2019t need to be crazy complicated or expensive. It could be learning a new skill, reading a book on a topic you\u2019re interested in, or investing your own time to understand something firsthand. At this time in your life, your skills are pretty much limitless\u2026whatever you want to learn, it\u2019s already there at your fingertips. \n\n#2 Never get complacent and seek to constantly improve. You are always going to be able to do better and enhance your skills - there is always something more you can do as you get better at something. Complacency is probably one of the worst things to fall into, this literally ruins whatever momentum you\u2019ve built up. There will always be a more effective way to do something - there will always be something new to try. And while the saying is very true, don\u2019t fix what isn\u2019t broken - things WILL change. What works now likely won\u2019t work in 10 years. There will be adjustments that will need to be made. And by pushing yourself a little further and improving, you\u2019ll stay at the top of the curve. \n\nThe reality is that if you don\u2019t innovate or progress, there will be someone else who WILL\u2026and that person will eventually outpace you. Because as you stay still, the world begins moving and changing without you and will soon leave you behind. So always aim to constantly be learning and improving, no matter what you\u2019re doing. \n\n#3 TAKE RISKS. Your 20\u2019s are the best time for you to make the riskier business moves or take chances you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily take. This is because while you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s, chances are you still have quite a few fallbacks in the event you fail. It\u2019s still socially acceptable to move back in with your parents if you need to. It\u2019s okay to sleep on a futon mattress and eat ramen. And chances are, you don\u2019t have the financial obligations that someone older would have. You likely don\u2019t have the wife, kids, and mortgage to consider - because of this, now is the perfect time to take the risks that could potentially propel you much further in your career. \n \n#4 Focus on what you\u2019re most excited about. Your 20\u2019s are the best time to do work on the projects you have fun with. By doing something you enjoy, it makes it so much easier to do well and excel in it. There\u2019s nothing more disheartening than being forced into something you don\u2019t want to do, and that alone has the potential to crush your enthusiasm and potential. Especially when you\u2019re young and everything is new, you have the advantage of having that beginners excitement that\u2019ll often push you beyond everyone else. Combine this with doing something you enjoy, and it\u2019ll be much easier to break past any obstacles. \n\n#5 Learn from your failures. This is easily the most important from all of this. You will fail along the way and you will make mistakes, but how you handle those mistakes is entirely within your control. In fact, if you go without failure, this could even be WORSE than having failed, because it\u2019ll give you a false sense of confidence that anything you do will work, which is just not plausible long term. And this is easily the most important thing to do in your 20\u2019s, because this will set the precedent for everything else going forward. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-18T22:30:02Z","tags":["how to be successful","how to be successful in life","how to be successful in business","how to be rich in your 20s","how I became a millionaire","rich people habits","habits of rich people","habits of successful people","7 habits of highly effective people","think and grow rich","how to become rich","millionaire lifestyle","how to get wealthy","what rich people do","rich vs poor","rich dad poor dad","passive income","entrepreneur","real estate investor","real estate 101","real estate agent"],"title":"The 5 Things Successful People Do In Their 20\u2019s","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CnStZ1F4m7M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CnStZ1F4m7M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CnStZ1F4m7M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CnStZ1F4m7M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CnStZ1F4m7M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M3S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"334","dislikeCount":"38","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2223","viewCount":"31995"}},{"id":"fVIe1pBtfZ8","snippet":{"description":"Fundrise. Real Estate Investing with some pretty substantial returns. Is it worth it? Is it legit? Should you invest in it? Here\u2019s what I discovered. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nFundrise is a real estate investing service that allows you access to private market real estate deals that they say should \u201cdeliver superior risk-adjusted returns over time versus a portfolio of publicly traded stocks.\u201d The biggest difference is that Fundrise is NOT publicly traded on a stock exchange, but they are publicly available. By being publicly available, this means that anyone can invest because they comply with the SEC disclosure regulations, and by doing so, they don\u2019t limit themselves to accredited investors\n\nSo there\u2019s gotta be a catch, RIGHT? So I read through all 225 pages of their fine print. Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nFirst concern is lack of liquidity. By investing through Fundrise, you\u2019re pretty much tying up your money for 5 years. Even though they say that if you pull out your money prior to then at their redemption rate, which is 97% at its lowest - they still make it very clear there is no guaranteed return of your investment with no immediate plan to buy back your shares. As from their fine print: \u201cIf we do not successfully implement a liquidity transaction, you may have to hold your investment for an indefinite period.\u201d It goes on to say \u201cFundrise Advisors, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, has the authority, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions by each shareholder during any quarter, including if the Manager deems such action to be in the best interest of the shareholders as a whole.\u201d\n\nSecond concern I have is their fees\u2026which they say are 1% annually. This seems a bit high compared to other lower cost options, namely a Vanguard REIT - which charges 0.26% annually as a fee, or 74% LESS than FundRise. But, in FundRise\u2019s defense, they\u2019re a smaller company which invests in riskier assets that should generate higher returns to compensate to the higher fee. \n\nMy third concern - and also a major reason I\u2019d never invest in this - is that the dividends are taxes as ordinary income at your ordinary income rate. One of the many advantages of holding long term investments is capturing the long term capital gains tax rate - this is typically SIGNIFICANTLY lower than the tax rate for ordinary income.\n\nMy fourth concern is how this investment will hold up in a down market. While I agree with their market strategy and can\u2019t find any faults with where they\u2019re investing, at some point there will be a plateau in growth, while these returns are possible NOW, I\u2019m unsure how sustainable these are long term - and again, if you want to re-balance your portfolio, you may be stuck with your investment. And they very much acknowledge this in their fine print: \u201cThe significant growth we have experienced, particularly with respect to assets under management and revenues, will be difficult to sustain.\u201d\n\nFifth, I\u2019m always a little hesitant about companies that give referral fees. While often it\u2019s a nice gesture to give customers SOMETHING for referring business, and I totally agree with this business model, in the age of the internet, there will be people out there who will write falsely positive reviews just to get the referral bonus. When this happens, honest criticism becomes buried or harder to find. \n\nFor someone wanting exposure to real estate, I believe there are many other REIT options out there that offer the liquidity and tax treatment that put you in a much better position, even if they\u2019ll give you slightly lower returns. I\u2019d rather sacrifice a percent or two JUST to have access to my money when I need it. So overall, no it\u2019s not a scam - and there are some positives about what they\u2019re doing - but from what I see, the downsides just outweigh the upside, rendering other options as more attractive when put side by side. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-15T22:30:00Z","tags":["Fundrise","fundrise review","fundrise real estate investing","real estate investing","reit","fundrise returns","fundrise investment","fundrise passive income","fundrise review 2018","fundrise starter portfolio","fundrise real estate","fundrise explained","Real estate investing","real estate investing 2018","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing with no money","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing for beginners","Real estate investment trust","passive income 2018"],"title":"The TRUTH about Fundrise Real Estate Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fVIe1pBtfZ8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fVIe1pBtfZ8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fVIe1pBtfZ8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fVIe1pBtfZ8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M31S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1634","dislikeCount":"229","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"33645","viewCount":"393890"}},{"id":"ukaWAjgkH9M","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s exactly how you can begin building your credit score - without paying any interest, for completely free, and in only 20 minutes. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nSo here\u2019s what you do to build up your credit, and this is how easy it really is:\n\nStep 1: Go to your bank - really doesn\u2019t matter which one - and get what\u2019s called a \u201csecured credit card.\u201d It\u2019s secured because they \u201csecure\u201d the card with your own money which is put as collateral against your credit line. That\u2019s as simple as it is. Now if you can qualify for an unsecured credit card, meaning all you do is apply and they give you a card without a deposit, all the better - this isn\u2019t too common for people just starting out, but it does happen. It\u2019s very important that when you do this, make sure the credit card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee. The goal of this should be to build your credit entirely for free - and annual fees are usually a total waste, anyway, unless you\u2019re receiving big rewards, which isn\u2019t going to happen when you\u2019re just starting out - so avoid anything like that. \n\nStep 2: This is all common sense. But pay off the card on time. Just charge some minimal stuff to it and pay it off when it\u2019s due - ideally pay it off in full. You do not need to carry a balance and pay interest to improve your credit score - this is a myth and it makes zero difference. Again, the goal is this is that it should be free - so don\u2019t give the credit card companies any of your money. Pay off the bill in full. And you don\u2019t need to charge a ton of money to the card, either. I just recommend putting small charges on it - even if it\u2019s only the occasional gas bill when filling up your car, or when you get some dinner - just minor things. \n\nStep 3: Do this for 6-8 months. Charge a few things to the card, then pay it off in full. Super easy. Just repeat this each month and you\u2019ll slowly accumulate some credit history. But this is where it starts getting fun\u2026now that you have some history to show \u201cI\u2019ve paid my bill off on time and in full, and I don\u2019t do stupid things with my credit cards,\u201d other companies will begin trusting you with their cards, as well\u2026so after about 6-8 months, it\u2019s time to graduate from your secured card or a \u201cbasic card\u201d to a \u201cReal\u201d credit card. My favorite first unsecured card would probably be the bank of America cash rewards card. \n\nStep 4: Slowly add more cards into the mix. Generally, you can improve your credit score with the more lines of credit you have available to you. It shows banks that you have more access to capital, can handle multiple credit lines successfully, and this makes them more confident when lending you money at a low interest rate. But step 4 is where the fun starts\u2026this is called Credit Card Churning. This is where you\u2019ll get a credit card for the sign up bonus, get the points, and then redeem it for free travel, hotel stays, or really almost anything. If you can get it, I really like the Amex Gold. \n\nStep 5: Just continue paying them all off on time. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s super easy and the entire process of starting shouldn\u2019t take you longer than about 20 minutes of your time. By far this will be the most productive and profitable 20 minutes of your time in your LIFE if you don\u2019t already have a credit card, or aren\u2019t yet old enough to get a card - just do this the week you turn 18 and you\u2019ll be in great ship to later invest in real estate, get the best deals on just about any loan out there, and just be a responsible adult. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-13T22:32:12Z","tags":["credit card","how to build your credit","how to improve your credit score","credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","credit card 101","credit score 101","credit score hacks","credit score to buy a house","how to build your credit score fast","how to build your credit with a credit card","how to apply for a credit card","how to leverage real estate","how to buy real estate","how to improve your credit score without debt","CREDIT SCORE FREE","creditkarma","creditsesame"],"title":"The BEST way to begin building your Credit Score for FREE (For Beginners)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ukaWAjgkH9M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ukaWAjgkH9M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ukaWAjgkH9M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ukaWAjgkH9M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ukaWAjgkH9M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5996","dislikeCount":"622","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"39125","viewCount":"504183"}},{"id":"tax-x9VTz4E","snippet":{"description":"Here is how to live in a place for free without buying, without coming up with the down payment, and best of all is that it\u2019s fairly simple for just about anyone to do\u2026and it\u2019s what I call \u201cRent Hacking.\u201d Enjoy! Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nWhen it comes to living for free by Rent Hacking, the premise is rather simple: Instead of renting a house just for you, you take advantage of the economies of scale and rent a house larger than you\u2019d normally need, and then sublease the extra bedrooms. When done correctly, oftentimes the rents of the other units will cover your entire lease - allowing you to pretty much live for free, sometimes even turning a small profit. All without owning the property, without coming up with a huge down payment, while still keeping the mobility of being able to rent. And\u2026you\u2019ll get to live in a much larger house than you\u2019d be able to afford on your own. \n\nBut, like anything that sounds too good to be true, there are some downsides that I should mention\u2026\n\nThe first, and biggest hurdle to overcome is that oftentimes lease agreements include a no-subletting clause. This means that you CANNOT rent out individual rooms or sublet the property without the owner\u2019s prior written consent. So before doing this, make very clear with the landlord with your intentions - and make sure the lease agreement allows a room subletting clause.\n\nThe second downside, assuming you\u2019ve found a landlord okay with you subletting rooms, is the liability. Generally if you sign the lease, you claim sole liability for anything that happens to the property - and then it\u2019s up to you to go after your tenants to collect for any damages. This can often be mitigated by collecting a security deposit from your room mates, and drafting a strongly worded lease agreement outlining the responsibilities of your co-tenants. This way, you have some recourse in the event of damage. \n\nThe third downside is that you\u2019re responsible for covering the entire amount of rent. When you sign a lease, the landlord doesn\u2019t care who pays and who doesn\u2019t\u2026.but the entire amount of rent will need to be paid on time. \n\nThe fourth obstacle to overcome is proving the financial ability to pay the lease. Many landlords don\u2019t want to take the gamble of assuming you\u2019re going to find renters to cover your $3800 per month cost if you\u2019re only making $2000 per month\u2026any landlord will know that if you don\u2019t find tenants, you can\u2019t pay and you\u2019re screwed. So qualifying for something like this will often include still renting a home within your means.\n\nAnd as a fifth downside is that, yes, you\u2019ll need to live with room mates. This isn\u2019t for everyone, and I get that - but it\u2019s par for the course. \n\nNow if you do decide to do this, definitely screen your room mates HEAVILY. You\u2019ll need them to show proof of financial responsibility, give a security deposit, have a decent credit score or come with a co-signer, and you\u2019ll need to draft your own lease agreement between you and the tenant. But overall, rent hacking is a great starter step for those who want to potentially live for free, or greatly reduce their housing costs to save more money - and this would also be great training for moving up to owning multi-family real estate and graduating to \u201chouse hacking.\u201d\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-11T22:30:00Z","tags":["house hacking","rent hacking","real estate investing 101","real estate investing strategies","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate with no money","real estate investing","real estate agent","real estate mentor","house hacking 101","rent hacking 101","how to live for free","live for free","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing for beginners","real estate strategies","passive income","how to make passive income","how to invest","biggerpockets"],"title":"How to LIVE FOR FREE and House Hack with NO MONEY DOWN: Rent Hacking 101","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tax-x9VTz4E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tax-x9VTz4E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tax-x9VTz4E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tax-x9VTz4E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tax-x9VTz4E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M11S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"564","dislikeCount":"177","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3937","viewCount":"99265"}},{"id":"h8wNUaBgZTk","snippet":{"description":"These are the three ways you can make money owning Rental Real Estate, and exactly how to calculate your cashflow and profit - enjoy!

Anytime you calculate cashflow, you have what\u2019s called the \u201cgross rent.\u201d This is the TOTAL amount of rent you receive. So if you rent out your house for $2000 per month, that $2000 is the \u201cgross rent\u201d - it\u2019s before all of your expenses. And unfortunately, anytime you own real estate, you have recurring expenses - for instance, you have property taxes. Insurance. Repairs. And at some points there will inevitably be vacancy when the house isn\u2019t being rented, but it\u2019s still costing you money to own. These are inevitable. \n\nSo the first step when calculating your net cashflow is to DEDUCT all of those expenses from your total rent. So even though you might get paid $2000 per month, after all of those expenses eating into your money, you might now only be left with $1200. Any time you see real estate returns calculated, it\u2019s usually like this - and this is often referred to at the \u201cnet operating income.\u201d Total rent, minus all expenses = net income. So you\u2019ll need to understand what property tax rates are in your area, how much insurance roughly costs, how much you can realistically get for rent, and how quick you can generally rent out a unit. \n\nOne thing not generally included in those calculations is the mortgage payment. This is because mortgages numbers can vary wildly from person to person depending on how much money you put down, how long of a loan you get, and at what interest rate. But, in almost every situation, your mortgage will be an additional expense in addition to the total rent you receive. \n\nThe second way to make money in real estate is by equity. This means that the value of the property increases because of something you\u2019re doing to it - and there are two ways to make money this way:\n1. The first and the most common is by paying down your loan. In most situations, your loan is broken up in two categories: principle and interest. Any time you pay down the loan every month, part of it pays interest on the total balance of the loan, and the other part pays down the balance - that second part is equity in the property. \n2. The second way to make money with equity is by actively increasing the value of the home. Often this means remodeling the home or adding square footage. And your equity is the difference between the amount you spent, and the new value of the home after renovations. Doing this is also generally pretty predictable. You can see other properties and what they\u2019re selling for, and as long as you make yours similar to that, all things considered, you should get about the same price - and that\u2019s profit. \n\nThe third way to make money in real estate is through appreciation - this means that over time, the value of the property goes up in value. This one is highly location dependent - some areas will go up as fast as inflation, just given the cost of materials to build a house get more expensive over time. This is fine, because it means your money doesn\u2019t really lose any value - it\u2019s simply a preservation of wealth. But other areas will go up substantially more depending on the demand for the area, and how much space is available to build. \n\nUsing a combination of these three can often give you a much, much more accurate idea of your total rate of return much beyond cashflow - and this is how you calculate your returns and evaluate a good deal while owning rental property!\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-08T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing 101","real estate investing stategies","real estate investing 2018","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","how to make money in real estate","real estate wholesaling","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing audiobook","real estate agent training","real estate day in the life","real estate agent tips","passive income 2018","how to make money online","how to be a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","biggerpockets"],"title":"Real Estate Investing: The 3 WAYS to make money owning Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h8wNUaBgZTk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h8wNUaBgZTk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h8wNUaBgZTk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h8wNUaBgZTk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h8wNUaBgZTk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M57S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"404","dislikeCount":"51","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4311","viewCount":"71227"}},{"id":"zqieDyz-nk4","snippet":{"description":"In the age of YouTube, selling information can be one of the most profitable things someone can EVER do. But there are a few distinctions between legitimate information and \u201cFake Gurus\u201d - and it\u2019s this. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re so good at something, why bother teaching people how to do it?\u201d And as much as people don\u2019t want to hear, the reality is that oftentimes - there\u2019s more money in teaching than doing for the simple fact that teaching is widely scaleable. This isn\u2019t a new, revolutionary concept by any means - this has been around forever. But is it reasonable to charge someone to learn something when most of what you need is pretty much available online for free? And I\u2019ll openly admit, I was originally the type that fell into that category - I was, at first, vehemently against selling anything.\n\nThe distinction I wasn\u2019t aware of before I started selling ANYTHING was that selling information didn\u2019t need to be a win-lose transaction. It\u2019s the misinterpretation that it\u2019s okay if you provide as much free value as you can because that\u2019s the right thing to do, but as soon as you begin making any money from it - it\u2019s not okay, and it somehow it becomes a win-lose scenario where the customer loses at your gain. And while this CAN be true in some circumstances, often times the reality is much less black and white.\n\nWhen you think of selling information in the terms of the customer getting more than what they paid for\u2026when you place the CUSTOMER\u2019S EXPERIENCE first as a priority, when you charge a reasonable price where the person paying gets MORE value than what what I get in return from them\u2026the economies of scale means I can get a LOT of happy people paying small amounts, and the overall benefit to ME becomes larger at the same time - and it becomes a win-win scenario. \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve seen, the difference between \u201cfly-by-night snake oil salesmen\u201d and legitimately helpful programs is the customer experience. Is the business or program designed around the CUSTOMER\u2019S EXPERIENCE FIRST, money second? Is it crafted so that customers get MORE than what they pay for? Is the business designed around being a quick money grab, or is the business designed around repeat, happy customers that keep coming back and referring more people over because THEY got more than they paid for? THAT is the right way to sell information.\n\nBut, just like ANY business, there will be unscrupulous people that understand this business model and exploit it for profit - and this is, I believe, the problem. It\u2019s the people who carefully and falsely craft their image around what sells, then they pop up to immediately sell a program or course, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re actually qualified. And it\u2019s THIS that gives everyone else the negative connotation of being a \u201cScam\u201d anytime they decide to sell information, whether or not it\u2019s justified. And it\u2019s unavoidable. You will always have people who purposely seek and target vulnerabilities for their own gain until the end of time. And this is what think we all need to acknowledge, and it\u2019s THIS that makes people skeptical in the first place - not necessarily the sale of information itself. \n\nSo the next time you see someone pitching a product, or a coaching course, or you go through a sales funnel - oftentimes, it\u2019s not a \u201cscam.\u201d And there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the desire to monetize content. While there are plenty of unscrupulous people out there happy to take your money, the blunt reality is that\u2019s just life.  \n\nin order to do well selling information LONG TERM, or selling anything for that matter, you really need to study what people NEED, what their PROBLEMS ARE, how you can SOLVE those problems\u2026and think of what THEIR experience will be FIRST. After you\u2019ve done ALL of that, and after you have a satisfied audience, can you even THINK about monetizing and RECEIVING in return. And that\u2019s often the difference of those going into it purely to extract as much value as fast as possible at someone else\u2019s loss, and those who profit from the scalability of win-win transactions. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading: \nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-06T22:30:01Z","tags":["fake guru","youtube exposed","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate coach","how to make money in real estate","how to make passive income 2018","how to make money online","dropshipping 2018","amazon fba 2018","how to buy real estate","social media marketing 2018","passive income strategies","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 101","real estate agent 101","dropshipping 101","how i became a millionaire","millionaire lifestyle","real estate investing"],"title":"Exposing \"Fake YouTube Gurus\" and the business of Selling Courses","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zqieDyz-nk4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zqieDyz-nk4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zqieDyz-nk4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zqieDyz-nk4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M57S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2388","dislikeCount":"714","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"21022","viewCount":"333346"}},{"id":"5s3n_Gsp1zQ","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s the ACTUAL day-in-the-life example of what it\u2019s like to be a full time real estate investor and real estate agent in Ontario, Canada, featuring Matt McKeever and Jeff Wybo - enjoy!

I\u2019m talking about referring to walking into a home and not liking the paint color. Or not liking the carpet. Or thinking the backsplash is ugly. Too many buyers get caught up in the small, easily changed details that they overlook the bigger picture and pass up an otherwise perfect house for something that can be changed out within a day or two for minimal effort.\n\nAnytime you\u2019re checking out a property, look at 3 things:\n-The location. This is something you\u2019re stuck with and can\u2019t change, regardless of how much money you sink into the property. \n-The second is the floor plan. This CAN be fixed, but it\u2019s just a matter of money. At a certain price, things just don\u2019t make sense to fix - if you\u2019re buying a property for $150,000 under market value, then maybe changing the floorpan can be justified. But if you\u2019re buying at retail level and think the floorplan sucks, then maybe the house isn\u2019t for you.\n-The third, like I mentioned, are cosmetic issues. These can easily be changed for very inexpensively, all things considered. Don\u2019t get caught up here.\n\nThe second thing to know is that when you see a property, it\u2019s usually only during an hour in the day - sometimes a weekend afternoon, or a week day after work. But it\u2019s important to understand wha the house is like throughout the day - sometimes what you could be a quiet weekend street is filled with back-to-back stop and go traffic during the week as everyone gets off work.\n\nThe third is to consider neighbor noise and much like the first example, go there late at night or on weekends and see what the neighbors are like. Trust me on this one\u2026while neighbors come and go, and chances are they won\u2019t be noisy forever, at least have an idea what you\u2019ll be getting into. \n\nFourth thing to consider is commute times. Obviously this won\u2019t matter if you\u2019re buying an investment property, but for anyone else, figure out how long it\u2019ll take you to get to and from work depending on traffic. Especially in Los Angeles, what could be a 15 minute drive at 2am might turn into an hour long commute at 6pm. \n\nFifth, is to always get the home inspected - this is a common sense - I\u2019ve never seen a home NOT be inspected, but I can\u2019t stress the importance of this enough. Get the home inspected, and do as many inspections as you think will be necessary. Even if not to try to get a credit, but just to know what you\u2019re getting into. \n\nFinally\u2026as a 6th bonus tip for reading all the way through, because you\u2019re the real MVP\u2026don\u2019t open up any lines of credit or buy anything expensive 6 months before getting your mortgage. The worst thing you can do right before getting a loan is to get yourself in debt or give the bank any reason not to give you the full amount promised. Always get the mortgage, first - then whatever you decide to do after that is on you. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent: http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life: https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor: https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People: https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich: https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within: https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing: https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve - https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum - https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-06-01T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate coach","real estate mentor","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 2018","real estate agent training","real estate agent career","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest","passive income real estate","how to invest in real estate at a young age","real estate 2018","grant cardone","real estate 101","gary vee"],"title":"5 Things EVERYONE Should Know Before Buying a House!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vkSQ3BiLWZk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vkSQ3BiLWZk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vkSQ3BiLWZk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vkSQ3BiLWZk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vkSQ3BiLWZk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M2S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"525","dislikeCount":"203","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12948","viewCount":"349506"}},{"id":"6zqhvgob-K0","snippet":{"description":"I figured I\u2019d use this opportunity to give everyone a firsthand perspective of what it\u2019s like as a real estate investor, what goes on behind the scenes, and my thought processes when it comes to investing.

Now my strategy when investing in Los Angeles is that the  property should at minimum break even, preferably throw off a little extra cash flow each month, my costs on that property will be FIXED, meaning the mortgage payment won\u2019t change,  I watch the values increase over time, rents increase, and after 3-5 years I start cash flowing a little more. 10 years I start making some decent money, and when the property is paid off, that\u2019s a TON of equity and money I have at my disposal. This is a 30-year play. I\u2019ll end up making more money in equity and appreciation than I ever will from rents, and I can offset those properties against the other ones that make money. \n\nHowever, current prices mean that finding a property that even breaks even is becoming a very difficult task, and I\u2019ve yet to find a good investment that cash flows. Because of this, I\u2019ll hold off investing in real estate until I find the property that works. What does this mean for the real estate market? Well, CNBC recently released an article with the headline that \u201cSouthern California home sales DECLINE!\u201d The article, summed up, says that we\u2019ve seen 10% fewer sales in the last 12 months\u2026but, prices have continued to go up, even as inventory also increases. \n\nIf I can speak from both a real estate agent perspective, a home owner perspective, and a real estate investor perspective, it\u2019s this\u2026it\u2019s not shocking that sales have decreased. This just means that less inventory is being sold and as people hold on to their properties, it\u2019s natural that sales decline. At the same time, we\u2019ve seen prices continuing to increase\u2026over 7% in the last 12 months. But the issue comes here:\n\nFirst, existing homeowners don\u2019t want to sell because they don\u2019t want to give up their low mortgage. If they sell their home, their goes their 3% mortgage interest rate, and they\u2019d be buying something else paying 4.5%. This is a big reason people aren\u2019t selling, and why they\u2019re more likely to keep their home long term. \n\nSecond, people like me are having a difficult time finding something that\u2019ll make money. As an investor, whatever I buy, I need to be sure I can make money from it - both from renovations AND rents. And right now, I\u2019m not finding anything\u2026so makes sense, if I don\u2019t buy something, neither are hundreds of other investors\u2026and sales volume drops. \n\nAs more inventory comes on the market, I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that the ones that are FORCED to sell will lower their price and sell. As more comes on the market, there\u2019s more to chose from, and buyers can afford to be a little more selective. We\u2019re seeing a tail end of flippers and new constructions coming up that were started 2 years ago and just now being finished, hence an increase in inventory. \n\nSo with this, the take away is that you need to have patience and wait for the right deal to come along. Don\u2019t rush into something, don\u2019t force the numbers to work if they don\u2019t, and be ok to hang on the sidelines until you find something that fits your criteria. This is how I\u2019ve operated my real estate investing career over the last 7 years and how I will continue to run my business in the future. Patience, running the numbers, and knowing when to jump at the right opportunity. That\u2019s the best you can do, and that\u2019s exactly what I hope you do to. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-07-30T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2018","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing 101","real estate investing grant cardone","how to make money in real estate","real estate investor","how to invest in real estate for beginners","real estate 101","passive income 2018","passive income ideas","passive income real estate","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","real estate millionaire"],"title":"Investing in Real Estate just got a LOT more difficult\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6zqhvgob-K0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6zqhvgob-K0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6zqhvgob-K0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6zqhvgob-K0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6zqhvgob-K0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1005","dislikeCount":"198","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8644","viewCount":"202035"}},{"id":"JMesQqmoMoY","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered how people buy real estate with no money and no credit?

The way wholesaling works is that you find a distressed seller willing to sell a property under market value. You, as the wholesaler, get that property under contract - and that contract is written to be assignable to someone else. You then go and find someone else to pay MORE for that property than you\u2019re paying, you ASSIGN that contract to the new person at the HIGHER price, and you get paid the difference. \n\nSecond way: Seller Financing. This is when the SELLER \u201cloans\u201d you the property, and instead of paying a mortgage to the bank\u2026your mortgage is directly with the seller. Typically this will only work, however, with owners who own the property outright, AND owners who don\u2019t need the money and are cool just collecting their money every month. For the seller, this typically means they can get a higher rate of return than if they kept the house, it means they\u2019re not responsible for handling repairs, and their return is backed by the house - so they can foreclose if you don\u2019t keep your end of the bargain. \n\nThird way: Bring on an investor or partner. This is something that you can typically do once you get more experienced in real estate\u2026someone brings in the money to the deal, and you do all the work - you find the deal, you renovate it, you add the value, and you manage it for a percentage of ownership. The other person simply just passively invests and that\u2019s that. However, doing this comes with a LOT of risk and you better know what you\u2019re doing. Anytime you have someone else\u2019s money at stake, you better treat it like your own - probably even be MORE careful than you would normally. \n\nFourth way: A lease option. Lease options work like this\u2026lets say I own a property for $100,000 and you want to buy it, but don\u2019t have the money. I\u2019ll say \u201cHow about this. The market value of my house for RENT is $1000 per month. But if you want to buy it, pay me $1200 per month and you have the right to buy the property from me within the next 24 months for $110,000. Your base rent will be $1000, and that extra $200 you pay me every month will be appleid to the purchase price. So after 24 months of paying $200 extra, you will have paid down the purchase price by $4800, meaning the total cost of my property at that time will be $105,200. If you don\u2019t buy it, that\u2019s fine and I got an extra $200 per month. If you do, then that\u2019s the purchase price.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve discussed 4 ways that you can buy real estate with no money and no credit. But, this isn\u2019t something easy\u2026there\u2019s a reason why you don\u2019t see people doing this all the time. It\u2019s a LOT of work to find a good property in and of itself\u2026combine that with finding a seller who\u2019s amenable to the terms, combine that with them generally owning it outright and not needing to sell immediately, and finding a seller who will sell at the price you want to pay. It\u2019s all doable, but by no means do I necessarily think it\u2019s a good idea to chase after. Personally, I think your time and resources are best spent earning money, saving, living below your means, and waiting it out for the right property to come up - it\u2019ll give you more options at your disposal. But for those who were curious and wanted to know\u2026now you know. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-07-27T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to buy real estate no money down","no money down real estate","how to buy real estate with no money","how to buy real estate with no money down","how to buy real estate without cash or credit","how to buy real estate cheap","how to wholesale","seller financing","seller financing real estate","lease option real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 2018","passive income","how to buy real estate","real estate investor","grant cardone"],"title":"The Truth: How To Buy Real Estate With No Money and No Credit","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JMesQqmoMoY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JMesQqmoMoY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JMesQqmoMoY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JMesQqmoMoY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JMesQqmoMoY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"366","dislikeCount":"129","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5297","viewCount":"154697"}},{"id":"UmL4wAcBHkE","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about how to make passive income, and debunk some common misconceptions out there\u2026more information in the description. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF + FREE Coaching Cal FOR A LIMITED TIMEl: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\n\nThe first myth is that you need money to make passive income.\nWhen it comes to making passive income, there are two strategies behind it:\nThe first option is to BUY your passive income\nThe second option is to spend your TIME creating passive income\nIf you want to buy your passive income, consider that every $100 you invest buys you anywhere from $3-$7 of passive income annually. But what most people HERE are interested in is spending their TIME, not MONEY, creating passive income. This could be creating and selling a digital product, drop shipping, amazon FBA, affiliate marketing, making YouTube videos, renting out parts of your house that you don\u2019t use, the list goes on. If you don\u2019t have money to invest, THIS is the best way to start. But keep in mind, when making passive income, you are paid in DIRECT relation to the value you provide - you cannot just get something for nothing.\n\nThe second myth is that passive income lasts forever: you set it up once, and you\u2019re good for life. \nI\u2019d like to say that in 95% of situations, this is not the case - it will not last forever, at least not without a fairly sizable amount of risk that it disappears. From the way I see it, most passive income streams will be set up to run for a few months to maybe a decade - and then they need to be re adjusted and modified, or maybe they simply become obsolete and they don\u2019t work anymore. \n\nThe third myth is that passive income is doing nothing. \nAnd this is true. Kidding. People often see how much I make from real estate and YouTube and expect it\u2019s all easy money where I just sit around all day\u2026and sometimes yeah, I sit around all day, but it does require SOME work. For my rental properties, this is usually about 1-2 hours of work per month\u2026this is making sure all bills are paid, rent checks are tracked, and expenses are calculated. So whatever income stream you take on, chances are it will require SOME level of work\u2026even though it might not be much, in 99% of situations, it will be something. Some more than others, but regardless, by leveraging your time, you\u2019ll likely make WAY more per hour of your time than you could in any other business. \n\nThe fourth myth is that you need to be an expert on something to make passive income. \nThis is absolutely not the case. For instance, when I started buying real estate\u2026I was NOT an expert. I made many mistakes and learned as I went along, figuring out each step as I needed it. When making YouTube videos, I had no idea what I was doing\u2026I watched other YouTube videos each time I was confused, figured it out, and then moved on. My point being, if you have a goal in mind, it\u2019s not important if you\u2019re not an expert if you have the self motivation to figure it out as you go along. \n\nThe fifth, and final myth is that passive income is easy.\nAnd to be honest, it can be easy\u2026once it\u2019s already set up. But setting it up is hard and time consuming, otherwise everyone would be doing it. Earning passive income, in most cases, is really just like delayed compensation\u2026you put in a lot of time and effort now with no pay, under the expectation that you\u2019ll get paid all of it back plus interest in the future. Most people will not have the discipline to do this, most people want the immediate results and get frustrated when its been a week and they haven\u2019t earned any money yet. Then they complain, they quit, and then try something else with similar results. And the same thing happens. But if you have the persistence to make it work, I have no doubt you\u2019ll make it work\u2026just do me a favor and have quality. There is always a market for quality, no matter what it is. Quality gets people coming back, quality makes you stand out, and quality gets happy repeat customers. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-07-25T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to make passive income","how to make passive income online","how to make passive income with no investment","how to make passive income with no money","how to make passive income with real estate","how to make passive income on youtube","passive income ideas","passive income online","passive income ideas 2018","passive income streams","passive income 2018","how to be a millionaire","how to make passive income as a teenager","passive income 101","investing for beginners"],"title":"How to make Passive Income 101: Expectations vs Reality","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UmL4wAcBHkE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UmL4wAcBHkE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UmL4wAcBHkE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UmL4wAcBHkE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UmL4wAcBHkE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M1S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"937","dislikeCount":"111","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6792","viewCount":"105912"}},{"id":"VXeaU0i54H0","snippet":{"description":"Here's a Real Estate beginner tutorial where I can really cover the blueprints and outline the basics of what\u2019s needed in order to prepare for, and actually invest in real estate. Enjoy!

This is one of those steps that you can can do NOW. If you\u2019re watching this and you don\u2019t already have a credit card, when you\u2019re done with this video, watch this:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ukaWAjgkH9M&t=30s\n\nStep 2: SAVE YOUR MONEY. The reality is that you can\u2019t invest in real estate with no money down, no income, no credit\u2026it just doesn\u2019t happen. So this means that in order to save money, not only will you be required to live somewhat frugally so you don\u2019t spend everything you make, but you will need to MAKE MONEY. I know this sounds common sense, but it\u2019s at least every day that I get people asking how they can buy real estate without having any money\u2026it doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nStep 3: SHOW YOUR INCOME on a tax return. his means that you can\u2019t just have one great month on Shopify and then expect to use that as a down payment\u2026lenders want to see consistent, stable income before they give you a loan. \n\nStep 4: Get prequalified. It\u2019s as easy as going to a few major banks, having them run your credit, giving them your tax returns, bank statements, and some other minor information\u2026and they will give you a pre-approval amount based off those numbers. You can then take that pre-approval and shop that around a few other banks, getting them to match or beat those terms. \n\nStep 5: LOOK AT EVERYTHING IN THE MARKET YOU WANT TO BUY IN. Do your research. Find out which areas you feel are undervalued and where you feel people will be moving to. Drive around on weekends through every street and neighborhood. See every open house on a Saturday and Sunday within your price range, plus maybe a few hundred grand so you know what\u2019s out there. The more you see, the better you\u2019ll be able to recognize a good deal when it comes up. \n\nStep 6: Make offers on places you feel are a good deal. Know your price, know what it\u2019s worth, and have patience. It\u2019s more important to get the right property at a fair price than wait years trying to find the unicorn of a deal. \n\nStep 7: Do your inspections. I usually tell my clients to do all the inspections they can, and usually it\u2019ll be a break even when you re-negotiate a credit with the seller. I also take it a step further and also walk two contractors through the unit who will give me a free bid on how much things cost to repair. This way, I know everything that\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d from a cosmetic standpoint and exactly how much it\u2019ll cost to fix. \n\nStep 8: Close on the property. In the interim here, you\u2019ll be speaking with your lender, getting in all the information they request from you, do an appraisal on the property to make sure it\u2019s worth what you\u2019re paying, and you close. Once the property is yours, this is where the fun begins!\n\nStep 9: Do minor renovations. Most people ask \u201cwhere do you find your contractors?!\u201d And my answer to this has always been Word of mouth, and yelp. Also make sure to get various bids to understand the costs associated with what you want to do, never just hire the first person. \n\nStep 10: Rent it out.

It\u2019s no surprise, obviously, that Kylie came from an extremely affluent family. The popularity of their Reality TV show, combined with the emergence of social media, proved to be a winning combination\u2026Kylie is now one of the most followed people on Instagram at 111 MILLION followers\u2026but it\u2019s how she was able to leverage that that really gets interesting, and that\u2019s what I want to focus this video around. \n\nIn 2014, she took $250,000 of that and began producing her own lip kits. She leveraged her social media following for a few months, hyping up her lip kits\u2026and when she launched, she sold out of her 15,000 kits. Within one minute. At that point, she expanded with Shopify. In early 2016, she rebranded as \u201cKylie Cosmetics\u201d\u2026and that\u2019s where the fun began. She\u2019d hype up her products on social media, and day of launch - she\u2019d sell out\u2026to the tune of 19 MILLION DOLLARS. In just 24 hours. And the best part\u2026.it was all digital.. A partnership with SeedBeauty outsources EVERYTHING. \n\nBut, here\u2019s the billion-dollar-question\u2026does this actually make her \u201cSelf Made?\u201d Honestly, \u201cself made\u201d is just such a loose term\u2026Each of us has a different definition of \u201cSelf Made,\u201d and the reality is that we will each be born with some types of advantages in life. I think it\u2019s important to realize that all of us right now are born with an advantage that many don\u2019t have\u2026if you have the luxury to sit here and spend your time on the internet watching a video on YouTube, chances you\u2019re already in a pretty good position in life, all things considered. But what does this mean for Kylie? When she invested $250,000 into her lip care company, she could afford to take risk and chose more aggressive business moves, knowing that if it failed, it\u2019s no big deal - unlike many people who would\u2019ve played it more safe and taken less risk.\n\nIf I were to take a position here\u2026and people might disagree with me here\u2026is yes, I do believe she\u2019s self made. While she certainly started out much further than most, turning what was probably $5 million dollars of her own wealth built through the TV show into a $900,000,000 fortune is nonetheless absolutely impressive, especially by the age of 20 years old. While her family did provide her with the start of that audience, it\u2019s what she DID with it that\u2019s impressive. \n\nThe bigger picture of this\u2026is to realize that ALL OF US have some type of advantage that works in our favor that other people don\u2019t have. Be grateful for what you have, and realize that just being alive and healthy is an advantage. It\u2019s how you decide to USE that to your advantage that really matters the most\u2026are you going to complain that someone out there has more than you and that\u2019s not fair or that they didn\u2019t deserve it?

Enjoy! Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nSo first, lets talk about who\u2019s BEHIND these signs and what actually happens when you call. You have two types of people who post these signs, the first is generally the wholesaler, and the second is the one who teaches you how to wholesale. So lets start with the first one: the wholesaler. \n\nA wholesaler is someone who finds a distressed property, gets it under contract under market value, and then assigns that contract to an investor for an even higher price. The wholesaler then profits the difference in price between what they have the house in contract for, and what their investor is willing to pay. \n\nBut the most difficult part when wholesaling is finding distressed sellers. And as a wholesaler, generally your time is not best spent finding these deals\u2026it\u2019s best spent NEGOTIATING these deals, and then pitching these deals to investors. That\u2019s where the sign comes into play. So the wholesaler will them teach you how to find deals\u2026this is usually a time-consuming process that involves calling numbers from the public record that are behind on their payments, calling absentee owners, door knocking distressed sellers, or what\u2019s called \u201cdriving for dollars\u201d - which is basically where you drive around a neighborhood, find a home that looks poorly taken care of, and then door knock it to see if they\u2019re willing to sell. This term is also known as \u201cBird Dogging.\u201d \n\nYou as the \u201cTrainee\u201d will get paid for leads you bring in to the wholesaler. Hypothetically, if you product results and bring in motivated seller leads - Yes, you can make some pretty decent money. So in that sense, it CAN be a legitimate business. But this benefits the wholesaler more than anyone else - the wholesaler gets free work, only pays if THEY make money, and with this there\u2019s very little risk to the wholesaler besides their time training someone what to do. \n\nThe second type behind this sign is the person will explain that they\u2019re holding a \u201cfree seminar\u201d on how to get started making money in real estate. They usually then upset you on programs that you have to pay into to learn the business of wholesaling. These types of companies might also have a second spin on things, as well. You can join their inner program, for a price, and then get a commission for anyone else who buys their educational material.  \n\nSo either way you look at it, you\u2019re usually getting the short end of the stick anytime you call these signs\u2026just don\u2019t do it. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-07-13T22:30:02Z","tags":["real estate investor seeks trainee","real estate bandit signs","real estate investor seeks trainee signs","real estate investor seeks trainee scam","real estate signs","bandit signs for wholesaling","bandit signs marketing","bandit signs real estate","bandit signs 101","bandit signs 2018","how to wholesale real estate","how to wholesale real estate step by step","how to wholesale houses","how to wholesale 2018","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","biggerpockets"],"title":"Those \u201cReal Estate Investor Seeks Trainee\u201d Signs: Make $120k\/yr With No Experience?!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rtlzhhqQeGc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rtlzhhqQeGc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rtlzhhqQeGc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rtlzhhqQeGc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rtlzhhqQeGc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M15S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1431","dislikeCount":"360","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13121","viewCount":"105653"}},{"id":"gyJga_kAt_U","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s how you can drive an exotic car for \u201cfree\u201d by timing it right and without losing money on depreciation, and potentially even selling it later for a profit - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nI\u2019ve been fortunate enough that I\u2019ve been able to drive my last two sports cars for \u201cfree,\u201d while losing absolutely ZERO money on them. In fact, my Lotus Exige S240 has been CHEAPER to own than my last Toyota Prius and I\u2019ve actually MADE money on this car since I bought it\u2026and some cars even appreciate in value higher than the stock market\u2026so let me explain. \n\nHere\u2019s how the concept works. Most mass produced cars will depreciate about half of their value over the first 4 years\u2026after that, depreciation slows down to maybe about 5-10% annually depending on the car and mileage. After about 10-12 years, the car has lost the majority of its value and it just continues to slowly drop in value, although the depreciation isn\u2019t so intense after 10 years or so - but the value continues going down. \n\nExotic cars work a little different - they\u2019ll see most of their depreciation within the first 5 years, and then they\u2019ll continue slowly dropping in price for a few years after that depending on mileage. But then they\u2019ll reach a bottom\u2026where they just tend to stay. Exotic Cars all seem to have this base level value where they\u2019re always going to be worth a certain amount.nAnd with interest rates relatively low on cars like this for 3-5 year periods, as long as you have the income and credit history to qualify for a loan - you can often just buy the car, invest your money elsewhere at a higher return, and drive the car without losing any money on depreciation. \n\nSure, you WILL be tying up money in the car - and you will have to pay insurance, taxes, gas, etc like you would on any car - but when done right, the car is basically just a savings account you can drive. And in some situation, your savings account actually makes money.\n\nIt\u2019s quite easy to spot these price trends, as well. A few weeks of searching and going on car forums will give you a solid foundation of knowledge to see which cars tend to hold their values better than others. Some examples of potential cars to drive:\n$12,000-$30,000: Honda S2000\n$27,000 - $65,000: Lotus Elise and Lotus Exige\n$30,000-$70,000: Original Acura NSX\n$50,000-$70,000: 1997 or 1997 Viper GTS\n$60,000-$90,000: First Generation Aston Martin Vanquish\n$60,000-$200,000: Air Cooled Porsche 911 993\n$100,000-$120,000: Lamborghini Gallardo \n$135,000-$180,000: Lamborghini Murcielago\n$150,000-$200,000: Manual Ferrari F430\n$170,000-$290,000: BMW Z8\n$200,000-$300,000: Lamborghini Diablo \n$250,000-$500,000: Ford GT\n\nIn addition, I\u2019d also say the Porsche Carerra GT is a good one, the Porsche 918\u2026any Ferrari F40, F50, Enzo..the original Mercedes 300SL, I\u2019m sure there are plenty more\u2026but let me know your thoughts in the comment section. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-07-11T23:11:01Z","tags":["How to drive an exotic car for free","how to drive an exotic car","how to buy an exotic car","how to buy an exotic car cheap","how to buy a lamborghini","how to buy a ferrari","how to buy a lamborghini huracan","how to buy a ferrari 458","lotus elise","lotus exige","how to buy a lamborghini for free","ferrari 430","mercedes 300sl","how to buy a ferrari cheap","how to finance exotic cars","how to finance expensive car","lamborghini murcielago","audi r8","real estate","real estate agent"],"title":"How to drive an Exotic Car for Free (Top 10 Best Cars)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gyJga_kAt_U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gyJga_kAt_U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gyJga_kAt_U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gyJga_kAt_U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gyJga_kAt_U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1621","dislikeCount":"305","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12785","viewCount":"315390"}},{"id":"6qRkwqXz3P8","snippet":{"description":"There was a time, a long long time ago, in a neighborhood far, far away\u2026that I actually did door knocking as a real estate agent.

Well wonder no longer, this is what they are and why people post them - enjoy! Add me on Instagram \/ Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nSo lets start here: the purpose of these signs is to attract people who NEED to sell, and NEED to sell fast - often in less desirable, or up-and-coming areas, and often at a discount to market value. These signs are also called Bandit Signs. These areas are more likely to find distressed sellers who don\u02bct have the luxury of waiting around for an offer, can\u02bct come up with cash to perform any repairs, or might only be weeks away from losing the property to the bank - and they NEED to sell ASAP and take a loss from what they could otherwise get in any other scenario. The purpose of the signs is to attract sellers who are desperate to sell, and don\u2019t mind taking a discount to sell quickly. \n\nBut who\u02bcs on the other side of the deal, who\u02bcs the one actually buying these properties? These are the three types of people:\n\nFirst, the wholesaler. They will evaluate the property and negotiate a price to buy the home, usually with an assignment clause, allowing them to transfer the deal - and the price - to someone else, for a higher price than they\u2019re in contract for. This gives them the OPTION to buy that home at the pre agreed upon price, and then they can ASSIGN that deal to someone else for a profit. \n\nThe second type of person buying these properties are simply individual investors. These are people, like me, who\u02bcd like to cut out the middle man and cut out the competition. They place these signs to buy properties directly from the home owner, saving them time, commission, and hassle of selling and listing the property. The homeowner will sell the property less because they have the convenience of not dealing with a formally-listed sale, they don\u02bct have to pay 5%-6% fees to a Realtor, and the investor can save on all of those costs by making the sale as timely and efficient as possible. \n\nAnd the third type of person posting those \u201cWe buy houses\u201d signs are larger companies who typically give a quick close, cash offer - these are the most efficient of the ads. They can typically give a hard offer within 24-48 hours and close within a week or two. In exchange for this, they\u02bcll typically want a discount of 10-40% from market price.

I have no idea if stock market prices will be lower next week, higher next week, or lower next year, or higher next year\u2026no one knows for sure. \n\nWith that said, here\u2019s an interesting perspective\u2026In May of 2013, stocks hit all time highs\u2026at this point, the SP500 was sitting around $1630 per share. \nThen we have April 1st, 2014\u2026stocks hit more all time highs. At this point, the SP500 was hovering around $1860 per share. \nThen we have April 23rd, 2015\u2026stocks hit all time highs, and the SP500 was now at $2080 per share.\nThen we have August 8th, 2016\u2026now the SP500 was trading at $2180 per share.\nAnd then August 1 2017\u2026.STOCKS HIT RECORD HIGHS\u2026 the SP500 was trading at $2400 per share.\nAnd now\u2026AUGUST 29TH\u2026STOCKS HIT RECORD HIGHS\u2026and the SP500 is at $2900 per share. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. Naturally we\u2019re always going to be hitting record highs at some point or another. They have been in the 1950\u2019s, the 1960\u2019s, the 70\u2019s\u2026all the way to today. As markets increase, this is just a natural part of investing that we all thankfully have to deal with. The reality is\u2026do we know when the market will drop? No. Could it be lower a year from now? Yes. Could it decline in price for the next several years in a row? Yes. Can we accurately and consistently predict when it will crash and when it will rise? Not really..\n\nGiven this context, we can only base an investing strategy off what we KNOW, which comes from long term historic trends. The safest, and also the most profitable investing strategy EVER when it comes to investing, is this:\nSave Your Money\nBuy when you can\nBuy consistently\nDon\u2019t worry about \u201cbuying low, selling high\u201d\nSimply buy and DON\u2019T SELL. \n\nThat\u2019s it. Will there be some years the market goes down? Absolutely. Will there be years the market goes up? YES. Could it go down tomorrow? Yes. Could it go up tomorrow? Yes. But the long term trend should be overall UP when you look at a 20-30 year timespan. Invest what you can, live below your means, save money\u2026and hold long term. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-30T22:30:00Z","tags":["stock market","stock market prediction 2018","stock market for beginners","stock market news","stock market for dummies","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","stock market explained","stock market 101","how to trade stocks","how to trade stocks online for beginners","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing explained","real estate investing 101","stock market news today","stock market prices","passive income","passive income explained"],"title":"STOCK MARKET HITS ALL TIME HIGHS - TIME TO SELL!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxajV5JuHXY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxajV5JuHXY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxajV5JuHXY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxajV5JuHXY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxajV5JuHXY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M6S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"669","dislikeCount":"85","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1655","viewCount":"33160"}},{"id":"fMWkgA6671I","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about probably one of the most in-demand, most asked for, and biggest topics on the history of the internet and YouTube\u2026and that is making Passive Income.

Passive income is NOT EVER FREE. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to be BUYING your way to passive income, it\u2019s very simple: Generally you can see anywhere from a 3%-10% return on your money annually with some decent consistency, predictability, and reliability, without going too risky to a point where your income could dry up any month. This means that for every $10,000 you invest, you should be able \u201cbuy\u201d yourself $300-$1000 per YEAR in passive income. \n\nWhen buying your way to passive income, your return is DIRECTLY correlated with the amount of risk you take, and how much time you have to spend setting it up. Arguably real estate takes some time to set up, and even with a property manager, it\u2019s never truly 100% passive\u2026it might be more like 98% passive. With an index fund, a 3% withdrawal is virtually risk free, guaranteed, and requires you to do NOTHING - and your return is directly correlated to that, by the fact that you make LESS.\n\nHowever, your TIME is generally, by far, the most lucrative way of creating and sustaining passive income. Namely because you can do the work upfront, let it run, and oftentimes the types of passive income businesses reliant on your TIME are often the same businesses that are easily scalable, meaning you have nearly unlimited potential in how much money you decide to make. Now while spending your time creating passive income is often labor intensive and could take weeks or months to even see a return on your time, once it\u2019s up and running, this could last you a very, very long time. \n\nIt\u2019s very important to realize that, when you\u2019re spending your time creating passive income, you are paid in direct proportion to amount of value you provide. If you\u2019re not providing value in a way where people will SEE IT, you won\u2019t make money. Using your time to create passive income is just as much providing value as it is marketing yourself to those who you will offer a service for\u2026it\u2019s that simple. \n\nThe most difficult part when spending your time to create passive income is just making those first few dollars. Until you\u2019ve seen SOMETHING back in return, it\u2019s really, really easy to get discouraged. But once you see even fifty cents coming in, or a dollar, or a few dollars\u2026that stuff gets you so excited that you created something from nothing\u2026that it was entirely your own effort that lead you to making a little extra money. From there, it\u2019s about growing it and scaling upwards. It\u2019s about expanding on what works, cutting what doesn\u2019t, and improving those income streams. \n\nIdeally, in a perfect world, you\u2019d have a combination of both types of passive income - by investing your money, AND by investing your time. This gives you the ultimate exposure to different markets where one is independent of the other, and when you make money from the TIME aspect, just move it over to the MONEY aspect and continue to grow that, as well. \n\nEven though this video is less about giving you specific ideas - because lets face it, there a million ideas out there and you can get that with a quick google search - I really hope this can help lay the framework for you to build on, and eventually create your own passive income mini empire from. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-29T22:30:00Z","tags":["passive income","passive income ideas","passive income online","passive income investments","passive income ideas 2018","passive income real estate","passive income explained","passive income 101","how to make passive income","passive income gurus","passive income streams","how to make money on youtube","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","passive income for beginners","real estate investing strategies","real estate 101","passive income youtube","how to invest"],"title":"The ULTIMATE Beginners Guide to making Passive Income Step-By Step","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fMWkgA6671I\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fMWkgA6671I\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fMWkgA6671I\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fMWkgA6671I\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fMWkgA6671I\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M53S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"502","dislikeCount":"54","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2853","viewCount":"55453"}},{"id":"HWn4ribPjgE","snippet":{"description":"It\u2019s no surprise that there\u2019s a lot of discussion lately about the real estate market potentially dropping.

And I don\u2019t disagree, this is a fair argument. But this ignores some other important aspects. \n\nFor me, I don\u2019t flip properties. In fact, I never intend on ever selling them - I keep them on low-interest, fixed rate mortgages for 30 years and I rent them out. Rent covers all my expenses and spits out some extra profit each month. I don\u2019t plan on selling, so the properties value doesn\u2019t really make a big difference. Instead, I care what the home is worth 30 years from now. \n\nHere\u2019s what happens, and it\u2019s happening RIGHT NOW. People are reading about the real estate market softening and because of that, they don\u2019t want to buy now - instead, they want to wait for prices to drop even further, then buy in at the bottom. All those people who are sitting on the sidelines are doing what\u2026they\u2019re RENTING. All those people out priced from the market? They\u2019re RENTING. Those sellers which sell their rental properties? That\u2019s one less property on the market to rent. \n\nThe one thing that does historically well in a real estate drop is\u2026rentals. Rentals are making the money. So either way, from the way I see it, I win. I\u2019m either getting a really strong rental market, which means more money in my pocket, or rising values\u2026which means money in my pocket. So why would I care if my place is worth 5% less next year if that just means there are more tenants looking for rentals, which helps drive that market higher? \n\nIn the bigger scope of things, unless you\u2019re flipping real estate\u2026.which I personally don\u2019t recommend, and I have a video about why I don\u2019t flip real estate\u2026timing the market is a gamble. You might get it right sometimes, you might get it wrong sometimes. I\u2019ve seen more people get it wrong than get it right, however.  If you can\u2019t find a good deal, don\u2019t buy\u2026trust me, you can over pay for a property in a really bad market, and you can under pay for a property in a great market. Your individual skillset will prove much more profitable than the market dictates. \n\nInvest what you can afford, live below your means, buy properties that cash flow, buy them on a fixed rate long term loan so there are no surprises about your payments fluctuating, and wait. If you find a deal, go for it\u2026if you don\u2019t, then wait. Simple as that. No sense over complicating anything. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-27T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing 2018","real estate investing 101","real estate agent","real estate investing with no money","real estate coach","real estate mentor","investing 101","how to invest","brrrr method","rental property","grant cardone","real estate economy","real estate 2019","passive income","passive income ideas"],"title":"The Truth about the Real Estate Market Crashing...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HWn4ribPjgE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HWn4ribPjgE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HWn4ribPjgE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HWn4ribPjgE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HWn4ribPjgE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"474","dislikeCount":"69","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1406","viewCount":"34109"}},{"id":"7syDSQE9Rfo","snippet":{"description":"Let\u2019s get the top people together in Amazon FBA, Affiliate Marketing, Social Media Marketing, and Real Estate, to discuss which industry we believe is the BEST, and why\u2026enjoy!

The advantage to the seller is that you can sell your property with the tenant already living in the house, thereby not losing out on any rental income during the selling process.\n\nFrom the BUYER perspective of things, I have to say, I really, really, like the layout a lot. The ability to go online and play with the numbers and instantly see how they affect your cash flow is awesome. Roofstock also has a \u201c30-day money back guarantee,\u201d where Roofstock will buy back the property if you\u2019re unsatisfied with the purchase.\n\nEven though the process seems very streamlined, one of the biggest flaws I see if that it doesn\u2019t appear like you can do your own inspections on the property. They have their own certification process and they will provide you with their own inspection reports and due diligence for you to review. \n\nMy second concern is that these properties don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re really in prime locations. Now prime location is certainly subjective depending on who\u2019s looking at it, but from the way I see it, these are mainly cash flowing properties. \n\nThe third downside I see with this is that there\u2019s not really any room for improvement. I understand that this isn\u2019t Roofstock\u2019s target audience, and they\u2019re going after the laid back investor who just buys and sits back\u2026nothing wrong with that\u2026but a buyer could get MUCH more value by buying a property, remodeling it, and renting it out themselves for a higher price than buying something turn key. \n\nSome seller issues I could see:\n\nNot having a sign out front of your house. Having a sign out front makes people aware that there\u2019s a home being sold. The more exposure a home gets, the better. \n\nSecond downside\u2026the property isn\u2019t listed on the MLS. Again, exposure gets homes to sell at higher prices. And by not listing on the MLS, they\u2019re excluding a LOT of buyers from even seeing that home to begin with. \n\nThird downside, because you\u2019re selling the home occupied with a tenant, your buyer pool is very, very small. You\u2019re immediately excluding all the families that might want to buy that home just to live in, themselves.\n\nSo given that, honestly, I don\u2019t really see it being a bad service. I\u2019m pretty neutral about it. For buyers, it would be nice to do your own inspections and due diligence\u2026and also to get the best bang for the buck, it\u2019s definitely worth it to do the work yourself\u2026but I get that not everyone has the time or interest in doing that, and if they\u2019re okay paying a premium for turnkey properties, nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m not a fan of the areas they have listed, they all seem too remote for me\u2026which carries its own risk in desirability and the ability to re-rent the home, but that\u2019s all subjective. It\u2019s really, really important for a buyer to do their research into how easy the home will be to re-rent during a vacancy, and how well the areas are poised to grow\u2026if any. \n\nFor sellers, I suppose if you want an easy, hassle free, streamlined process for sale\u2026it seems decent. But, I also believe that you\u2019re leaving money on the table by ONLY appealing to investors, NOT listing on the MLS, and NOT allowing for private showings. But like I said\u2026overall, it seems decent. I like their guarantee. I like their calculators. Would I personally use it? I really doubt it. Do I think it\u2019s a decent place to start? It can be.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-22T22:30:00Z","tags":["roofstock","roofstock review","roofstock real estate","roofstock vs fundrise","roofstock review 2018","roofstock vs morris invest","roofstock bigger pockets","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2018","real estate investing for beginners","real estate step by step","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","passive income","turnkey real estate","turnkey real estate investing","turnkey real estate review"],"title":"Exposed: RoofStock\u2019s TurnKey Real Estate Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bi6xf-YvbYc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bi6xf-YvbYc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bi6xf-YvbYc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bi6xf-YvbYc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Bi6xf-YvbYc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M30S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"375","dislikeCount":"47","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5125","viewCount":"53872"}},{"id":"VS00yYyx9Ho","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered how so many people seem to avoid paying taxes\u2026legally, of course, when investing in real estate? Want to know how YOU can avoid paying taxes, legally? Here\u2019s how - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF + FREE Coaching Call FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nNumber 1: The first is that pretty much anything in real estate that relates to your business is a write off against your income. Just about anything you related to the income you make on a rental property is a BUSINESS expense, and that\u2019s subtracted from your total income - and you pay less taxes. \n\nNumber 2: Depreciation. This is probably THE best write off in real estate. This is often how people can make thousands of dollars in profit every month, but on PAPER, they\u2019re claiming they LOST money. In some circumstances you can even use this loss to offset other income you made!\n\nNumber 3: This is probably the most well known, and probably one of the coolest write offs in real estate\u2026 but for those who aren\u2019t familiar with it, this is the 1031 Exchange. One of the benefits of investing in real estate is that you can INDEFINITELY defer paying taxes when you sell a property, and \u201cexchange\u201d it for another property to avoid paying tax on your profit.\n\nNumber Four: This would apply to most of you watching, especially if you own your own home, is the capital Gains exclusion. This capital gains exclusion means that you can make $250,000 TAX FREE PROFIT if you\u2019re single, and $500,000 TAX FREE PROFIT if you\u2019re married when you own a primary residence and have lived there for 2 of the last 5 years. \n\nNumber 5: There\u2019s no tax on appreciation until you sell. This is similar to owning a stock that goes up in value, you don\u2019t pay taxes on that stock until you actually sell\u2026until then, any profit you\u2019ve made is called an \u201cunrealized gain.\u201d Same thing in real estate. If the property goes up in value 5% annually, your net worth goes up without you owning a dime in taxes. \n\nNumber 6: The cash-out refinance and HELOC, which stands for Home Equity Line Of Credit. The benefit of this is that you get access to your money, totally tax free, without technically \u201cmaking\u201d money. In the eyes of the IRS, you don\u2019t pay tax until you actually sell\u2026and because you don\u2019t sell, you don\u2019t owe any tax. Same principle applies to a HELOC. All of the money you pull out is tax-free since technically it\u2019s a loan and you need to pay it back.\n\nNumber 7: Rental income doesn\u2019t pay self employment taxes, which consists of social security and medicare taxes. This means that rental income, right off the top, is taxed 6.2% LESS than that same income you\u2019d make from you job - or 15.3% less if you\u2019re self employed, not even including all the deductions, tax write offs, depreciation\u2026so you can see, real estate is a good way to make some money ;) \n\nNumber 8: Mortgage interest deduction. Now this is a great one that not only applies to rental properties, where you simply just use that as an expense against rental income, but this also applies to your personal residence. The IRS says that you can deduct the interest you pay on up to $750,000 of your mortgage against your earned income, lowering the amount of taxes you\u2019d owe. \n\nFinally\u2026number 9\u2026the holy grail for real estate people\u2026is the title called \u201cReal Estate Professional.\u201d Becoming a \u201creal estate professional\u201d opens up a lot of advantages. The biggest advantage of being a real estate professional is that you can use your PAPER LOSSES to OFFSET other earned income! \n\nRemember: this is not financial advice, and CONSULT A CPA for any of your specific tax questions.

I finally hired a property manager while I invest in real estate, after 7 years of managing the my rentals myself. Here\u2019s why and what led me to that choice - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF + FREE Coaching Call FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nI ended up buying two houses and a triplex in late 2011 and early 2012. Since then, managing them has been extremely easy. For the most part, it took me 1-2 hours per MONTH of work to manage 5 tenants at the time. Most of this time was spent making sure rent had been paid, cashing rent checks, making sure bills were paid, and just generic accounting. If something broke, I\u2019d just call a contractor to go out and fix it. I also rarely had vacancies..\n\nMy rental landlord philosophy was this\u2026 I generally don\u2019t raise rent, unless it\u2019s a unique situation or cash flow issue. For instance, on my original 3 properties, I\u2019ve only raised rents when a unit becomes vacant. I\u2019ve had some tenants since 2011 that are paying the SAME rent since back then. Am I leaving money on the table? Sure. But on the upside, I have really, really great tenants that take really good care of the place, treat it like their own, always pay on time, and are all around really awesome people, making it easy for me to manage. They have zero desire to move since they\u2019re paying so much less than they would if they went somewhere else and in return, it\u2019s easy for me. It\u2019s a win win. \n\nBut recently the unthinkable happened\u2026a tenant had to move and relocate for work. And now my vacant place needed a little work - just minor fixes, re painting some stuff, etc. And finally, at that point, I thought about it\u2026the time it would take for me to drive an hour each way just to go there, the time it would take to coordinate a walk through, meet and screen tenants, handle payment, etc\u2026just wasn\u2019t worth it. My time was better spent doing just about anything else. And finally, it clicked\u2026I gotta hire a property manager, I just can\u2019t handle it myself. \n\nSo I did some research online, found a recommendation\u2026did some negotiating back and forth for a day on prices between that and another company, and settled on a flat 8% management fee, everything included, and I moved forward. My reasoning now is that my time is way more valuable doing anything else other than managing a place, and the money I spend will save me more money that I can make elsewhere. \n\nSo I did it\u2026I hired a property manager for my first house. Now remember, I\u2019m still managing my other 4\u2026that\u2019s really easy. But if I have another vacancy, the management company will get that one too. And eventually I\u2019ll slowly phase the management company in to replace all the work I currently did. \n\nI\u2019m only a month into this so far, but overall I like it. It\u2019s amazing to be \u201cStress free\u201d and have that distance between you and the tenant. I like that someone else handles it all, and all I have to do is simply just collect the check\u2026I\u2019m a little paranoid that something might fall through the cracks if I\u2019m not micro managing it, but I\u2019m doing my best just to let someone else take over.\n\nSo that\u2019s the story, and that\u2019s why I hired a manager for one of my properties. If this goes well, I\u2019ll slowly phase it in to everything else and have real estate investing become 1-2 hours per month more passive. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-15T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2018","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate for beginners","real estate 101","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 2018","real estate investing with no money","biggerpockets","landlording 101","how to be a landlord","tenant screening","property management","property manager day in the life","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor"],"title":"Couldn\u2019t handle it...why I just hired a property manager","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N-Is3-14HAA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N-Is3-14HAA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N-Is3-14HAA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N-Is3-14HAA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N-Is3-14HAA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1516","dislikeCount":"363","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19606","viewCount":"470358"}},{"id":"naf_HjApLmI","snippet":{"description":"What\u2019s worth more: The $100 you save, or the $100 you earned? What would YOU rather have the option to do? Here\u2019s what\u2019s better, enjoy!

If there\u2019s something you want, instead of scaling back and saving your existing income, just work more and make an extra $100\u2026seems simple\u2026but in reality, that $100 isn\u2019t what you think. Let\u2019s start here\u2026to earn that extra $100, chances are, you\u2019re going to have to spend your time making that extra $100. In this example, we\u2019re going to take the typical single California resident earning about $55,000 per year, or $27 per hour. \n\nThis means that to make an extra $100 in income, it requires you to work 3 hours and 42 minutes. But wait a second\u2026 unfortunately, you also have taxes. Since we\u2019re focusing on the top end of your $55,000 per year income bracket, 22% is subtracted from federal income tax\u2026.9.3% from state income tax\u20266.2% for social security tax\u2026and another 1.45% in medicare taxes. If you\u2019re self employed, you tack on another 7% and then cry yourself to sleep\u2026\n\nThat means for the typical employee, $100 earned is only $61.00 after taxes\u2026and just like that, you lost 39% of your income. If you\u2019re self employed, the number is closer to HALF\u2026you lose almost 50% of your income to taxes. \n\nThis means, in order to MAKE an extra $100 AFTER taxes, it requires you to EARN $165, WHICH AT $27 an hour, equates to just over 6 HOURS of work. Now, compare that to the $100 you already have in your bank account. Most likely, that $100 you have is already after tax money. That $100 is equal to $100. \n\nNot only that, but when you compare the two\u2026do you think it\u2019s EASIER working over 6 hours to make $100 after taxes at $27 an hour\u2026or is it easier to just find a way to not spend the existing $100 you already have? Chances are, you can find a LOT of ways to save $100 that won\u2019t take you over 6 hours to do.\n\nThis means that the time it takes to SAVE $100 is drastically less than the time it takes to MAKE $100 after taxes. And from an ROI perspective, spending your time focusing SAVING MORE will have a much greater outcome than focusing your time on EARNING MORE. And doing this is much better at increasing your net worth. \n\nWhat intensifies this even MORE is that anything you spend $100 on is paid for with after tax money\u2026meaning that the $100 item you bought, is really worth $165 worth of gross income. \n\nThe main purpose and takeaway of this video is really just to show you the power of FIRST focusing on reducing your expenses and saving money, because THIS often has the best ROI, THEN focusing on making more money SECOND. Not only does SAVING the $100 require less time and less work, but it\u2019s WAY easier than earning an extra $100 after taxes. So you need to think to yourself\u2026would you rather spend $100 less, or spend your time earning $165 more? And when you look at it this way, it\u2019s really like every $100 you save is worth $165 earned. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-13T22:30:00Z","tags":["personal finance","how to invest","personal finance 101","personal finance for dummies","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to save money","how to save money with low income","how to save money for a house","how to invest money","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to become a millionaire","how to become a millionaire in 3 years","dave ramsey","passive income strategies","passive income ideas","passive income 2018","money tips"],"title":"What\u2019s Worth More: $100 SAVED or $200 EARNED?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naf_HjApLmI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naf_HjApLmI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naf_HjApLmI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naf_HjApLmI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naf_HjApLmI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT6M48S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"501","dislikeCount":"20","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1328","viewCount":"18713"}},{"id":"F5_4uGZzTb0","snippet":{"description":"Despite some incredible success, Zillow has recently run into some hurdles which caused their market cap to decline by $1.6 Billion - here\u2019s why.

And second, their newest addition: a mortgage company, where Zillow can now begin to originate their own loans. \n\nThe criticism comes from both home owners and investor expectations\u2026for home owners, the process isn\u2019t quite as fast as they seemed. Flipping homes is also risky. Tying up assets is risky. Spending your resources home flipping can be a delicate matter, \n\nBut now, Zillow expands into a different market\u2026the mortgage market. And oddly enough, the stock continues to drop. Why? For INVESTORS\u2026which, lets be real, this is a business that has to appease INVESTORS\u2026this just means uncertainty and risk. Getting into the mortgage industry at a time where rates have begun going UP is, again, maybe another risk that they didn\u2019t need to take. With investors uncertain about its slowing growth, its high expectations from home flipping, and rising rates\u2026it makes sense that investors would be spooked about ANYTHING the company does that isn\u2019t it\u2019s core business\u2026which is advertising. \n\nZillow makes a LOT of money from their Zillow premier agents, and it\u2019s a pretty good business all the way around. THIS is the platform they should expand further\u2026since they\u2019re in advertising, have homes LINK to furniture you can buy. Promote architects. Promote contractors. Promote ANYTHING related to homes that buyers or sellers want to see\u2026ANYTHING. Promote Premier Lenders! Promote Premier Contractors!\n\nZillow has slowly been seeing a saturation of premier agents on their site as growth has slowed. The reality is that prices are climbing, competition is fierce, and agents are spending their money wisely. It\u2019s this uncertainty and risk taking that could be Zillow\u2019s downfall, or it\u2019s saving grace. In my opinion, originating loans makes sense\u2026anything to streamline the process, in my opinion, is a positive. But do I think THIS is the right time to do that, as their growth is slowing and as rates are rising? Eh, maybe not. Instead, I believe their core focus should be advertising first and foremost, everything else secondary. Continue growing the advertising platform, while at the same time offering more options for the people watching the site, and this is recipe to success. But what do I know. \n\nI think the simple lesson is not to deviate too far away from what works. If you have something that works well, expand on it. Add to it, improve it, and make it better. Don\u2019t necessarily take big risks elsewhere when you have one endeavor working so well. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3\n\nSources:\nhttps:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4163007-zillow-need-panic-instant-offers\nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/zillow-to-buy-mortgage-lender-to-help-its-home-flipping-business\nhttps:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/04\/13\/investing\/zillow-house-flipping\/index.html?iid=EL\nhttps:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/zillow-struggles-to-find-new-growth-1533667427\nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-07\/tesla-jumps-on-report-of-saudis-building-about-2-billion-stake\nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/zillow-stock-suffering-biggest-plunge-in-six-years-as-host-of-analysts-slash-price-targets-2018-08-07\nhttps:\/\/www.inman.com\/2018\/08\/07\/zillow-market-cap-plummets-after-mortgage-acquisition-earnings\/","publishedAt":"2018-08-10T22:30:01Z","tags":["zillow","zillow homes for sale","zillow rentals","zillow premier agents","redfin real estate","redfin real estate agent","redfin review","real estate market","real estate market analysis","real estate market drop","real estate market 2018","real estate marketing ideas","real estate market prediction","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","passive income","passive income 2018","grant cardone","dave ramsey"],"title":"Zillow's $1.6 Billion Dollar Mistake: What NOT To Do","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F5_4uGZzTb0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F5_4uGZzTb0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F5_4uGZzTb0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F5_4uGZzTb0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F5_4uGZzTb0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M37S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"311","dislikeCount":"56","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1492","viewCount":"58709"}},{"id":"Ag-6CUoj7Ec","snippet":{"description":"These are the 5 things I wish I had known before becoming a landlord, and why learning these NOW can make you a better real estate investor in the long run. Enjoy!

At this point, I had been working as a real estate agent for a little over 3.5 years and even though I had been doing a lot of rentals for OTHER PEOPLE, I had never done it for myself. All of a sudden you have a hard time thinking objectively, you throw your own emotions into the mix, you have self doubt, you worry if what you\u2019re doing is right, and there\u2019s a blurred line between running this like a business vs a hobby\u2026and when I started, I ran it like a hobby. Don\u2019t do that. \n\nThis brings me to my second point\u2026keep things professional, and STICK TO THE CONTRACT. \nIn the beginning, I treated the contract more like a guide\u2026as long as you roughly followed it, that was fine. No, NO, NO. Do NOT do this. Enforce the contract word for word. The contract is written for a reason - there should be no misinterpretation from what\u2019s allowed and what\u2019s agreed on. This clarifies everyone\u2019s expectations for not only the tenant, but also for the landlord. When that contract is signed, all parties must abide by it. \n\nThe third thing I wish I knew was that I\u2019d need to be on call 24\/7. \nIf there\u2019s ever an emergency, I have my phone on me to handle anything as it comes up. Most situations that come up, even though I\u2019m technically \u201con call 24\/7,\u201d just aren\u2019t that urgent; usually little minor things that are usually sent over email and you can handle them when you have the time.\n\nThe fourth thing I wish I knew is that anything that can possibly break, will break.\nAs a landlord, you walk into the brutal reality that most people simply don\u2019t care about how they live or how delicate something is. Just like you baby proof a house, you will need to renter-proof your house. This means making things indestructible. If something is likely to break, make sure you don\u2019t spend too much money on it. Just buy good quality DURABLE, not high end BREAKABLE. This will prevent you from fixing and buying new things after every tenant. \n\nThe fifth thing is that the biggest learning experience of all of them is simply dealing with people. \nOn a bigger picture, deeper down, you really have to learn to communicate effectively, be ok with saying no, be okay with standing your ground, while still being able to hear the other person out. You need to learn how to explain yourself in a way that makes sense to the other person, without coming off as insensitive or inattentive. The other person needs to be heard and their thoughts validated before you can say what you want. Just like anything else, people skills are incredibly important and can make a huge difference in whatever business your in. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-08T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategy","real estate 2018","real estate investing with no money","how to be a landlord","real estate investing 101","how to make money in real estate","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate at a young age","passive income strategies","passive income online","passive income real estate","passive income ideas"],"title":"The 5 things I wish I knew before becoming a Landlord...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ag-6CUoj7Ec\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ag-6CUoj7Ec\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ag-6CUoj7Ec\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ag-6CUoj7Ec\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ag-6CUoj7Ec\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1119","dislikeCount":"305","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"24695","viewCount":"354934"}},{"id":"Ax86jNXzwhk","snippet":{"description":"When I spot something that seems to have potential, I\u2019ll talk about it and share my opinion - and in this case, I think we could be at the beginning of something big\u2026and that is the electric scooter. Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c\n\nSo lets start here: what am I talking about. These are electric scooters (such as Bird Scooters, or Lime Scooters) that are placed randomly throughout densely populated cities. If you come across one, you can download the app - scan the barcode, and for only $1, you can activate this electric scooter. After that, it\u2019s generally 15 cents for every minute it\u2019s in use. You can ride it as long as you like, and when you get to your destination or when you\u2019re just done using it, you can drop it off whenever you are and walk away. If you want to find one to ride, you simply go on the app and it\u2019ll show you all the scooters in the area that you can walk to and use. \u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s really such a simple concept that I didn\u2019t fully understand until I tried it. And then I got it. Not only can it get you from point A to B for cheaper than an Uber for nearby distances, but it\u2019s fun. In what seems like an overnight success, these Electric Bird Scooters have dominated LA with an almost cult-like following. Scooter-Company Lime has recently been valued at $1.1 BILLION. Uber recently made a sizable investment in their recent round of funding of $335 MILLION DOLLARS. And Uber intends to promote Lime scooters through their mobile app\u2026a move that gets them one step closer to interstellar domination. Another company, Bird, is doing something similar\u2026just one year old, this Scooter Company is now valued at a whopping $2 billion dollars. In a year. \n\nThe appeal to these companies valuation is the network effect, where its core value lies within how many people use it - once it gets large enough, it just becomes self sustainable. Much like Uber pretty much having the monopoly on ride-sharing, there will inevitably be a battle between Scooter companies to see who can gather the largest user base, who can scale the fastest, and who can get their scooters out first in more cities. Whoever comes out ahead will carve and solidify their business in an emerging industry that\u2019s only poised to grow bigger from here.\u00a0\n\nIn the process, this has also created some unique money-making opportunities, much like Uber did with its drivers. With Bird Scooters, you have what\u2019s called \u201cBird Hunting\u201d - this is like real life Pokemon go where you locate these scooters at night, charge them, and return them back to pre-determined locations\u2026and you get paid $5-$20 per scooter that you find. \n\nI think we should all keep an eye on electric scooters\u2026I think we\u2019re at the very beginning of an industry that has only more room to grow and evolve. And whether or not it\u2019s scooters or something else that eventually crops up, it\u2019s very evident that the mobile renting business model is brilliant. Whether it\u2019s cars, scooters, renting rooms AirBnB, or maybe one day people are renting out their driveway parking spaces, construction tools, or electronics\u2026the sharing culture is only going to grow. So keep an eye on this, I think we can look back at this in 5 years from now and realize that we were there when it first started.\u00a0\n\nAnd for all the young entrepreneurs out there - sometimes these simple ideas are often the best. I honestly believe this was just so simple that no one thought of it. We have a natural tendency to overcomplicate things, but besides the legal aspects of actually getting this up and running\u2026the business model is just so, so simple.\u00a0\n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-06T22:30:00Z","tags":["bird scooter","lime scooter","electric scooter","bird scooter trick","bird scooter startup","lime scooter startup","electric scooter fad","lime scooter san fransisco","entrepreneur advice","entrepreneur","startup companies","electric scooter app","uber business model","lyft business model","how to make money online","how to make money online 2018","how to make passive income","passive income 2018","passive income ideas","passive income 101","casey neistat","casey neistat electric scooter"],"title":"Why The $1 Electric Scooter Will TAKE OVER The World","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax86jNXzwhk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax86jNXzwhk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax86jNXzwhk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax86jNXzwhk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax86jNXzwhk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M18S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"595","dislikeCount":"57","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1652","viewCount":"40344"}},{"id":"E9Ve_ruN2fo","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered just how much money you\u2019d actually need to in order to be Financially Independent, to quit your job, and retire early? Here\u2019s the answer. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram\/Snapchat: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF + FREE Coaching Call FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nFirst, lets define \u201cfinancially independent,\u201d because this term means different things to different people. To me, it\u2019s having enough money to support your current lifestyle without you ever needing to earn another dollar. It\u2019s knowing that you\u2019ll have a certain amount of money at your disposal every single month that covers your daily expenses without ever running out. \n\nFor each of us, that number is different. For someone in rural Kentucky, maybe it takes $35,000 per year to cover all of your expenses\u2026food, housing, entertainment, health insurance, just everything you\u2019d ordinarily spend in a given year. For someone in New York City, maybe that number is closer to $90,000 per year\u2026or maybe for a family of 5 in Southern California, it\u2019s $125,000 per year. But what\u2019s unique is that even though each of us will have a different level to what we\u2019d consider financially independent, the math behind it stays exactly the same. \n\nFor most situations, how much you need invested in order to retire is as simple as this: 25x your annual expenses. This means if you want to spend $50,000 per year, you\u2019ll need 25 times that\u2026or $1,250,000. You want to spend $80,000 a year? You\u2019ll need 25x that, or $2,000,000 invested. Spend $100,000 per year = invest $2,500,000. \n\nIn order to accurately do this, it requires you to really sit down and think about the lifestyle you want, how much it\u2019s going to cost, and what you currently spend. By first going over your current expenses\u2026and literally counting every cent that goes in and out of your account, you\u2019ll get a great baseline as to how much you regularly spend on a monthly basis. From there, determine if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d want and how much that will cost. Once you add everything up\u2026multiply that number over 12 months\u2026then multiply that by 25, and that\u2019s how much you\u2019ll realistically need to have saved. \n\nSo how does this work exactly when it comes to financial independence? Well, that\u2019s what\u2019s known as the \u201cSafe Withdrawal Rule\u201d or \u201cThe Trinity Study.\u201d This study suggests that you can withdrawal 4% of your total investment annually - which is usually studied as an investment portfolio consisting of 80% equities and 20% bonds, with a fairly high success rate of never running out of money. This means that for every $100 you invest, you can safely spend $4 of that each and every year for basically the rest of your life. \n.\nThis study takes into account that you\u2019re invested in 75%-80% in equities, like stocks of a corporation, and 20-25% of bonds, which represent a more stable, secure return. On average, a portfolio like this should return an average of about 7% annually adjusted for inflation over a 30+ year period. This means that your investment MAKES YOU 7% after inflation\u2026you then spend 4%\u2026leaving you with an extra 3% left over as a buffer for safety. And this is the basics of how this study is calculated. This takes about 100 years of historic data and market returns into account to determine a number that should be safe in the majority of market situations. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-03T22:30:02Z","tags":["Financial Independence","Financial Indepdendence Retire Early","Early Retirement","financial independence podcast","financial independence documentary","early retirement extreme","how to retire early","how to be financially successful","how to be financially free","retired at 26","retired at 40","passive income strategies","trinity study","4 safe withdrawal rate","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate passive income","real estate investing strategies"],"title":"How to RETIRE EARLY","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E9Ve_ruN2fo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E9Ve_ruN2fo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E9Ve_ruN2fo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E9Ve_ruN2fo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E9Ve_ruN2fo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"583","dislikeCount":"51","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2538","viewCount":"37108"}},{"id":"gpPQliiRNec","snippet":{"description":"Real Estate Investing Explained: These are the 5 WORST things you could do if the real estate market drops in price\u2026enjoy!

The fact remains prices won\u2019t always continue going upward, all the time. Given that, it\u2019s what you do in these times where the market DOESN\u2019T increase in price that really matters the most.\n\nThe first, and BIGGEST mistake people can make if the market drops is to panic and make emotionally-driven decisions. This is, by FAR, the worst thing you could possibly do. The reality is that accurately timing the market is nearly impossible - even the BEST people won\u2019t be able to predict when the markets will drop, how long they\u2019ll drop, or when they\u2019ll recover. I personally believe, and many studies have confirmed, that the best investment strategy out there is to simply buy on long term fundamentals, stick with it, and hold long term. \n\nThe second mistake people make is to over-leverage and go in too heavy on an investment they cannot afford, especially if it\u2019s a volatile investment. I think it goes without saying: don\u2019t over extend yourself if you cannot afford to weather the storm. Anytime you\u2019re investing in real estate, MAKE SURE YOU CAN AFFORD IT. This means that the property doesn\u2019t consume all of your income. It means you already have a safety  fund in place in the event you need it. It means that you\u2019re able to buy the property and still save\/invest a portion of your income. \n\nThe third mistake people make is buying purely for the short term. Some may disagree with me on this, but I think there\u2019s a big difference between investing and speculating - if you\u2019re buying something with the intention of selling in a year because it\u2019ll be worth more, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a little more akin to speculation. The longer you own real estate for, the more likely you are to come out ahead. \n\nThe fourth mistake people make is play it too safe. These are the people who have been saying \u201cReal estate is a bubble\u201d since 2013. These are the people who said the stock market is over valued since 2014. These are the people who typically just never invest because they\u2019re constantly waiting for things to drop\u2026oddly enough, those same people never invested at the bottom of the market because they were convinced it was going to drop further. And they\u2019ll wait a lifetime for that opportunity, meanwhile their cash simply loses purchasing power to inflation every year. \n\nThe fifth mistake you can make is not to have enough cash on hand to take advantage of deals that come up. One of the biggest advantages I\u2019ve had in my investing career is that I\u2019ve always saved as much money as I could. I\u2019d save, save save\u2026and when I found a deal, I\u2019d buy it. I\u2019d then go right back to saving\u2026and when another deal would come up, I\u2019d buy it. I didn\u2019t care about market timing, I didn\u2019t care what prices would be a year from now\u2026I simply saw a good deal, I knew I could add value, I knew it would make money, I knew I could comfortably afford it, and that was that. Having cash on hand has allowed me invest in properties that have, combined, made me over a million dollars in profit. \n\nThe moral of this entire video is really just to make sure: buy on fundamentals. Buy a deal that still makes money in a worst case scenario. Don\u2019t over extend yourself, and make sure you keep some cash to cover anything unexpected. Don\u2019t worry about short term real estate prices, buy on a long term outlook. And don\u2019t bother trying to time the market\u2026just wait until you find the right deal and go for it. \n\nFor business inquiries or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-08-01T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investment","real estate passive income","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 2018","real estate market correction","real estate drop","real estate market 2018","passive income strategies","meet kevin","grant cardone","real estate mentor","real estate coach","real estate 101","investing 101","investment strategy","real estate investing 101","millionaire lifestyle","stock market 101"],"title":"The 5 WORST MISTAKES you can make if the Real Estate Market DROPS","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gpPQliiRNec\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gpPQliiRNec\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gpPQliiRNec\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gpPQliiRNec\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gpPQliiRNec\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M19S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"471","dislikeCount":"39","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2427","viewCount":"50781"}},{"id":"_29IZ_UI92Q","snippet":{"description":"The tools are out there right now for to to become a millionaire and absolutely crush it at whatever you want to accomplish, but without implementing these 5 things, it\u2019s almost inevitable that you will eventually fail. Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME with Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nThe first thing I\u2019ve noticed highly successful people all do, and something I\u2019ve been implementing a lot lately, as well, is to consciously reframe EVERYTHING as a positive - you literally start to train your brain to begin thinking \u201cThis is the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to me, and will bring me something even better.\u201d Because when you\u2019re making money, when you\u2019re building a business, you WILL have so many setbacks along the way. It becomes just as much a mental game as it does a strategic game.\n\nSecond\u2026let go of whatever limiting beliefs you have, whatever grudges you have, whatever negative thoughts are slowing you down\u2026just let go of it. Highly skilled people DON\u2019T HAVE THE TIME to sit around dwelling on a negative situation that holds them back. If you\u2019re being really honest with yourself right now, I almost GUARANTEE you\u2019re holding on to something that you haven\u2019t let go, that\u2019s still bringing you down, in some part of your life. Find out what this is and accept it from whatever it is, assure yourself that that experience can make you into a better, stronger person, and release it from your mind. The most successful people I know always look forward, not backwards. \n\nThird\u2026speaking of forwards, focus on the END GAME and the END RESULT. If you don\u2019t know what your end game is, how do you ever expect to get there? You have to know exactly what you want, and why you want it. And if you don\u2019t really know what you want, then that\u2019s the FIRST thing you need to work on. You shouldn\u2019t do ANYTHING until you\u2019ve figured out what you want and the person you want to be. You will get whatever you actively focus on, and this is crucial to getting what you want.\n\nFourth, however, ties into the third\u2026you NEED to feel deserving of it. If you don\u2019t feel like you deserve something, you will ALWAYS subconsciously self sabotage yourself. ALWAYS. The saying is so true, you attract what you ARE\u2026you GET what you BELIEVE. If you don\u2019t believe something is possible, I GUARANTEE you won\u2019t make it happen. We always prove ourselves right. You gotta understand that no matter what you want, you are just as deserving as anyone else. You deserve all the money you want, you deserve whatever lifestyle you want, you deserve to have it all\u2026you just have to first, believe, you can have it. \n\nAnd finally, you have to feel grateful. You have to realize that everything is really a blessing, and be thankful for having what you have. So take a moment, right now, and just be grateful you\u2019ve got the time to sit and watch a video like this. Probably half the population won\u2019t even have access to what you have. They don\u2019t even have the luxury of having the time to watch YouTube videos. So you\u2019ve got it pretty good, make sure to appreciate that from time to time. \n\nAnd those 5 things are what I\u2019ve noticed from every single high level, financially successful, person out there who\u2019s also EMOTIONALLY just a happy person. This is really the true Millionaire Mindset. This really needs to be the foundation from what you build up a financially successful empire from. If you aren\u2019t happy with what you have right now, then it\u2019s proven that your current ways aren\u2019t working - you need to change something. And the first thing most people need to change is their beliefs and thoughts about themselves. These are the 5 areas I\u2019ve noticed have the biggest impact, and the best outcome for you to focus on, to be financially successful and fulfilled. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-28T20:00:04Z","tags":["how i became a millionaire","how to be a millionaire in 3 years","how to become a millionaire by 25","how to become a millionaire by 30","millionaire at 26","how to save a million dollars","millionaire lifestyle","Millionaire Mindset","how to invest money","self help motivation","millionaire motivation","passive income motivation","real estate motivation","how to be successful","how to be successful in life","how to be wealthy","how to make money online","how to make money in real estate"],"title":"Why You Won\u2019t Become a Millionaire","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_29IZ_UI92Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_29IZ_UI92Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_29IZ_UI92Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_29IZ_UI92Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_29IZ_UI92Q\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1730","dislikeCount":"246","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"22329","viewCount":"278225"}},{"id":"AbB_-I_ilVY","snippet":{"description":"Real Estate Agent and Author Ryan Serhant reveals how he sold $1 Billion Dollars in New York City Real Estate in a single year, and how you can also build your career in the Real Estate industry\u2026enjoy!

It\u2019s not me telling you not to get cards with high annual fees without benefits\u2026instead, I\u2019m telling you about the importance of FREEZING YOUR CREDIT. \n\nEquifax Freeze:\nhttps:\/\/www.freeze.equifax.com\/\n\nTrasunion Freeze:\nhttps:\/\/www.transunion.com\/credit-freeze\n\nExperian Freeze:\nhttps:\/\/www.experian.com\/freeze\/center.html\n\nHere\u2019s how it works. You have three credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and Trasunion. When someone pulls your credit information, they\u2019ll pulling the data from these agencies which use their own algorithms and data to calculate your credit score. Many people don\u2019t know that they have the option to place a FREEZE on these accounts, which means that NO ONE can run your credit while the freeze is in place, which means that someone won\u2019t be able to take out a loan, won\u2019t be able to open up credit cards, and won\u2019t be able to have access to that information to take advantage of. A Freeze restricts your credit report so that it can't be accessed by a new lender. If a lender can't see your credit report, they won't issue a new account in your name. Simple as that.\n\nWhen you freeze your account, you\u2019d typically log in online to one of the agencies, prove it\u2019s you who\u2019s requesting the freeze, and you will be issued a PIN number specific to that account\u2026the ONLY way to unfreeze that account is with that pin, which is only generated once, and something that you typically write down and save in a safe place. So whenever YOU actually want to apply for a loan, you go and unfreeze your accounts with that PIN - you get your loan - and then you can re-freeze the account after the lender runs your credit.\n\nPreviously, to do this, credit reporting agencies would CHARGE YOU to do this. That was, until Congress amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act to require reporting agencies to freeze reports for no charge. Yes, it\u2019s FREE. There\u2019s NO REASON NOT TO DO THIS if you\u2019re not in the middle of applying for a loan, getting new credit cards, etc. \n\nDo this. Please. I did this as soon as it was available to me, and absolutely no regrets. In addition to that, it\u2019s important to monitor your credit report every few weeks - this is something I do anyway for fun since I like seeing my credit score go up, but consider using CreditKarma.com or CreditSesame.com - they\u2019re both totally free and easy to use. Just sign up, turn on notifications so they send you updates anytime something is changed, and that\u2019s it. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-24T22:30:00Z","tags":["credit card","credit card 101","credit card freeze","credit freeze","credit cards for beginners","credit card mistake","how to increase your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit card limit","how to increase your credit score in 30 days","credit card churning","credit card points","ask sebby","the credit shifu","the points guy","credit score explained","creditkarma","creditsesame","credit score increase","credit score to buy a house","credit score 101"],"title":"Warning: How to Avoid the BIGGEST Credit Card Mistake!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/STB5L2BfyYc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/STB5L2BfyYc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/STB5L2BfyYc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/STB5L2BfyYc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/STB5L2BfyYc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M30S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"589","dislikeCount":"41","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3743","viewCount":"36549"}},{"id":"FbuiPcgLyt4","snippet":{"description":"Dave Ramsey got his real estate license at 18 years old, invested in Real Estate in his early 20\u2019s, amassed a $4 million dollar portfolio with a net worth of about $1 million dollars by the age of 26\u2026and then lost it all and filed for bankruptcy.

Dave Ramsey got his real estate license at the age of 18 and began investing in Real Estate in the early 1980\u2019s\u2026he\u2019d buy foreclosures, fix them up, and sell them. So what do most investors do when they finance real estate flips? They take out SHORT TERM LOANS to save money. \n\nLoose lending practices in the early 80\u2019s made this an attractive option for quick flip real estate investors\u2026buy a property, immediately fix it up, and flip it within 45-90 days. By the time the deal is done, the loan is paid off. This is how Dave made a substantial amount of money, rather quickly, in his 20\u2019s - and much of his one-million net worth was speculated from high appraised real estate values.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things went wrong\u2026by the mid 1980\u2019s, real estate values were artificially high, fueled by tax codes which made real estate a favorable method of tax avoidance. See, many wealthy investors chose to dump all of their money in real estate rather than other assets, which inflated values way beyond where they should be\u2026.that was, until, the Tax Reform Act of 1986. \n\nThis changed everything and real estate values came dropping down as demand for real estate dwindled. At that point, his largest lender was acquired by a bigger bank, who began looking more closely at Dave Ramsey\u2019s loans and determined they were too risky for them to continue renewing these 90-day terms. The bank demanded that he pay off his loan within the 90 days that was originally agreed upon, with no further extensions to given. \n\nHe had invested in a market that was inflated by investors seeking tax deductions, on short term 90-day loans, expecting to flip the property for a profit.\n\nThis is the BIGGEST difference between Dave Ramsey is this: I take advantage of long term, 30-year fixed rate loans that don\u2019t change. My interest rate doesn\u2019t go up, banks can\u2019t just call it due anytime they feel like it, and the price is the price no matter what happens. When the numbers work, doing this is very safe and as long as the property makes money, your worst case scenario is usually just breaking even and then having a paid off home in 30 years.\n\nIf Dave Ramsey had a 30-year fixed rate loan, as long as the properties cash flowed, he could\u2019ve just held them\u2026and if he held properties that he bought in the 1980\u2019s, chances are he\u2019d have a TON of money by now. Not only that, but if he took out 30-year loans, not only would he have very, very valuable real estate in 2018 - but they\u2019d be ENTIRELY PAID OFF! \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-21T21:30:00Z","tags":["Dave Ramsey","Dave Ramsey Real Estate","dave ramsey live","dave ramsey baby steps","dave ramsey budgeting","dave ramsey rant","dave ramsey credit cards","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing strategies 2018","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing step by step","real estate investing 101","real estate investing with no money","wholesaling real estate","flipping real estate","how to invest in real estate"],"title":"Bankrupt by 28: Why Dave Ramsey lost MILLIONS in Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FbuiPcgLyt4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FbuiPcgLyt4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FbuiPcgLyt4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FbuiPcgLyt4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FbuiPcgLyt4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M15S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2132","dislikeCount":"800","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"38291","viewCount":"696751"}},{"id":"6OyCZL9B3Wg","snippet":{"description":"Investing in Gold can be one of the worst investments out there, and I\u2019ll explain why this isn\u2019t quite the \u201cGolden Opportunity\u201d people think it is\u2026and why this investment won\u2019t always \u201cPan Out.\u201d Enjoy.

And is this even an investment to begin with? Since gold was a fairly fixed price prior to 1970, we can really only look back at the last 45 years of data to determine the average price of gold, and adjust that for inflation. If we take the price in 1978 of $208 an ounce, we can reasonable determine that would be $838 in today\u2019s money. As we know, gold right NOW is $1200 an ounce. This means that effectively your gold went up in value 45% adjusted for inflation\u2026over 40 YEARS. Just as a comparison, the SP500 index went up in value 630% during that same period, adjusted for inflation. \n\nSo given that\u2026in 40 YEARS, gold only went up - on average - of about 1% annually, adjusted for inflation. Versus the SP500, which went up in value 5x MORE during that same period. \n\nFirst, Gold is also just really, REALLY inefficient to invest in. Owning PHYSICAL gold has many drawbacks\u2026first, there\u2019s a wide spread between bid and ask prices to ensure that the moment you purchase gold, you are IMMEDIATELY underwater on your so-called \u201cinvestment.\u201d Then you have shipping costs for an expensive metal that you\u2019ll have to include, as well. Then once you get your gold investment, you\u2019ll have to figure out how you\u2019ll store it. Other companies charge you for storing your gold.\n\nAnother important distinction when it comes to gold is that gold doesn\u2019t throw off cash, much like a stock\u2019s ability to produce income for the share holder. It doesn\u2019t give you interest\u2026it just kinda sits there, looking pretty. \n\nSo why do people even consider this an investment? Or why is this even called a hedge against an inflation? Well\u2026the reality, is that it\u2019s neither. It\u2019s a hedge against FEAR. The more people FEAR about inflation, economic issues, or defaults\u2026the higher the price of gold climbs. The thought process is that while paper currency can\u2019t be trusted, GOLD will also retain value. But U.S. Treasuries Securities have never been defaulted upon in anyone's lifetime.\n\nSo here\u2019s the moral of the story\u2026golds prices are correlated with our fear in the economy, whether or not it\u2019s warranted. After its peak in 2011, when was pretty much the BEST and lowest times to buy just about anything in the markets, gold was at its highest\u2026and has been on a slow decline since then. And remember Warren Buffets \u201cGolden\u201d Rule? Be GREEDY when others are FEARFUL\u2026and FEARFUL people are the ones buying GOLD. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-19T22:30:02Z","tags":["gold","gold investing","gold investing for beginners","gold investing 2018","gold investing news","gold investing strategies","gold investing for dummies","investing gold coins","gold coins","silver coins","investing in silver","investing in silver beginner","silver investing news","silver investing tips","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2018","stock market 101","stock market news","investing in stocks","gold mining","silver mining","platinum coin"],"title":"A warning about Investing in Gold...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6OyCZL9B3Wg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6OyCZL9B3Wg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6OyCZL9B3Wg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6OyCZL9B3Wg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6OyCZL9B3Wg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2829","dislikeCount":"3722","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6305","viewCount":"248260"}},{"id":"-fDOJ8zqnOk","snippet":{"description":"Real Estate Investing isn\u2019t for everyone, and it\u2019s important that we all take a realistic look at not only what makes it a good investment, but also why some people may chose to look elsewhere - enjoy!

If you\u2019re not prepared to put in a LOT of work upfront, real estate investing isn\u2019t for you. What most people will see happen is that they\u2019ll invest a substantial amount of time and money buying the right deal, and then once they buy that deal, it\u2019s less exciting than they thought. Real estate investing is often something you set up now, where the benefits and payoff comes years later.\n\nSecond, you should NOT invest in real estate if you don\u2019t understand how it work. This isn\u2019t limited to just real estate, this is ANYTHING you invest in\u2026stocks, cryptocurrency, businesses, it DOESN\u2019T MATTER. If you don\u2019t fully understand it, don\u2019t invest in it. Largely, the people who lose money in real estate simply don\u2019t understand values, don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, over leverage themselves, and become emotional in the event the market goes down\u2026or get too greedy and hold out when they want to sell. \n\nThird, you should NOT invest in real estate if it\u2019s meant to be a short term play. I\u2019ll be the first to admit, this doesn\u2019t apply to everyone in every circumstance\u2026and people could disagree with me and they wouldn\u2019t be wrong. But chances are, if you\u2019re learning about real estate investing, you should NOT invest in real estate for immediate short term profit. The reality is that we don\u2019t know if you will absolutely be profitable within 1-5 years to a point where it makes sense to sell. A lot can happen in the market in the short term, and if you go in with a short term outlook, there are so many variables with could disrupt your plan. Long term holding can overcome a lot of other obstacles along the way.\n\nFourth, don\u2019t invest in real estate if you don\u2019t have the TIME to devote to it. It\u2019s NOT a passive investment without a substantial amount of work from the very beginning. If you don\u2019t have the time to dedicate to this, either factor in the cost of a property manager or don\u2019t invest. The last thing you need is to plunk down a significant chunk of money on something that you can\u2019t give the attention it needs to make it worth it. This will be a time intensive process to get it streamlined to the point where you won\u2019t need to spend much time on it.. \n\nFinally, don\u2019t invest in real estate if you don\u2019t like real estate. I know this doesn\u2019t apply to most of you, but you\u2019d be surprised that some people JUST DON\u2019T LIKE REAL ESTATE. They don\u2019t like tenants, they don\u2019t like dealing with people, they don\u2019t like the responsibility, they don\u2019t want to be be tied down to a location \u2026instead, they\u2019d rather make money from a laptop on the beach without having to deal with anyone. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but it should go without saying - you should only invest in real estate if you actually have an interest in real estate. There are a lot of nuances when it comes to looking at properties, areas, architecture, styles, and trends that if you just aren\u2019t interested in it, you won\u2019t give it the attention it really needs to be profitable. Things will fall through the cracks, they don\u2019t be done as well as they could be, and that means less money in your pocket. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-17T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2018","real estate market","real estate agent","real estate investor","how i became a millionaire","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","real estate investing for dummies","grant cardone","rich dad poor dad","biggerpockets","why you shouldnt invest in real estate","graham stephan","passive income real estate","how to make passive income"],"title":"Why you SHOULDN'T invest in Real Estate...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-fDOJ8zqnOk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-fDOJ8zqnOk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-fDOJ8zqnOk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-fDOJ8zqnOk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-fDOJ8zqnOk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M28S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"614","dislikeCount":"131","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6864","viewCount":"120750"}},{"id":"pTX_SXbzNdk","snippet":{"description":"Despite how much I actually like Zillow, Trulia, Redfin, etc\u2026we\u2019re going to talk about one of my BIGGEST pet peeves out there\u2026and that is the almighty Zestimate and Automated Valuation Models. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nJust about every real estate website offers a service where computer calculations look at public record data, recently sold properties, recently listed properties, and then aggregates all of that data to then provide an estimated value of what they think that specific home is worth. It\u2019s a fun concept, and theoretically, it should give you a fairly realistic number of what a specific home is worth. The problem, however\u2026is that it doesn\u2019t. \n\nThe problem is that a home\u2019s value is extremely intricate - and public record data only makes up for a small portion of a homes value. Consider this, what Zillow and similar websites do to create their estimate is aggregate public record data of all nearby homes based on Zip Code and Street. They first compile a list of every single home\u2019s LISTED square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and lot size. This creates their base from which to work from. From there, they look at recently sold properties within those areas to determine a base price per square foot. They then compare that data with the sale price of every single home and create a guideline of what price they THINK that specific home is worth based on that data. At a very basic level, it works\u2026from a numbers standpoint, you look at how big the home is, how big the lot is, how many bedrooms and bathrooms it is\u2026and you compare it with something similar to that which recently sold within that area. Or they use a combination of average price per square foot, and come up with an average value. \n\nThe Washington Post recently did some research, and determined that only HALF of Zillow\u2019s estimates fell within a 5% range of value\u2026that means more than HALF of estimates are off by more than 5% either OVER or UNDER. Zillow itself claims that 75% of homes sell within a 10% range, higher or lower, and 89% of homes sell within a 20% range\u2026I\u2019d just hate to be one of those homes in the remaining 11%. \n\nThe reality is that to come up with a value of a property, you really need to calculate it on a case by case basis. You really need to consider every single home on a case by case basis on its own to come up with a reasonable value. This is something that an algorithm isn\u2019t able to do within a reasonable amount of accuracy. \n\nSo for anyone out there, it\u2019s important not to rely on Zillow\u2019s estimates. If anything, just ignore them or use them exclusively just for entertainment purposes only.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-14T22:30:00Z","tags":["zillow","zillow lying","zestimates","zillow estimates","trulia","redfin","realtor","redfin agent","zillow premier agent","zillow homes for sale","zestimate accuracy","real estate","real estate investing","real estate agent","real estate investing 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategy 2018","real estate agent day in the life","real estate agent 101","how to get your real estate license","redfin real estate","how to invest in real estate","passive income"],"title":"These Real Estate Websites are lying to you\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pTX_SXbzNdk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pTX_SXbzNdk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pTX_SXbzNdk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pTX_SXbzNdk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pTX_SXbzNdk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"769","dislikeCount":"151","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7241","viewCount":"211028"}},{"id":"fyQ2oYu3NR4","snippet":{"description":"Sometimes the best investments aren\u2019t monetary\u2026instead, they\u2019re investments in other areas which later come back to you, financially. So here are the best ways you can INVEST\u2026without investing any money, at any age. Enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nThe first investment you can make\u2026is investing in knowledge. Go with cheaper or free resources first\u2026YouTube is free. Google is free. Books are cheap if you buy them used on Amazon. Some of the best skills you can pick up literally require nothing but your own dedication to learn them. \n\nThe second way to invest\u2026is investing your TIME. This is a no brainer, obviously you spend time on YouTube, you spend time learning\u2026but my best recommend is to spend time WORKING just to get the experience, because I promise those experiences will be invaluable later in life. Lets first talk about working for \u201cfree\u201d just for the experience\u2026while each of us might have a different perspective on this, I really believe working for free could be a tremendous advantage for both your own experience, and to get your foot in the door of an industry you wouldn\u2019t normally be able to get into. If you have the opportunity to take the initiative and offer someone something free just for experience, DO IT. Don\u2019t plan to work for free forever, because you should get paid at some point\u2026but don\u2019t let money get in the way.\n\nThe THIRD way to invest\u2026is to grow your social skills. This is something not often talked about, but this is easily the most important. If anything, make an effort to socialize, and meet people. Having a good support group of like-minded people will make such a tremendous difference in your life. Like they say, you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with\u2026what do those people say about you? I\u2019m not saying go and ditch your friends, but make a conscious effort to meet and surround yourself with people doing BETTER than you.\n\nThe fourth thing to invest in\u2026is sales skills. If anyone is wondering what the best job to get while they\u2019re in their teens or early 20\u2019s for the experience, it\u2019s sales. By far. Sales is everything\u2026you have to learn how to successfully sell yourself to an employer. You have to understand how the mind works, why people buy something, and how that benefits them. Sales is all about providing something that the other person wants and will use. Not only that, but sales is also customer service at its core\u2026it\u2019s no surprise that sales is the one skill you can transfer to just about any industry. It\u2019s practically recession proof, that you can apply to any location.\n\nSales is also a business that\u2019s not limited or capped at a salary\u2026in most cases, your income is only dependent on the results you get. This is such a great mentality to have, because mediocrity is never rewarded, and your income potential is as much as you want. You become your only limiting factor, and you are solely responsible for what you do\u2026and again, this is just such a great life skill to have that can be molded and adapted to any industry. \n\nAll of this is  really about utilizing what you have right now\u2026and that is time. Use it wisely. Invest your time learning new skills that\u2019ll pay for themselves 10-fold in a few years. Work for free for the experience that you\u2019ll remember for a lifetime, that\u2019ll help you in every job you do going forward. Put yourself in uncomfortable situations so you can meet the people who are going to help lift you up to the next level. Learn sales skills so you can property articulate and explain your ideas to someone else, in a way that they\u2019ll resonate with.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-12T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","investing strategies 2018","investing for beginners","investing for teens","how to invest in your teens","investing in stocks for beginners","investing 101","real estate investing 101","real estate 101","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","investing in real estate","investing in your 20s","how to invest in your 30s","Money tips","money tips for young people","passive income","passive income strategies","best investments"],"title":"The BEST Investments you can make RIGHT NOW...for FREE","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fyQ2oYu3NR4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fyQ2oYu3NR4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fyQ2oYu3NR4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fyQ2oYu3NR4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fyQ2oYu3NR4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M37S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1290","dislikeCount":"96","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7088","viewCount":"85655"}},{"id":"u4shnI90S-U","snippet":{"description":"For those of you that know, I\u2019ve been looking to buy more real estate here in Los Angeles.

They ended up getting several offers, and asked for a best and final. I made that offer at what the property was fundamentally worth, based on all the sold comparable and similar homes on the market. Unfortunately, other people were willing to over pay WAY more than what it was worth, and my offer was denied. However, later they came back to me when their higher offers fell through. I have a feeling the previous buyers regretted paying what they did, and felt it was best to back out. \n\nNow that I\u2019m back in the picture, I made another offer at exactly what I felt the home was worth, given the square footage, size, condition, and other sold properties. However, again - that offer was rejected, even though I felt it was a very good offer for what I was offering. I can\u2019t get into too many details at this point, but I thought my offer should\u2019ve gotten accepted ;) \n\nLesson here: If you know what a property is worth, don\u2019t over pay. Stick to your price. It\u2019s a logical decision to move forward or not, and if you feel something is worth what you\u2019re paying, don\u2019t pay more. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-11T21:00:04Z","tags":["real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing strategies 2018","real estate market","real estate market cycle","real estate 2018","real estate agent","real estate coach","real estate mentor","passive income","how to invest in real estate","real estate agent career","real estate agent day in the life","real estate investor millionaire","how i became a millionaire","passive income ideas","passive income real estate"],"title":"Just made an offer to buy another property...this is what happened","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u4shnI90S-U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u4shnI90S-U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u4shnI90S-U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u4shnI90S-U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u4shnI90S-U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"643","dislikeCount":"90","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4227","viewCount":"111452"}},{"id":"9WiqIirBLik","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s a topic that\u2019s slowly beginning to gain some mainstream attention\u2026and that is the era of automation and artificial intelligence.

While heavy machinery eliminated the need for manual labor on farms, it opened up those jobs increase output elsewhere\u2026from transport, grocery stores, tellers, and everything else that goes into the sale of food. While the automotive industry lost 800,000 manual labor jobs due to automation, it actually opened the door to CREATE 3.5 MILLION NEW jobs\u2026which paid, on average, $13,000 per year more. \n\nThroughout history, we\u2019ve encountered that machine innovation leads to higher productivity, which means fewer jobs are needed for that specific task, with the end result being that newer, better jobs are created to increase our net output. But is there an exponential curve as to how much we, as humans, are actually needed, until robots can eventually just create other robots to do other jobs more efficiently, until we as humans become useless and obsolete?\n\nAfter all, Elon Musk believes that will ruin mankind. He believes AI could help create our downfall, while creating a \u201csuper intelligence\u201d that humans could never compete with. So could a real-life SkyNet actually become a reality? Well, hypothetically, if AI becomes so advanced as to outperform and outsmart its creator\u2026then we as humans won\u2019t be able to conceive its powers, because it\u2019s already beyond our level of comprehension. Stephen Hawking even warned about the dangers of AI\u2026he wrote that \u201cIntelligent future AI will probably develop a drive to survive and acquire more resources as a step toward accomplishing whatever goal it has, because surviving and having more resources will increase its chances of accomplishing that other goal.\u201d \n\nNow If we\u2019re getting into a less optimistic outlook where robots get to a self-learning level where they can begin replicating and outsmarting us on a deeper level, that could be cause for concern\u2026but for it to get to this point, not only would robots have to be able to communicate and learn from each other, but would also need to be physically mobile. The capabilities of a robot would need to be so great, that I don\u2019t believe we\u2019re anywhere close to having the resources to make such a thing\u2026in hundreds of years, maybe, but not now. \n\nWhile some people want an idealized economy where machines do everything for us, the reality is that we will always want and strive for more. The hedonic treadmill is our evolutionary need to ALWAYS push the boundaries and continue advancing ourselves. I don\u2019t see us ever complacent with the same lifestyle that doesn\u2019t get better or increase over time. This means that human creation and innovation will always serve a purpose, if simply for our own selfish needs. For people who are worried about their own jobs being replaced by technology, I think it should serve as an important reminder that idleness is never rewarded, and that it\u2019s up to us to constantly grow and adapt if we want to succeed. While the next several decades might lead to further automation of many industries, this should only open the door to us to be able to leverage our time into more fulfilling, creative work where our time is much better utilized. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-10T22:30:00Z","tags":["elon musk","elon musk ai","elon musk automation","elon musk artificial intelligence","robots","automation job","automation job loss","AI movie","automation history","artificial intelligence job loss"],"title":"Elon Musk warns us: Could we all lose our jobs\u2026to Robots?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9WiqIirBLik\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9WiqIirBLik\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9WiqIirBLik\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M30S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"344","dislikeCount":"28","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"681","viewCount":"11384"}},{"id":"Rn-Vt1EZT0s","snippet":{"description":"For the last several years, I\u2019ve been able to save 100% of my income.

Doing this consistently is what leads to financial independence. This is something I\u2019ve pretty much done since I was 18\u2026I was the weird type of person who just got WAY more enjoyment being able to save money than I ever got from spending it.\n\nBecause of this, I kept my spending to a minimum, regardless of how much money I made. I re-invested all of that, and after about 7 years, my investments were throwing off enough money to pay for all of my daily expenses, allowing me to save 100% of what I made elsewhere. My thinking is that I can keep my spending strictly at what the rental income generates\u2026and each and every year, my lifestyle can get a bit better because I\u2019ll re-invest everything I make from my \u201cday job.\u201d \n\nFor all of you watching, it\u2019s really important to do a few things if you want to begin replicating this as well:\n\nThe first is to KNOW what you spend. Most people have no idea where their money goes\u2026and it\u2019s often those small $5-$10 daily charges that add up over time. So first thing is to track everything you make and everything you spend. I personally use Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com - both are amazing and work really well. \n\nThe second thing to do is to figure out what you can cut back. For instance, I don\u2019t need cable TV\u2026as long as I have an internet connection, I\u2019ve got everything I need. I don\u2019t need to got to Starbucks, I make my own iced coffee at home. I don\u2019t run the AC or keep on electricity when I\u2019m not home. I\u2019ll wait to buy something until it\u2019s on sale. It\u2019s these little tiny things that consistently add up to large amounts over time. \n\nThird\u2026Once you\u2019ve reduced what you don\u2019t really need, now work to increase your income. Sometimes cutting back isn\u2019t enough if you\u2019re just not making enough money. If this is the case, the reality is that you\u2019ll need to make more money, there\u2019s no way around it. \n\nFourth\u2026.If you think you don\u2019t have enough time to make more money, then you really need to audit how productive you are during the day. In most cases, you\u2019re wasting time somewhere\u2026\n\nFifth\u2026you need to save and invest consistently. This isn\u2019t meant to be something you do for a few months or a year and then stop. Ideally this is something you can do long term and turn into a lifestyle. \n\nSixth\u2026don\u2019t get trapped with lifestyle inflation. If you get a raise or make more money, SAVE THE DIFFERENCE. You can live exactly as you have been, except NOW you can accelerate your path to financial independence. \n\nSo with that said, that was how I was able to save 100% of my income for the last several years - and why I continue to pretty much save 100% of my income for the very long foreseeable future. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-07T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to save money","personal finance tips","how to save money as a teenager","how to save money for a house","how to save money for college","personal finance 101","personal finance for dummies","personal finance basics","financial independence","financial education","financial freedom","financial independence retire early","how i became a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","millionaire lifestyle","dave ramsey","how i save 100 of my income","how i save 100"],"title":"How I Save 100% Of My Income","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Rn-Vt1EZT0s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Rn-Vt1EZT0s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Rn-Vt1EZT0s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Rn-Vt1EZT0s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Rn-Vt1EZT0s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M14S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1586","dislikeCount":"182","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10764","viewCount":"198696"}},{"id":"HKxxfjRE2P0","snippet":{"description":"This is something I felt was very important to discuss for all the real estate agents out there, especially for all the newer agents out there who may be concerned about working in a real estate market some markets begins to soften - enjoy.

When I started, I had EVERYTHING working against me. I started working as a real estate agent in mid 2008\u2026literally right as the market had peaked and was falling in price. Couple that with the fact that I was 18, with no college degree, and zero experience in the business. However, what one person might see as a massive disadvantage, another might see as an opportunity. And the amazing part about this? Is that BOTH sides are right. The person who sees the disadvantages tends to focus on the disadvantages, and that\u2019s what they end up getting. The person who focuses on opportunity, are most likely to get those opportunities simply because it becomes a self fulfilling property. \n\nWhen I started, I was seeing a lot of agents LEAVING THE BUSINESS.  Oddly enough, this was one of the main reasons I feel I did so well\u2026as the market shifted, agents left\u2026and I was just getting started. But the real reason I was able to build up a business that now does over $20,000,000 a year in sales volume was because of what I did in the beginning of my career, and now is something that you should triple down on\u2026and that is LEASES. \n\nI want to say that 90-95% of agents won\u2019t do this. If they DO do this, they\u2019re simply doing a favor to keep their client happy, when deep down they know they really don\u2019t want to do it. But this is where I saw an opportunity and I excelled\u2026it was getting really, really good at leasing, during a time when VERY few properties were selling. Tenants were EVERYWHERE, agents were leaving the business, no one wanted to work leases\u2026and here I was, hungry to do ANYTHING I could, who basically had an all the lease clients I wanted.\n\nLeases clients are very simple to get. Very few people want to work with them, very few people are GOOD at working with them, and they largely go ignored. Because the higher end price points were so competitive, I had to get \u201cin\u201d with these people somehow\u2026so I mainly worked lease clients. I\u2019d find them a place and keep in touch\u2026they\u2019d refer me some other business, I\u2019d work with them and lease them a place.\n\nAround 2012, about 4 years into my career doing this\u2026and those lease clients began coming back to me to BUY. All of a sudden, that $1620 commission I earned early on was worth $35,000 4 years later. And then it happened again\u2026more lease clients came to me to BUY. After all, I worked 24\/7 for them, I kept in touch with them, I became a friend to them..of course they would use me to buy. This is what led to $125 million worth of sales\u2026almost all came from leases. \n\nSo right now, for you\u2026if the market goes down or goes through a down turn, NOW is not the time to get discouraged and quit\u2026instead, this is what you\u2019ve been waiting for, this is your opportunity to DOUBLE DOWN when most agents simply can\u2019t stay in the business.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-05T21:00:00Z","tags":["real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","real estate agent career","real estate agent training","the real estate agent academy","real estate agent tips","real estate agent salary","how to be a real estate agent","how to get your real estate license","real estate agent 101","real estate broker","bryan casella","tom ferry","mike ferry","grant cardone","real estate explained","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing strategies 2018","real estate agent 2018"],"title":"How I earned over $3 Million as a Real Estate Agent","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HKxxfjRE2P0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HKxxfjRE2P0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HKxxfjRE2P0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HKxxfjRE2P0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HKxxfjRE2P0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"516","dislikeCount":"33","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2141","viewCount":"48885"}},{"id":"E_5br58sqYU","snippet":{"description":"I thought we\u2019ve seen it all\u2026.but no, we may have just regressed slightly as a human race, because now\u2026people are spending upwards of $200,000 to own a piece of 1100 square foot, virtual, digitalized real estate in the game Decentraland.

This is a virtual reality world where you can purchase land through the Ethereum blockchain, and have full control over the content of that land that you own. You then have the ability to keep all proceeds from the value that you generate from other users because of the land that you own. \n\nDespite common sense, that isn\u2019t stopping people from spending considerable amounts of money buying and developing virtual land, and so far that\u2019s proved rather profitable for those that got in early. Known as Genesis City, only 90,000 plots of land will be sold. The most expensive plot of land sold, so far, for $200,000, near its Central Plaza, where people first arrive when they enter the game\u2026and guess what, the previous owner only bought that land for only $13,000.\n\nNow this isn\u2019t the first time people are paying exorbitant amounts of money for virtual items, practically all video games now go with the freemium business model by offering the game for free, and once you\u2019re already enjoying the experience, you can pay for upgrades and other features. It\u2019s a really, really smart business move that\u2019s taken over gaming and the way creators are building apps\u2026but how far is too far?\n\nHere\u2019s the problem I see - on one hand, we have the utility value of what something is worth. In a game like Decentraland, this could be how many daily active users there are, how much actual income your land generates in real, usable, currency, and the overall user growth of the game. From there, we can determine what an appropriate ROI is for the land and how that land can be monetized.  But where people get carried away is the \u201cGreater Fool\u201d perspective\u2026it\u2019s the thought process that I\u2019m willing to pay whatever price I need to buy something, because I believe someone else will be willing to pay more than I did. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, coming from both a business AND investment standpoint, with some common sense practicality mixed in for good measure, there\u2019s nothing inherently WRONG with buying something within a game - we\u2019ve all done it. If buying an item gives you an edge over someone else in terms of game play, it becomes an ADVANTAGE where that item increases your enjoyment within the game. At that point, you\u2019re simply paying for entertainment, just like you\u2019d pay for a movie or a night on the town, and that purchase has an actual, measurable utility value.\n\nSo from that perspective, it\u2019s all good - but how about as an investment? Here we go down the rabbit hole. We\u2019ve seen this time and time again\u2026if there is ZERO utility value, it will eventually fail. In order for something to be a viable long term investment, it needs to have a utility value - if it doesn\u2019t, at best, it\u2019s a speculative gamble. This carries over to ANYTHING you invest in.\n\nSo what\u2019s my prediction on Decentraland? I think it\u2019s a generic concept with the potential to be easily copied over and over again within different games. There\u2019s nothing really unique about it, and because of that, there\u2019s no reason why this would be more valuable than any other game out there. If they actually manage to get so big as to compete with Runescape or Minecraft, investors have a chance at really making some serious money - but that also ties back into the game having a utility function and providing more of a service than appealing to investors who want their piece of easy, quick money. The sad reality is that if investors are driving the market, not real, actual users\u2026its destined to fail. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-09-01T16:00:01Z","tags":["virtual real estate","decentraland","decentraland mana","online real estate","virtual real estate investment","real estate investing","investing in real estate","real estate investing strategies","real estate 101","real estate investing for beginners","how to make money online","how to make passive income online","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 2018","decentraland real estate","decentraland gameplay","passive income strategies","passive income ideas"],"title":"I found the WORST thing money can buy: Virtual Real Estate for $200,000","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E_5br58sqYU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E_5br58sqYU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E_5br58sqYU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E_5br58sqYU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/E_5br58sqYU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"479","dislikeCount":"48","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1224","viewCount":"24291"}},{"id":"qabbIszlmzg","snippet":{"description":"It\u2019s inevitable\u2026we\u2019re going to see a recession SOMETIME in the future.

Now this is something you should do REGARDLESS of the market conditions\u2026in a great economy, pay down high interest debt. In a recession, DEFINITELY pay down high interest debt. The LAST thing you need is high interest debt bogging you down.\n\nNUMBER TWO: Pay down variable rate debt! Any time you have variable rate debt, you\u2019re really at the mercy of the FED\u2026throughout the last few years, variable rates have been incredibly favorable given we\u2019ve been in negative interest territory\u2026but as rates go up, it\u2019s going to begin costing you a LOT more money. \n\nNUMBER THREE: Keep 4-12 months of living expenses saved in cash. This one is huge\u2026keep money sitting on the sidelines in a high interest savings account that you don\u2019t touch. \n\nNUMBER FOUR: Keep your spending to a minimum. This means don\u2019t get used to a lifestyle where it\u2019s completely reliant on a strong economy, and if the markets go down, it\u2019s unsustainable. \n\nNUMBER FIVE: DON\u2019T over extend yourself! Don\u2019t take on more debt than you\u2019re comfortable with paying\u2026Buy things you can afford to own out right, and only finance real estate on fundamentals with a long term outlook!\n\nNUMBER SIX: Don\u2019t rely on only ONE source of income! This is simply too risky in the event you lose your job and all of a sudden you find yourself with no more money coming in, and then you\u2019re frantically trying to take anything you can because you need to pay the bills. \n\nNUMBER SEVEN: KEEP SAVING! You should try to keep your savings rate consistent whether we\u2019re in a great market, or a bad recession\u2026if we\u2019re in a great market, that\u2019s awesome because that should allow you more room to save and invest.

To put that in perspective, you are 4 times more likely to be hit by an asteroid, and 431 times MORE likely to get struck by lightning than win the lottery. But that can\u2019t stop us from dreaming, right?\n\nNow in order to understand what to do with this huge windfall, it\u2019s first important to recognize why so many lottery winners go broke. It\u2019s estimated that a THIRD of all lottery winners declare bankruptcy, and 70% lose all of it within just a few years. I discovered that type of person most likely to play the lottery in the first place had very little financial education and very little savings\u2026hence, why they\u2019re playing the lottery. It\u2019s estimated that 40% of lottery ticket purchasers in California were unemployed. \n\nThen, you combine that with ALL of your friends and family then asking for handouts, risky investments, extravagant purchases, and it\u2019s easy to see how winning the lottery could become so stressful. So what can someone do to potentially AVOID these issues?\n\nFIRST thing you should do IS TELL NO ONE. \n\nSECOND: Get an attorney. Many lottery winners chose to set up a blind trust, within a trust, to remain as anonymous as they can when they claim their prize. \n\nTHIRD: Take the lump sum. When you look at the money invested over the long term, you\u2019ll almost ALWAYS come out ahead after 29 years by taking the lump sum and investing it, than by getting the annuity.\n\nFOURTH: How to invest it? Assuming you took the lump sum of $1.6 billion dollars, you should be left with $900,000,000, and $450,000,000 net after taxes. Now if this were ME, here\u2019s how I\u2019d distribute this:\n\n$150,000,000 in a low-fee Total Stock Market Index Fund by Vanguard. Assuming you spend just 3% of this amount annually, that should give you about $375,000 per month in income without ever touching the principle. \n\n$150,000,000 in a low-fee Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund with Vanguard. This would give you a very safe, stable investment that you can rely on. It would also give us another $375,000 PER MONTH in stable income. \n\n$50,000,000 and spread that throughout some safe, triple-net commercial real estate in highly dense cities. Lets assume you only spent 3% of this income annually, that gives you another $125,000 PER MONTH in income.\n\n$100,000,000 and spread that throughout some safe RESIDENTIAL real estate, mainly large apartment buildings in densely populated cities. This is another $125,000 PER MONTH in income.  \n\n$50,000,000 is the amount you now have over. I\u2019d personally decide to keep $10,000,000 as a cash buffer, and then spend the remaining $40,000,000 on whatever you see fit. At the same time, your investments will also bring in a total of $1,000,000 PER MONTH pretty much indefinitely without ever touching the principle. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-22T22:30:01Z","tags":["mega millions","lottery","lottery record","billion dollar lottery","lottery winner","powerball drawing","mega millions drawing","how to win the lottery","record jackpot","how to invest","how to invest a million dollars","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","stock market investing","vanguard index fund","passive income","why do lottery winners end up broke","passive income ideas","real estate investing 101","stock market 101","real estate 101"],"title":"How to Invest $1.6 BILLION DOLLARS if you win the Mega Millions Lottery","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKqnts_q-Ls\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKqnts_q-Ls\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKqnts_q-Ls\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKqnts_q-Ls\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AKqnts_q-Ls\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M19S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1704","dislikeCount":"286","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13229","viewCount":"223538"}},{"id":"oYJaLgJL0Ok","snippet":{"description":"We\u2019ve got Jeremy from Financial Education YouTube Channel answering the questions about How to Invest in Stocks for Beginners in 2019, enjoy!

Now the reasons WHY the FED raised rates seems fairly logical to me - for the last few years, interest rates were pretty much in NEGATIVE territory, meaning they\u2019re losing money just by loaning out money. \n\nFirst, cheap rates are meant to help the economy. Lowering interest rates made money cheaper to borrow, which meant more money could flow freely through the economy through cheap lending, and that in turn, meant more money in our pockets, which means more money we can spend. This works in the short term, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing this for a little while\u2026but eventually we battle fears of inflation, which means our money, over time, continues to have less and less purchasing power. \n\nSecondly, interest rates are only raised in a healthy economy. It\u2019s these types of markets that can handle a rate increase like we\u2019ve seen.\n\nThird, the new tax plan caused businesses and individuals to keep a LOT more money, and by doing so, it became that much more profitable. In return, stock prices soared knowing that companies would have a lot more profit at the end of the day. \n\nSo lets talk about how this specifically relates to real estate. \n\nFirst point, inflation\u2026from a real estate person\u2019s perspective, we LOVE inflation. This is because the value of your asset or property generally goes UP, while the amount of debt you have stays the exact same and the AMOUNT of that debt actually goes down. But this is bad for everything else. \n\nSecond point, the higher the interest rate, the more expensive it becomes to own real estate or borrow money. \n\nThird point, I should break down into three thoughts:\nPeople can\u2019t bid as aggressively as they once were able to.\nSecond, over the last year, many of the buyers were buying because they had a sense of urgency to lock in an interest rate before they went up.\nThird, we\u2019ll continue to see a lack of inventory which will keep prices from falling too dramatically. Most people who bought real estate did so with a significant amount of money down, with great credit, and sufficient income\u2026the variable here is that most of these people took out an interest rate much lower than they\u2019d pay now, and because of that, if they sold, they\u2019d give up a historically low mortgage.\n\nThis leads me to think that a few things are likely to happen. Mainly that this is a GOOD thing for landlords and the rental market. I think we\u2019ll see a lot of buyers sitting on the sidelines just waiting to see what happens and if affordability gets better. I think we\u2019ll get a bigger selection of tenants from the buyers that aren\u2019t buying. \n\nI think we may also see more landlords deciding to RENT their homes out instead of sell. This means we\u2019ll continue to see less inventory on the market, as selling just doesn\u2019t make sense for people with 30-year mortgages. \n\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-17T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 2019","real estate investing for dummies","real estate investing explained","real estate prediction","real estate 2019","real estate agent","how to buy real estate","how to invest in real estate","how to invest","how to invest 2019","mortgage rates","real estate interest rates","real estate agent 101","real estate mentor","real estate investing strategies"],"title":"Bad News For Real Estate...?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Pk-Kiufd7V0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Pk-Kiufd7V0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Pk-Kiufd7V0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Pk-Kiufd7V0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Pk-Kiufd7V0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"438","dislikeCount":"66","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1377","viewCount":"38691"}},{"id":"HCTlJH8e-IQ","snippet":{"description":"As highly requested, here\u2019s a step by step tutorial showing you a way that you can make some decent side money, at any age, with nearly ZERO experience, and best of all\u2026it\u2019s ZERO risk.

Many banks hold on to their old currency, so you can \u201cbuy\u201d them at face value and resell them for a profit online. \n\nThe FIRST thing you need to make sure is that the currency is OLDER than 1990. If it\u2019s newer than this, it generally doesn\u2019t have much of a premium, and it\u2019s not worth your time. My FAVORITE years, if you can find them, are between 1929-1950. \n\nThe SECOND thing you want to find is what\u2019s called a \u201cStar Note.\u201d You can tell it\u2019s a star note when you look at the serial number, and you see a Star at the very end. This means that particular \u201crun\u201d of bill printing had an error in it, so governments replace that batch of bills with a \u201cstar\u201d serial number to keep track of how many bills have been printed. These make the money worth a LOT more. \n\nThe THIRD thing you need to look at is the bill\u2019s condition. Condition is absolutely everything, and need to learn what to try to avoid. Generally speaking, the newer the bill is, the better the condition it needs to be for you to make a profit.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about what you\u2019re looking at, or if you don\u2019t know how to value it, my recommendation is just to buy it at face value - then look on eBay to determine value. Compare similar condition, compare same year, and compare where the bill is from. You can use PaperMoneyGuide.com to get rough estimates of values. If it\u2019s a star note, you can use MyCurrencyCollection.com to look up the serial number and see how many star notes were produced. Rare production runs of starnotes often mean it can be worth sometimes triple or quadruple the face value. \n\nSo now lets talk about fees when using eBay, and this is something you ABSOLUTELY need to consider because this gets expensive. Because eBay and PayPal take payment based on a percentage of the total sale, your $100 bill is immediately worth less if you simply sell it for $100. \n\neBay will take a flat 10% of the selling price unless you have an eBay store. If you have an eBay store, it\u2019s more like 6.15%, or 5.5% if you\u2019re a top rated seller. But lets just assume you don\u2019t have a store and you pay 10%. That means from $100, you\u2019re left with $90. Then you have PayPal fees\u2026that\u2019s another 2.9% on $100. So now you\u2019re down to basically $87. \n\nThen you have shipping. If you pass this on to buyer, I highly recommend priority shipping, preferably with tracking signature delivery so you have proof of arrival. This costs anywhere from $4-$5.50 or so. If the buyer pays for this, great\u2026if you pay for this, you\u2019ll need to add this in. \n\nFinally, last thing, when it comes to shipping..it\u2019s very important to make sure your envelope doesn\u2019t bend. I\u2019ll cut out two pieces of cardboard and place the bills in between the cardboard, I\u2019ll tape the outside together, and place that into an envelope. \n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Like I said, this isn\u2019t something you\u2019ll be raking in a ton of money from, but small $20-$100 profits per sale really add up when you start selling 3-5 at a time. And again, WORST case is that if the bill doesn\u2019t sell, you just go and deposit it back in the bank and get something else. That\u2019s it. If it sells, you make money, great!\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-15T22:30:01Z","tags":["flipping money","how to flip money","how to make 100 a day","how to make 100","how to make 1000","how to make 100 dollars a day","how to make 100 dollars fast","how to make 100 dollars as a kid","how to make 100 dollars a day as a kid fast","how to make 100 a day as a teenager","how to make money","how to make money without experience","how to make money as a teenager","how to make 1000 in a day","flipping old money","how to make money 101","old currency value","flipping items"],"title":"How to make RISK FREE PROFIT at any age by Flipping Money (Step By Step)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HCTlJH8e-IQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HCTlJH8e-IQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HCTlJH8e-IQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HCTlJH8e-IQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HCTlJH8e-IQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M11S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"607","dislikeCount":"256","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6740","viewCount":"108975"}},{"id":"snTgTQndvi0","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about the reality of Rent Control, the economics behind it, and why it\u2019s ultimately a flawed approach to a housing shortage - enjoy!

A 1992 pole of the American Economic Association found that 93% of its members agreed that \u201ca ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing.\u201d \n\nA Stanford study has argued that Rent Control actually has an ADVERSE affect on prices for renters and actually works AGAINST making housing more affordable.\nHere\u2019s what they found:\n-Rent controlled tenants were 20% more likely to stay in their unit.\n-Renters were more likely to move elsewhere if they didn\u2019t have the incentive of having their rent capped where they currently were living\n-In the priciest neighborhoods, turnover was HIGHEST as landlords actively try to remove tenants to achieve market rents\n-Landlords of rent controlled buildings were more likely to convert their buildings in such a way that it wasn\u2019t rent controlled, reducing the amount of housing by 15%\n-The loss of available housing drove up prices of rental units. It was found that a 6% decrease in housing supply led to a 7% increase in rental prices. \n\nThe net result is that, based off these studies, rent control ends up restricting the supply of new units into the market. While some renters may get a bargain and win the lease-agreement lottery, most people NEVER get access to low rent-controlled prices, and if they do, they are incentivized to never move out because it\u2019s so cheap, lowering supply.\n\nFirst, landlords of rent controlled properties have NO INCENTIVE to fix up their units. If they have a tenant paying below market rent, they want the tenant out. Because of that, they will do the bare minimum to keep the unit habitable and nothing else, hoping that eventually the tenant will get fed up and leave\u2026allowing the landlord to re-rent the unit for market prices. Generally, rent controlled units are falling apart. Landlords do NOT take care of them as they should.\n\nSecond, when it comes to owning real estate, it\u2019s a business\u2026and any sustainable business out there is driven by money. Landlords will spend whatever it takes to increase the value fo their property if it means they\u2019ll receive a higher rent.\n\nThird, my personal experience is that rent control doesn\u2019t always benefit the person it was intended for - it benefits the person who happened to sign a lease agreement at the right time, regardless of how much money they make or whether or not they actually NEED the assistance.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex situation, and there isn\u2019t necessarily a one-size-fits-all approach that will make EVERYONE happy, but here\u2019s my thoughts.\n\nIn order for a solution to work, we need to place our focus NOT on rent control, but expanding zoning so that we can build more dense housing. Until then, the problem will continue to get worse\u2026and if rent controls are enacted even further, landlords will be less likely to maintain their properties, more likely to take their units off the market, more likely to convert them to units that aren\u2019t rent controlled, and all of this will further drive up housing costs as inventory dwindles. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-12T22:30:00Z","tags":["rent control","prop 10 california 2018","proposition 10","rent control economics","real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing explained","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2019","real estate investing 101","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","real estate agent 101","passive income","passive income 2019","passive income real estate"],"title":"exposing the dark side of rent control...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/snTgTQndvi0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/snTgTQndvi0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/snTgTQndvi0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/snTgTQndvi0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/snTgTQndvi0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M53S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"749","dislikeCount":"145","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"3923","viewCount":"83373"}},{"id":"S0YoBC10q0o","snippet":{"description":"FULL DAY LIVE REAL ESTATE INVESTING EVENT AT MY NEW PROPERTY OCTOBER 27TH: https:\/\/goo.gl\/QfeS1F\n\nFor those of you that know, I\u2019ve been looking to buy more real estate here in Los Angeles. I recently found something and after a few weeks, I got my offer accepted. Here\u2019s how! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nHere\u2019s the video summed up for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to watch the whole thing\u2026but at least hit that LIKE button ;) \n\nI saw a property I really liked, and made an offer. They ended up getting several offers, and asked for a best and final. I made that offer at what the property was fundamentally worth, based on all the sold comparable and similar homes on the market. Unfortunately, other people were willing to over pay WAY more than what it was worth, and my offer was denied. However, later they came back to me when their higher offers fell through. I have a feeling the previous buyers regretted paying what they did, and felt it was best to back out. \n\nNow that I\u2019m back in the picture, I made another offer at exactly what I felt the home was worth, given the square footage, size, condition, and other sold properties. However, again - that offer was rejected, even though I felt it was a very good offer for what I was offering. \n\nAfter over a week of going back and forth, I stayed firm and eventually my offer was accepted - here\u2019s what I did, why I bought this specific property, and how I can add value over time! \n\nLesson here: If you know what a property is worth, don\u2019t over pay. Stick to your price. It\u2019s a logical decision to move forward or not, and if you feel something is worth what you\u2019re paying, don\u2019t pay more. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-10T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing strategies 2019","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing for beginners","passive income real estate","passive income ideas","passive income 2019","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","how i became a millionaire","millionaire real estate","investing in rental property","investing for beginnners"],"title":"SELLER ACCEPTED MY OFFER - BUYING MY 6TH PROPERTY!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S0YoBC10q0o\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S0YoBC10q0o\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S0YoBC10q0o\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S0YoBC10q0o\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S0YoBC10q0o\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"578","dislikeCount":"27","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1457","viewCount":"29287"}},{"id":"8Y8XSmKqXhQ","snippet":{"description":"Even though I consider myself a huge fan of Gary Vaynerchuk and love his overall message, there\u2019s one portion of his advice that I\u2019ve found hasn\u2019t worked well with me - and this is what it is. Enjoy. Feel free to add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan \n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 off for a LIMITED TIME with code ThankYou50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nHere\u2019s what that is: it\u2019s his mantra of put your head down, and work. Put in 15 hour days. Work weekends. You need to maximize every moment in order to achieve something big. And listen, I can only speak for myself here\u2026but I have to say, this advice isn\u2019t meant for everyone, and dare I say, this isn\u2019t the only way to achieve success. And hey, I acknowledge my own advice isn\u2019t for everyone, either, you have to find something that works for you, but my experience was that I became MISERABLE when I did nothing but work. \n\nI wasn\u2019t an interesting person. I literally didn\u2019t know who I was, I lost my personality, I lost what it was like to be \u201cme\u201d - because I was doing exactly what Gary encourages, and that is to put your head down, and work nonstop. I wanted to be so much more than just someone who worked over everything else, and it took 4 years to realize that just wasn\u2019t ME. And oddly enough, I found out that once I started focusing on ME more, cutting back on clients, and focusing only on the ones that were my biggest source of business,  I actually started making more money. I want those days to be totally unproductive, because I know these things refresh me to do even BETTER work for the hours where I dedicate to being productive. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong here, because I believe one of the main distinctions for Gary is that you can tell he ABSOLUTELY LOVES what he does - and I\u2019d venture to say, for him, it doesn\u2019t feel like work. This is him having a great time\u2026he could work 18 hour days for a month and be absolutely thrilled. \n\nBut I also recognize the unsustainability of keeping that up long term\u2026You also run into the problem that at the end of the day, you can only PHYSICALLY WORK SO MUCH until you can\u2019t work anymore. There are only 24 hours in a day\u2026what this cycle reinforces is that the amount of time you work is directly correlated with your success, and every hour \u201cextra\u201d is one hour of further advancement. When you\u2019re working this much, there becomes a limit to what you can physically be capable of before you NEED to focus on increasing productivity, not time. \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t have the pressure just to work, work, work, hustle, work\u2026without understanding that that behavior, at some point, becomes detrimental to your success. AT SOME POINT, it\u2019ll hinder your ability to grow\u2026whether it be socially, or financially. And if you\u2019re perfectly happy working 18 hours a day and you don\u2019t see a problem with it, then ignore this video and I\u2019ll take the dislike. But I assure you, from my experience, I\u2019d much rather be more creative, more relaxed, less stressed, and less worked\u2026.than a million dollars wealthier, feeling overworked, stressed out, and guilty every time I wanted to take time off. I feel we should stress the importance that the amount of hours you work doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to the level of success you\u2019ll achieve.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-08T21:30:01Z","tags":["gary vaynerchuk","gary vaynerchuk motivation","gary vaynerchuk college","gary vaynerchuk breakfast club","gary vaynerchuk interview","gary vee hot ones","gary vee show","dailyvee","gary vaynerchuk hustle","entrepreneur","entrepreneur lifestyle","millionaire lifestyle","how i became a millionaire","garyvee","one life no regrets","The Ultimate Advice For Every 20 Year Old","what to do after college","tony robbins","anthony robbins gary vee","tony robins gary","grant cardone","tai lopez"],"title":"the problem with gary vaynerchuk","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Y8XSmKqXhQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Y8XSmKqXhQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Y8XSmKqXhQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Y8XSmKqXhQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Y8XSmKqXhQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4941","dislikeCount":"2742","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"36327","viewCount":"719074"}},{"id":"yPEqGFCNK3Q","snippet":{"description":"As highly requested, let\u2019s discuss how to make $100 per day as a beginner online in 2019 - and which two methods you might be able to implement for yourself, regardless of your experience level.

Prior to making YouTube videos, I\u2019ve NEVER made money online - it\u2019s only within the last year that I\u2019ve seen any substantial return. I spent DOZENS of hours every week making videos, planning them out, editing, responding to comments, learning the youtube algorithm\u2026and I made almost nothing. It took me months to begin making more than $1000 per month from ad revenue. Even longer to begin branching off into coaching, consulting, etc. and other residuals from YouTube. However, as a beginner, YouTube can be one of the greatest outlets you decide to do. While it won\u2019t happen overnight, you can branch off into just about anything\u2026affiliate marketing, merch sales, selling your own product, earning ad revenue, sponsors\u2026the sky is the limit. \n\nKevin\u2019s option would be a Facebook Ads Social Media Marketing Agency. This is where businesses pay you to do their social media, and you give them exposure by understanding how to target potential customers on Facebook.

Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 off for a LIMITED TIME with code ThankYou50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nWhat\u2019s the first cost you have to incur? INSPECTIONS. This is when you have the ability to inspect the property for any defects or needed repairs, and then decide if this is a deal you feel comfortable buying. Depending on the type of property and age of the home, a basic inspection can run you anywhere from $350 all the way up to $3000.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve done your inspection, you have to pay for your appraisal. Anytime you\u2019re getting a loan from the bank, they will require an appraisal that proves the home is actually worth what you\u2019re buying it for. Appraisals are usually done within a week after the seller accepts your offer, and usually runs anywhere from $400-$1000 for the most part depending how many units you\u2019re buying, or if it\u2019s just a single family home or condo. \n\nWhile we\u2019re on the topic of loans, the bank LOVES to charge you fees\u2026lots of fees. Many banks will charge about half a percent to upwards of 1% of the loan amount as their origination fee. This means on a $500,000 loan, you could potentially pay $2500-$5000 as a mortgage fee. \n\nNext, you have to make sure your insurance paid for by the time you close. \n\nAnd by now, this brings us into our \u201cEscrow\u201d Fees\u2026in some states you have \u201clawyers\u201d who handle the transaction, in California we have escrow companies. In California, they typically charge $2 for every $1000 of purchase price, plus sometimes a base fee in addition to that. So on a $500k dollar home, you\u2019re looking around $1000-$1500 plus whatever base fee they might have.\n\nThen you have TITLE FEES. A title company ensures that the deed to the property can be delivered free and clear of all encumbrances and liens\u2026basically, it means that you can take full ownership to the property without worrying that someone else is out there also claiming that they are the legal owner. I\u2019d say this ranges anywhere from $500-$1200 depending on the type of property, title company, and what\u2019s involved - again, there can be several factors that play into this. \n\nAnd then\u2026last but not least\u2026you have miscellaneous fees that can add up. A $250 notary fee. A $65 overnight messenger fee. A $30 audit fee, etc\u2026we can just chalk this up to an extra $500 in random, miscellaneous things.\n\nTOTAL: $6000-$13,982\n\nYou\u2019ll see now that we have a wide range of expenses\u2026here in California, I\u2019m assuming the typical $500,000 house. Obviously closing costs of nearly $14,000 IS EXTREMELY EXCESSIVE, but it really depends on so many factors and what type of companies you opt in for, whether it\u2019s single family or multi family, whether it\u2019s owner occupied or for investment, what insurance you get, and whether or not you can negotiate these rates with the companies. I\u2019d always recommend shopping around and negotiating to get the lower rate EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU BUY SOMETHING. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-10-03T22:30:00Z","tags":["Real estate investing","real estate investing 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategy","real estate investing with no money","real estate 101","biggerpockets","passive income","passive income real estate","passive income 101","passive income ideas","investing in real estate rentals","real estate investing for dummies","real estate investing grant cardone","how i became a millionaire","stock market investing","real estate millionaire"],"title":"The  HIDDEN COST of buying Real Estate\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cN7n3wC9eAQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cN7n3wC9eAQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cN7n3wC9eAQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cN7n3wC9eAQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cN7n3wC9eAQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"648","dislikeCount":"36","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6732","viewCount":"61589"}},{"id":"_NAgAUpN0pQ","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about How to Invest $100 in 2020, and the Five BEST Strategies for getting the highest ROI at any age - enjoy!

Your HIGHEST yielding investment with $100 is in education, hands down, by far, above anything else. Education will make you MILLIONS over your lifetime. If you want to know what books to buy, here\u2019s what I\u2019d go for:\n\n$11 - Think and Grow Rich: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2xIWP7D\n$15  - The Four Hour Work Week: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Qfa6M1\n$20 - The Book on Rental Property Investing: How to Create Wealth and Passive Income Through Intelligent Buy & Hold Real Estate Investing: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2IkyUiO\n$10 - How to win friends and influence people: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2QgVEDj\n$16 - The Little Book of Common Sense Investing: The Only Way to Guarantee Your Fair Share of Stock Market Returns (Little Books.

Sign up for RobinHood and GET A FREE STOCK: https:\/\/share.robinhood.com\/grahams106\n\nYou can use $100 and turn that into a firsthand, practical LIFE course on investing in the stock market that will last you a LIFETIME. You will get the real, first hand experience doing this firsthand and this will make a much more impactful impression than simply reading about it in a book. \n\nSo what\u2019s the best way to get started with this? Deposit $100 in a Robinhood account for free trading and open up an account - then begin doing research! Start watching YouTube videos on the stock market, start checking CNN money, CNBC, MotleyFool, NerdWallet, Reddit, learn how to read candlestick charts, earnings reports\u2026all of this is really available to you FREE online. \n\nNumber Three..FLIPPING ITEMS! There\u2019s been some really cool YouTube video challenges lately about people flipping items from Craigslist or from items they\u2019ve bought from yard sales. If you want a fun, creative way to invest your $100\u2026buy items and flip them on craigslist or eBay! \n\nNumber Four\u2026Affiliate Marketing. This is when you\u2019re going to promote another product and you get paid a small percentage when someone buys that product. You can get affiliate commissions from just about EVERYTHING out there. $100 is more than enough to get yourself something that records video if you want to make YouTube videos. It\u2019s enough to pay for a template website. It\u2019s enough to get yourself started if you want to begin promoting other peoples products\u2026\n\nFinally, and this is a bit off topic but I thought this is a fun example\u2026spend your $100 on a used lawnmower. Go to your neighbors and offer to mow their lawns for $20 each. Within a day, you could potentially have made all your money back. Continue doing that. All of a sudden, you could build up a rather cool side gig that will consistently bring you money each week\u2026and you get some exercise at the same time. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2018-10-01T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest 100","how to invest 100 in 2019","how to invest 100 best way","best way to invest 100","how to invest 100 in the stock market","how to invest 100 dollars","how to invest 100 dollars in robinhood","how to invest 100 dollars online","how to invest 1000 dollars","how to invest 10000 dollars","best way to invest","how to invest in stocks","stock market 101","stock market investing explained","stock market investing for beginners","stock market strategies","ryan scribner"],"title":"HOW TO INVEST $100 IN 2020 (THE 5 BEST WAYS)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NAgAUpN0pQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NAgAUpN0pQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NAgAUpN0pQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NAgAUpN0pQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NAgAUpN0pQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3445","dislikeCount":"1454","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"48855","viewCount":"854591"}},{"id":"57TtF5ggH9c","snippet":{"description":"These are the Top 5 WORST Money Mistakes people make in their 20\u2019s, and how to avoid them - enjoy!

A recent study determined that the average student loan amount for the class of 2016 was $37,172. Even worse, it\u2019s forecasted that the total outstanding student loan balance will reach 2 TRILLION DOLLARS by 2022. Absolutely re-consider if college is the right choice and if you need a degree for what you want to do. If so, consider a community college for 2 years to save the money, then transfer. It makes no difference (except to your bank account. \n\n2. Waiting to invest. One of the BIGGEST advantages that you have in your 20\u2019s is TIME. Not only can you ride out any short term fluctuations in the market, but you can fully take advantage of what\u2019s called COMPOUND INTEREST. This is why the money you SAVE and INVEST in your 20\u2019s is arguably the most IMPORTANT money you have your entire life. You can basically get 40 years for your investments to grow into something massive, simply because you have time on your side, working in your favor. \n\n3. Buying an expensive car. Assuming you\u2019re just a car enthusiast and want a fun car to drive, there\u2019s nothing wrong with buying a nice car in your 20\u2019s\u2026just make sure you can afford it. Ideally, less than 10% of your take home salary should go to a car payment\u2026this means just get a Miata or S2000 instead of a Porsche 911. Take the budget route until you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s. \n\n4. Renting an expensive apartment. Renting a place is awesome, especially if this enables to you to save and invest elsewhere. And you should also live somewhere you\u2019re happy with. But throwing a TON of money at a cool apartment in your 20\u2019s is a waste. An expensive apartment in your 20\u2019s is simply going to take away from the lifestyle you can live when it DOES matter\u2026it\u2019ll take away from future financial security, from future investments, and from future retirement. The more money you can save here, the more money you can have elsewhere. \n\n5. Not keeping track of your finances. Very few people actually do this, but it will make a massive difference. To do this, just sign up on Mint.com or PersonalCapital.com - it\u2019ll automatically track your spending. From there, you can reasonably start a budget, track your finances, and then cut back or save as needed. If you do this, you\u2019re going to be ahead of 99% of the population\u2026and it doesn\u2019t take much time to do this. Maybe 10 minutes a week, if that\u2026this is really, really simple stuff.

A year ago, it had just broken $10,000 with no end in sight. Less than two weeks after that, it was nearing $17,000. And on Sunday, December 17th, it reached the price of just over $20,000\u2026then the selloff began. Large investors began taking massive profits, the price of Bitcoin began falling back down to $13,000 as people continued selling off\u2026and that\u2019s when we saw problems. Here\u2019s what I think.\n\nFirst, the prices we saw a year ago were NEVER a real indication of what it was actually worth. Just because it was selling for $18,000 never meant it was actually worth $18,000\u2026for all we know, it could\u2019ve always been worth $2000 and a frenzy of enthusiasm and speculation drove it up WAY beyond what was ever sustainable. So I feel it\u2019s more likely that Bitcoin is returning to what it should actually be worth this entire time, than that it\u2019s losing value\u2026because that value was never there to begin with, if that makes sense. \n\nSecond, in terms of Bitcoin\u2019s recent drop, we have a somewhat recent investigation into Bitfinex, a cryptocurrency exchange which MAY have manipulated bitcoin prices in its favor. Regardless, it\u2019s pretty evident that cryptocurrency prices are HEAVILY influenced by positive OR negative press. In this case, just about ANY negative press means lower prices.\n\nThird\u2026and this might be unpopular opinion, but people are impatient. I think it\u2019s safe to say that not all, but a LOT of people buy Bitcoin to make money\u2026not use it day to day with their purchases. Given that, after a period of relative stability over 5 months, if you haven\u2019t made a profit, you\u2019re likely to sell. And that\u2019s what I believe a lot of people have been doing. \n\nCombine those factors together, and it makes sense that we\u2019ve seen prices continue to drop. But at the same time, ANY price predictions for cryptocurrency is LITERALLY just a guess. I\u2019m taking the stance that it is IMPOSSIBLE to predict what this is worth, other than saying it\u2019s worth what someone is willing to pay. \n\nI will say this, however\u2026it\u2019s going to take awhile to restore the confidence in Bitcoin before we see an upward turn in prices. \n\nDon\u2019t hold longer than you need to because of sunk cost fallacy making you believe it\u2019s better than it really is. See every investment as though it were an investment in TODAY\u2019S PRICES, not as something where you don\u2019t lose until you sell. You\u2019ve lost, on paper, and only time will tell is that plays out in your favor or not. And that\u2019s the risk you take anytime you invest, especially if you invest on speculation without fundamentals to back it up.\n\nSo that\u2019s all I have to say on that\u2026I\u2019m going back into Cryptocurrency retirement again for another 7 months. Enjoy. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how much YouTuber\u2019s make, and how much I made from a viral video\u2026chances are, it\u2019s higher than you expect it is. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-11-28T23:30:01Z","tags":["bitcoin","cryptocurrency","bitcoin 2019","bitcoin 2018","bitcoin price prediction","what happened to bitcoin","bitcoin news","bitcoin explained","bitcoin ricegum","cryptocurrency explained","bitcoin price drop","crypto explained","crypto mining","bitcoin investing","crypto investing","bitcoin investing for beginners","crypto investing for beginners","beatthebush","ethereum","litecoin","bitcoin cash","how to invest in bitcoin"],"title":"What happened to Bitcoin...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CZYmrKwzqR0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CZYmrKwzqR0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CZYmrKwzqR0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CZYmrKwzqR0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CZYmrKwzqR0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M29S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1118","dislikeCount":"147","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"2634","viewCount":"53339"}},{"id":"KT9ALlvND8U","snippet":{"description":"These are the TOP 5 BEST Credit Cards if you want free stuff, free travel, free perks..and exactly what to do.

If you get a 30 year loan, you can pay it off whenever you want. If you decide you want to pay it off in 15 years, just increase your monthly payment and pay it off sooner. \n\nWhat a 30 year loan gives you that a 15-year loan doesn\u2019t is FLEXIBILITY. It gives you the ability, if you want to, to pay it off over 30 years and invest elsewhere\u2026or you can pay it off in 5 years, it doesn\u2019t matter. The advantage to doing this is that it gives you more safety and leeway with your payments.\n\nAlso, home equity isn\u2019t really going to be making you money\u2026as unpopular as that is to say, when you have your money tied up in a property, it\u2019s not money that\u2019s easily accessible to invest elsewhere at a higher return. In order to get that money, you either need to sell the property - or do a cash-out refinance, pulling out your money, but then taking out a brand new loan and starting all of this again. \n\nWith a 30 year loan, you\u2019ll have access to your money as you need it because you\u2019re paying LESS money into an illiquid investment like real estate, and like my last example, you\u2019ll have more free cashflow available to you at the end of the month. \n\nAnd arguably, the difference in loan amounts between 15 years and 30 years is really such a small number after you account for write offs and inflation\u2026that you may as well just take the 30 year for additional flexibility, allowing you to re-invest the money at a higher return.\n\nAnd let me just say this for all the Dave Ramsey followers who live by his advice of the 15 year mortgage:\nThe IDEAL scenario here is that if you\u2019re getting a home for yourself to live in, buy something where you could afford the 15-year mortgage, but take a 30 year for additional flexibility. If you\u2019re getting a house where you can ONLY afford a 30 year house payment, I\u2019d argue that you should lower your price range.\n\nFor an investment property, always take the 30 year\u2026cash flow is king, not equity, so you could always go with the option that gives you the greatest amount of write offs\u2026which is the 30 year\u2026and the most cash flow\u2026which is also the 30 year.  \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-23T23:30:01Z","tags":["15 year mortgage vs 30","15 year mortgage","15 year mortgage dave ramsey","15 year mortgage vs 30 extra payments","30 year mortgage vs 15 year mortgage","how to pay your mortgage early","how to pay your mortgage in 5 years","how to pay your mortgage","how to pay your mortgage with a credit card","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing strategies for beginners","real estate investing explained","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing 2019"],"title":"PSA: Why you SHOULDN\u2019T get a 15-year Mortgage","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BJ3xhjqk52A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BJ3xhjqk52A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BJ3xhjqk52A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BJ3xhjqk52A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BJ3xhjqk52A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M37S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6862","dislikeCount":"4144","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"81239","viewCount":"1381662"}},{"id":"aIzRGunriSs","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered how much YouTube pays for a 1 million view viral video?

I\u2019ve always been completely upfront with how much I make from each of my income sources, purely from the perspective of offering value and sharing what you could potentially make, as well. And most of this social media stuff is completely new to me, too, so we\u2019re all along for the same ride and I\u2019m figuring it out as I go along\u2026so my experiences and learning lessons are yours, too. I\u2019ve always found videos like this to be super inspirational, just to know this stuff if even possible. \n\nHere\u2019s how it works. YouTube ad revenue pays on what\u2019s called CPM\u2026cost per mile, which in this case, is how much you get paid per 1000 views. This means advertisers pay different rates for different channels and topics, and that means each channel has a different CPM. My channel has a very high CPM\u2026 This is why my particular ad revenue is often 10-20x higher than other channels. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal with social blade\u2026when it comes to counting subscribers and views, social blade is 100% accurate. It pulls the data directly from YouTube. But when it comes to income, there\u2019s just no way for it to estimate accurately. There are too many factors to take into consideration\u2026like what type of channel it is, how long the videos are, what the topics are about, how many ads are in the video, and what type of ads are playing. \n\nBut remember, too, that most you tubers don\u2019t just rely on ad revenue\u2026they\u2019ll end up making just as much money from sponsored videos, which could be anywhere from $500-$5000 per sponsored video, from merch, which could be anywhere from $3000-$300,000 per month depending on the channel, and from anything else they offer\u2026like a program or how-to course\u2026there are many, many ways that people can monetize and branch out in addition to ad revenue alone.\n\nAnd that\u2019s how much YouTuber\u2019s make, and how much I made from a viral video\u2026chances are, it\u2019s higher than you expect it is. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-21T23:30:01Z","tags":["youtube ad revenue","viral video","how to make money on youtube","how much do youtubers make","how to make a viral video","how do youtubers get paid","youtube ad revenue explained","youtube ad revenue calculator","how much do youtubers make per view","how much do you make on youtube","how much do small youtubers amke","how to make a viral video on youtube","how to make money online","how to make money online as a teenager","how to make money online fast"],"title":"I\u2019m SHOCKED at how much YouTube paid me for a VIRAL VIDEO...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aIzRGunriSs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aIzRGunriSs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aIzRGunriSs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aIzRGunriSs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aIzRGunriSs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M24S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3434","dislikeCount":"805","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16035","viewCount":"604821"}},{"id":"bJx7_1rWC6U","snippet":{"description":"How to invest in real estate: Here\u2019s exactly how you can buy your first rental property, step by step, and the process involved.

How to build your credit:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ukaWAjgkH9M&t=4s\n\nStep 2: Make sure you have your tax returns prepared. If you\u2019re self employed like me, a lender will ask for your last 2 years of tax returns and take the average income of those two years. Be ready for this!\n\nStep 3: TALK TO A LENDER FIRST BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING. First, you\u2019ll know EXACTLY what you can qualify for so you won\u2019t waste your time. Secondly, if you find the right place, the lender already has all of your information so you can hit the ground running. And anytime you find a spot that\u2019s worth buying, chances are, you\u2019re competing with other people who want the exact same thing. So timeliness really, really matters here\u2026the faster you are, the better the deal you can get. \n\nStep 4: BEGIN LOOKING AT PROPERTIES. This is really meant to be the fun part\u2026look at EVERYTHING you possibly can within your price range. \nHow to find a good deal: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9nHDT5XL4KY&t=36s\n\nStep 5: Determine cash flow. The reality is that 95% of properties just don\u2019t make sense to purchase for an investment\u2026they lose money. It\u2019s also the reality that at a certain price, EVERYTHING makes a great investment - it\u2019s really important to understand these numbers. \n\nThree ways to make money owning real estate: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h8wNUaBgZTk&t=19s\nMortgage Calculator: www.MortgageCalculator.org\n\nStep 6: Look at properties that need minor cosmetic renovations! \nMost profitable renovations: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kW76liexoBY&t=2s\nBiggest Mistakes: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Tof5GMD0akc&t=46s\n\n\nStep 7: MAKE OFFERS ON PROPERTIES! Expect that not every offer will work out\u2026for me, I lose out on many offers because I offer a price where the numbers make sense, and if it\u2019s any higher than that, I won\u2019t buy it. \n\nStep 8: Do your inspections! Make sure to do as many inspections as you possible can. Check the roof, the foundation, electrical, plumbing, if there are any leaks, bring in contractors for bids if it needs work\u2026the more you do, the better. \n\nStep 9: Understand escrow costs: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cN7n3wC9eAQ&t=64s\n\nStep 10: RENOVATE IT! Video on renovations: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iBOeQv7zzgI&t=175s\n\nStep 11: RENT IT OUT! If you want to rent your place for top dollar, use REALLY good pictures, pick up your phone on the second ring, and be available anytime to show it. I promise if you do this, you\u2019ll have no problem renting it out quickly. I personally like using Apartments.com, Craigslist, Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, and Reatltor.com\u2026the more places you property is, the better. Never just limit yourself to one of these, DO THEM ALL. \nTenant screening 101: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hS8lIrzEwv0&t=154s\n\nSTEP 12: SCALE UP! \n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-19T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to buy your first rental property","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate 2019","how to invest in real estate 101","investing in real estate","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 2019","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","real estate investing podcast","real estate investing audiobook","real estate agent","real estate mentor","real estate millionaire","how to invest in 2019"],"title":"How To Buy Your First Rental Property (Step by Step)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bJx7_1rWC6U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bJx7_1rWC6U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bJx7_1rWC6U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bJx7_1rWC6U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bJx7_1rWC6U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT27M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5968","dislikeCount":"1430","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"116395","viewCount":"2722982"}},{"id":"xnW_J6tXlb4","snippet":{"description":"In response to my previous video, Unboxing The $10 Million Dollar Invite-Only Credit Card: The JP Morgan Reserve, here is exactly why getting a credit card can be a responsible choice\u2026enjoy!

When it comes to credit cards, there\u2019s absolutely a RIGHT way to use them, and a WRONG way to use them\u2026\n\nThe right way to use a credit card is to have the money available in your checking account, use the credit card to purchase the item, and then pay off the entire bill in full because you have the money available. This gives you a few perks:\n\n1. First, you can do it for security. In the event someone takes your credit card and makes a purchase on it, most of the time credit card companies will reverse it, no questions asked. \n2. Second, you have purchase protection. With the Amex Platinum, if any of my items are lost or taken within the first 90 days of purchase, I\u2019m covered up to $10,000 PER OCCURRENCE. It also means that I get an EXTENDED WARRANTY. \n3. Third, you have Credit Card membership perks\u2026which would simply be too long to list here.\n\n\u201cWhy would you need a credit card if you have that much money\u201d\nAnswer: To get those sweet, sweet points. Check out this Billionaire who bought a $170,000,000 painting with Amex\u2026not because he couldn\u2019t afford it, obviously, but because he wanted the points. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about going and spending money you don\u2019t have, for points you don\u2019t need\u2026it\u2019s about learning how credit works, and then USING this to your advantage. For me, I spend $0 in interest. NOTHING. On every single credit card I\u2019ve ever had, I put every single purchase on the card and then PAY IT OFF IN FULL before it\u2019s due\u2026if you pay it back on time, in full, you pay no money to interest, and the credit card companies don\u2019t get a dollar. \n\nCredit is like playing with fire, you could either use the fire as a tool to keep you warm and cook your food, or you can burn yourself with it. Most people don\u2019t have the financial literacy to use credit cards responsibly, and THOSE people, unfortunately, are the ones that make credit cards profitable for the rest of us. Credit card companies WOULD NOT be throwing us insane perks like if it wasn\u2019t profitable\u2026however, I want to change that. And the only way to change that is by showing people how to use credit cards responsibly and change the mindset away from \u201ccredit cards are evil,\u201d to \u201ccredit cards are amazing WHEN USED RESPONSIBLY AND PAID OFF IN FULL WITH MONEY I HAVE IN MY BANK ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW INSTEAD OF PAYING IN CASH.\u201d It\u2019s really as simple as that. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-15T23:30:00Z","tags":["credit card","credit card churning","credit card 101","jp morgan","jp morgan palladium","jp morgan reserve card","jp morgan reserve credit card","how to increase your credit score","how to boost your credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","credit score to buy a house","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit card limit","how to increase your credit score in 30 days","dave ramsey","amex platinum","chase sapphire reserve","amex gold"],"title":"I\u2019m an IDIOT for getting a credit card...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xnW_J6tXlb4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xnW_J6tXlb4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xnW_J6tXlb4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xnW_J6tXlb4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xnW_J6tXlb4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M6S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4915","dislikeCount":"823","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"15417","viewCount":"316161"}},{"id":"4l9nmLfFQpM","snippet":{"description":"Unboxing the new invite-only JP Morgan Reserve Credit Card Card, formerly known as the JP Morgan Palladium Card - enjoy!

This places it as one of the most exclusive credit cards available. \n\nOriginally this card was branded as the JP Morgan Palladium Card, and..if you couldn\u2019t guess\u2026it was made out of Palladium. At current value, just the precious metal value of the card ALONE was worth $1000. However, when Chase launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve in 2016, JP Morgan Palladium Card Holders were a little upset\u2026the Chase Sapphire Reserve held ALL the benefits of the JP Morgan Palladium Card, for a fee of only $450\u2026and the Palladium Card\u2019s fee was $595. \n\nSo in 2017, JP Morgan discounted the Palladium Card, and simply rebranded it as the JP Morgan Reserve Card. Same thing, different name, and they lowered the annual fee to $450 to match the Chase Sapphire Reserve.\n\nOn the surface, the benefits of this card are nearly IDENTICAL to the Chase Sapphire Reserve. They\u2019re both a $450 annual fee, they both give you a $300 annual travel credit, they both get 3x points on travel and dining, they both give you complimentary lounge access\u2026I\u2019d say overall, these are the same cards. Except, I got this card for a few reasons:\n\n1. I had the opportunity to get it, so now I get bragging rights ;) \n2. I also get 60,000 points by signing up and spending $4000 in the first 3 months, which I was going to spend anyway, so I value that at approximately $1100 in free travel. \n3. I also can get the $300 travel credit in 2018, and then again beginning in 2019\u2026so that\u2019s another $600 in value\n\nHope you enjoy the unboxing! \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-07T23:30:00Z","tags":["JP Morgan Palladium","Palladium Card","JP Morgan Reserve card","jp morgan reserve card review","jp morgan reserve card unboxing","jp morgan palladium unboxing","jp morgan reserve vs amex platinum","chase sapphire reserve","american express platinum","american express gold","american express credit card","luxury credit card","elite credit card","credit card 101","how to improve your credit score","credit card churning","credit card points","Ask Sebby","ThePointsGuy","The Credit Shifu"],"title":"Unboxing The $10 Million Dollar Invite-Only Credit Card: The JP Morgan Reserve","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4l9nmLfFQpM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4l9nmLfFQpM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4l9nmLfFQpM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4l9nmLfFQpM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4l9nmLfFQpM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"9394","dislikeCount":"7786","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"58208","viewCount":"3270495"}},{"id":"N8VTQbRYxsk","snippet":{"description":"Inspired by Ryan Scribner\u2019s video, here\u2019s a breakdown of my 6 income sources, how and why I was able to build that up, and the timeless that led me to each of them - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nMy first, and currently largest income source is what I make working as a Real Estate Agent here in Los Angeles. This began in mid 2008, at a point where I was barely out of high school, had no college degree, I really had no marketable skill whatsoever, so I figured\u2026\u201dHey, I can just sell real estate!\u201d. If any of you watching haven\u2019t experienced a commission only sales job at some point in your life, I highly recommend it\u2026even if you never want to do sales ever again, I really believe the experience a commission-only environment provides is invaluable. \n\nMy second income source is by owning rental property. This was because my income was so inconsistent from selling real estate, that I wanted something I could rely on month-to-month. I now I own 6 properties, and the passive income generated by those properties is roughly $4750 per month. \n\nHowever, even though selling real estate and investing in real estate is fun and I really enjoyed it, I just felt like I wanted my own creative outlet to have fun, which led to my third income: YouTube ad revenue. In the beginning, I made pretty much anywhere from a few cents to make two dollars a day from ad revenue\u2026but once my first video took off out of nowhere, I had a single day make me about $170. YouTube Ad Revenue now generates an average of about $14,000 per month.\n\nBut with YouTube, just like any great YouTuber, it becomes a right of passage to introduce\u2026the course. To me, this was really about providing something additional to my YouTube videos\u2026Instead of spending my time teaching one person how to sell real estate, I could create a really, really detailed program that HUNDREDS of people could learn from instead. \n\nMy fourth income source is money from rents that directly pay down the mortgage in form of equity. When you have a mortgage, that payment is broken down into two categories: Principle and Interest. This means part of the rent pays down my loan balance, which means that over time, eventually the tenants pay for the property until I eventually own it outright. This is how I make an ADDITIONAL $2500 per month by paying down the loan balances.\n\nFinally, my 6th income source is probably the least exciting, but I\u2019ll occasionally do real estate consulting calls, and that generates about $1000 per month. I don\u2019t do them too often and it\u2019s really just on a case by case basis, but I do really enjoy doing them and talking with you guys, so I figured I\u2019d throw this in there. \n\nThe moral of this entire video is this: don\u2019t rely on only ONE source of income and learn to leverage your time to maximize what you can make. This is so powerful, and gives you the protection and flexibility to be able to divide your time as you see fit. Also, remember that this was NOT started overnight..this is something that took me YEARS to do. It took me about 6 months before I started really making any significant money on YouTube. It took me YEARS to scale up my rental income. It took me months to create my course. Don\u2019t get impatient, take your time, and see this as a long term outlook.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-05T23:30:00Z","tags":["PERSONAL FINANCE","personal finance 101","personal finance for dummies","my income sources","my passive income streams","personal finance basics","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income online","passive income for beginners","passive income 2019","how to make passive income","how i built 6 income sources","passive income streams","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing 101","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life"],"title":"How I built 6 Income Sources That Generate $59,750 Per Month","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N8VTQbRYxsk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N8VTQbRYxsk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N8VTQbRYxsk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N8VTQbRYxsk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N8VTQbRYxsk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M50S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2786","dislikeCount":"1373","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"36736","viewCount":"1277364"}},{"id":"-uERpelkNJo","snippet":{"description":"Introducing the Ultra FICO score coming in 2019. This is what it is, how this affects you, why you should care, and how this could increase your score and make you money\u2026enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 off for a LIMITED TIME with code ThankYou50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nSince the early 1990\u2019s, lenders have based about 90% of their decision on whether or not to extend you a line of credit based on the credit model: The FICO score. This is a score that calculates how many lines of credit you have open, how much of that you actually use, how long you\u2019ve had them open, and how often you\u2019ve paid them off on time. \n\nBut now that could change: introducing the Ultra FICO! The idea behind this is to allow lenders to extend credit to MORE borrowers by taking into account the borrow\u2019s history of cash transactions in their bank account. This new scoring method will consider how borrowers manage their checking, savings, and money market accounts\u2026it\u2019ll look at the average balance and whether or not the account has ever been withdrawn. \n\nLets FIRST start with the good things: \nUsed property, this could REALLY help out the people who have been caught in the credit card twilight zone of not having credit because they\u2019ve just never needed it. This NEW scoring method would give people like this the ability to potentially get a credit card, mortgage, or other loan because they have a history of otherwise properly managing their finances. Or maybe it\u2019s for the people who only have ONE credit card, have always paid it off on time, but they don\u2019t have ENOUGH credit to get them approved for a loan. This Ultra FICO model has the potential to extend credit to those who otherwise couldn\u2019t get it. \n\nHowever, I see THIS as a way for banks to begin loosing regulations and to expand the market to who they can lend money too. Many regulators have also expressed interest in exploring ways to increase access to affordable lending for consumers who have no or low credit scores. As I mentioned a previous video, I personally believe we\u2019re seeing the economy beginning to normalize and cool off from the insane growth we\u2019ve been seeing over the last few years, which I think is a good thing and a healthy way for an economy to act. But what we might start seeing, instead, is regulators allowing MORE people to get loans and further increasing prices\u2026just a little bit longer.\n\nBut my concern is, at what point does it stop? The more people who have access to loans, the riskier our market will become, and the higher the chances of them defaulting on payments. My other concern is that it appears as though the requirements for The Ultra FICO are absurdly low\u2026it\u2019s said that \u201cConsumers with an average balance of at least $400 who haven\u2019t overdrawn in the prior three months would likely get a boost.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the reality: For the right people, in the right hands, I\u2019m all for this. I know many, many responsible people who just decided not to play the credit card game because they never needed to, and those people are undeservingly hurt when it comes to getting a loan. \n\nFICO says this is really a way just to fill in the cracks of an underserved market, and a way to ease up lending to those individuals. They say it isn\u2019t meant to weed out applicants. Rather, it is designed to boost the number of approvals for credit cards, personal loans and other debt by taking into account a borrower\u2019s history of cash transactions, which could indicate how likely they are to repay.\n\nBut we\u2019ll see, I have a feeling this will have a minimal impact overall\u2026but I do think it sets the precedent that we\u2019re going to continue easing up on regulations, especially at a time where we\u2019re coming off such a great bull market and healthy economy\u2026and that is a bit risky. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Sapphire Reserve -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sT68EC\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/C9n4e3","publishedAt":"2018-11-02T22:30:00Z","tags":["Ultra FICO score","Ultra FICO","FICO score","how to increase your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit score 100pts","credit score increase","credit score explained","credit score tips","how to build your credit","how to build your credit score fast","how to build your credit at 18","how to build your credit with a credit card","how to build your credit fast","credit card tips","credit card churning","credit cards 101","graham stephan"],"title":"HUGE changes coming to your Credit Score in 2019\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-uERpelkNJo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-uERpelkNJo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-uERpelkNJo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-uERpelkNJo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-uERpelkNJo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M24S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1519","dislikeCount":"564","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10834","viewCount":"212119"}},{"id":"Ou0aG9enbmo","snippet":{"description":"Give me 45 seconds and I\u2019ll share with you why these Alex Becker ads are some of the BEST on YouTube, exposing why they\u2019re so effective, and how you can use this to better understand why people buy what they buy. Enjoy! Snap\/Insta: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME: Code THANKYOU50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy: Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $120 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c \n\nNow as we all know, with most ads like this, YouTube forces you to listen to the first 5 seconds before giving you the option to skip, so pretty much the ENTIRE advertisement relies on the effectiveness of whether or not there\u2019s an IMMEDIATE hook that gives you a reason to continue watching. This is where Alex Becker comes in IMMEDIATELY with what\u2019s called a Pattern Interrupt. \n\nA pattern interrupt is a technique to quickly change a particular thought, behavior, or situation, and REDIRECT your attention. It\u2019s a sudden shift from what we EXPECT to happen that breaks our habit or current state, and causes us to immediately return our focus. \n\nBut then we come to the second point\u2026Alex Becker gives us, what I like to call, the immediate \u201cminimum time investment.\u201d Really Quick. Just give me 45 seconds. In less than a minute. You\u2019re just that much more likely to hear it out, knowing it\u2019s only 45 seconds. \n\nIn order to win the next 40 seconds of an ad, you THEN need to implement three things: One: Be entertaining. Two: Be funny. Three: Don\u2019t be NOT Funny. Alex blends the three very effortlessly. \n\nHumor is especially important because it\u2019s the EASIEST way for someone to begin to let their guard down. Studies have shown the laughing makes it easier for two people to build a bond. It sets a friendlier mood, removes tension, and is more likely to disarm someone. From my perspective, being FUNNY is really just understanding social awareness and having the social intelligence to better understand PEOPLE\u2026and chances are, if someone understands PEOPLE, they\u2019re going to be someone that people are more likely to be friends with and trust. \n\nNext step is to show the viewers proof - not just visual proof, but social proof. You MUST show testimonials that OTHER people have taken action AND it\u2019s been successful. After all, if Alex just launched and he had no testimonials\u2026you\u2019d be less likely to take it, than if you KNEW thousands of other people did it and were successful. \n\nOh, and anytime people are on the fence about buying something\u2026always throw in more humor. Humor always works.\n\nIn addition, Alex Becker is the MASTER of re-targeting a warm audience\u2026this means, once you watch one of his videos or once you click one of his links, he can then re-target you with an ad. Why is this SO effective? Because you\u2019re MORE LIKELY to be receptive to an ad if you\u2019ve already seen that person before. \n\nIt\u2019s because of those specific actions I just mentioned that Alex Becker ads have some of the biggest impact here on YouTube, and I really believe that we can all learn a thing or two from sales by watching what other people are doing, understanding WHY they work, and then implementing them in your own YouTube ads\u2026if you ever do ads. Otherwise I hope this is just entertaining.

Here\u2019s 5 strategies that you can use to make instant equity when you BUY - enjoy!\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nWhen it comes down to making INSTANT MONEY, here\u2019s what I mean\u2026it means that you can purchase a property for LESS than what it\u2019s worth by understanding exactly what to look for. \n\nFirst, look at homes listed on the market over 100 days. From my experience, past 100 days is when homes have a VERY hard time selling\u2026the mindset of 99% of buyers is to pass it up because it\u2019s an old listing. As an investor, it\u2019s YOUR responsible to understand your local market and identify properties based on their REAL value, not the value of how many days its been listed on the market. Typically, the sellers of homes listed over 100 days on the market are DESPERATE to sell\u2026and many of them are already priced slightly below what they\u2019re worth thanks to an ineffective real estate agent. USE THIS TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. \n\nSecond, look at homes with really bad photography. PICTURES of a property don\u2019t dictate what the home is worth. The home is worth what it\u2019s worth\u2026but in terms of what you can buy it for, the less competition you have, the more leverage you have, which means the lower the price you can buy it for. Most buyers will pass this up!\n\nThird, look for properties with VERY little information listed.  For example, here\u2019s one little secret I\u2019ve used\u2026for some reason, if a real estate agent doesn\u2019t know the EXACT square footage, they just list it as 0. When ANY buyer or investor looks at a property, 99% of them put in a minimum square footage - because of that, these properties don\u2019t show up. I\u2019ve also seen listings that don\u2019t list the number of bedrooms or bathrooms, they don\u2019t use ANY description, and they combine all of this without any pictures\u2026it\u2019s crazy. And again, most buyers see this and automatically pass on it\u2026even though it could be the BEST HOME IN THE WORLD. LOOK AT THESE PROPERTIES. These are opportunities.  \n\nFourth, look for homes that need some cosmetic repair. Look for properties with old, dated kitchens\u2026maybe they have disgusting carpet. Peeling paint. Etc. Even though is going to cost you money to fix, this is generally the BEST, safest ROI out there when it comes to real estate. \n\nFifth, look for expired listings. Many times the seller wants to sell, although they don\u2019t want to list and go through the hassle again. By approaching these sellers, you can usually get a very, very good deal on a home!\n\nDoing this is all about knowing your market, understanding market inefficiencies, and knowing how to spot them! \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-28T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing no money down","real estate investing explained","real estate investing audiobook","real estate investing 101","how to invest in real estate","how to make money in real estate","instant profit in real estate","how to make money","passive income strategies","passive income ideas","passive income investments","passive income real estate","how to make money online"],"title":"How to make INSTANT PROFIT with Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ACQstkAdcHs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ACQstkAdcHs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ACQstkAdcHs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ACQstkAdcHs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ACQstkAdcHs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"742","dislikeCount":"95","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6465","viewCount":"212741"}},{"id":"MvMIp5PcanQ","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about the 5 most practical Rich People Habits you can start IMMEDIATELY that will make a huge difference financially, and ANYONE can implement these right now (you don\u2019t need to wake up early) - enjoy! Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nFirst\u2026MAKE A SCHEDULE THE NIGHT BEFORE. No matter how big or small, PLAN THIS OUT the night before so you don\u2019t just wake up and figure out with what you\u2019re going to do without a goal. Trust me, just seeing a to-do list is going to motivate you to get it done. And when it comes to productivity, that\u2019s what matters the most. \n\nSecond\u2026MAKE YOUR BED EVERY SINGLE MORNING. I NEVER did this before, but I gotta say\u2026it\u2019s nice. Apparently, the logic behind making your bed every morning is that it starts your day off right and sets the tone for the entire day. Basically, you\u2019ve accomplished the first task of the day and because of that, you\u2019re more likely to accomplish other tasks, as well. It\u2019s also supposed to relieve stress because you now have a clean, tidy room, and that encourages you to clean OTHER parts of the room and house to match the freshly made bed. With less mess, you can think better, and with that, you tend to do better work. \n\nThird\u2026GET THINGS DONE IMMEDIATELY. If there\u2019s ANYTHING I\u2019ve done that leads to increased productivity and money, it\u2019s NOT procrastinating on something. By doing it immediately, you\u2019re going to want to do other things immediately, too. \n\nFourth\u2026MAKING WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO A MUST. Tony Robbins talks about this all the time\u2026you have wants, and you have MUSTS. The wants just become desires, and the MUSTS become a reality. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how true this is. When you turn your goals or to-do lists into MUSTS, and you DO THEM IMMEDIATELY, they happen. If you want it badly enough, you HAVE to make it a MUST. \n\nFifth\u2026EXERCISE DAILY. I find that when I work out, I do better quality work, I think quicker, I\u2019m able to be more creative, and I\u2019m able to be a more energetic person. If you\u2019re not going to the gym, force yourself to go. Try it for 3 months\u2026even if that means you just go to the gym and walk on a treadmill for 20 minutes just to say you\u2019ve done, do it. Then evaluate after 3 months whether you feel it\u2019s a waste of time. I wholeheartedly agree that weight lifting or going to the gym has made me a MUCH more effective person, and a happier person. It becomes a huge stress relief, it\u2019s one of the few times I can just listen to music and zone out, and even if I didn\u2019t have ANYTHING else to do that day, as long as I go to the gym, I feel accomplished. \n\nAnd lastly\u2026do these consistently. This doesn\u2019t work if you do it for a week and stop. This is about doing this long term and making it a part of WHO YOU ARE, and from my perspective, these few habits make a NOTICEABLE difference. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-26T23:00:00Z","tags":["rich people habits","rich vs poor","rich people habits vs poor ones","rich people lifestyle","millionaire habits","millionaire blueprint","millionaire mindset","productivity tips","how to become a millionaire","how to be a millionaire","how to make a million dollars","how i became a millionaire","poor people","things poor people do","difference between rich and poor","think rich","how to grow wealth","financial independence","early retirement","retire early","real estate investing"],"title":"The 5 Rich People Habits to MAKE MORE MONEY ASAP","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MvMIp5PcanQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MvMIp5PcanQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MvMIp5PcanQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MvMIp5PcanQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/MvMIp5PcanQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2548","dislikeCount":"642","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"33193","viewCount":"504726"}},{"id":"YMQfUtOKtHo","snippet":{"description":"For anyone just starting out or who wants the best beginner \/ starter credit cards to build their credit score fast, these are the BEST options currently available, all completely free.

The good thing about this credit card is that they\u2019ll give 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants, and an unlimited 1% cash back on all other purchases. The dashboard also allows you to check your FICO credit score so you can keep an eye on how you\u2019re doing. All of this, with any annual fee.\n\nNumber 4: Citi Double Cash Rewards Card\nhttp:\/\/citi.us\/2ruNn49\nThis card gives you a whopping 2% cash back on ALL PURCHASES\u2026it gives you 1% when you make a purchase, and then another 1% when you pay it off. And the best thing about this 2% cash back is that it\u2019s consistent among all of your purchases. All with NO ANNUAL FEE. \n\nNumber 3: The Chase Freedom\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/2rx86Vc\nFor signing up, they\u2019ll give you $150 back after you spend $500 on the card within the first 3 months. They also offer 5% cash back on revolving categories up to $1500, as well as 1% cash back on everything else. Not AS good as the Citi Double Cash rewards card in the long term if you have a lot of spending, BUT the $150 sign up bonus definitely makes it worthwhile in the beginning. All for the low annual fee\u2026of NOTHING. \n\nNumber 2: Quick Silver Capital One\nhttps:\/\/www.capitalone.com\/credit-cards\/cash-back\/quicksilver\/\nJust like the Chase Freedom, you\u2019ll get $150 back after spending $500 in the first 5 months. The reason this can be SLIGHTLY better is that you\u2019ll get 1.5% cash back on EVERYTHING, AND you\u2019ll get no foreign transaction fees. So for people that like to travel, but who still want some cash back, this one is AWESOME. And again, all of this for the low fee\u2026OF FREE.\n\nNumber 1: Bank of America Cash Rewards Card\nhttps:\/\/www.bankofamerica.com\/credit-cards\/products\/cash-back-credit-card\/\nThis one offers a slightly higher signup bonus than the others\u2026$200 back when you spend the first $500 on the card within the first 3 months. That\u2019s really, really good. In addition to that, you\u2019ll get 3% back on gas stations, 2% back at grocery stores, and 1% back on everything else. AND you\u2019ll get a 10% bonus on these rewards when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America checking or savings account. And again, like every other card I\u2019ve mentioned here, this card costs you absolutely NOTHING\u2026so this is meant to be a card you get and just keep forever. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-24T21:30:02Z","tags":["best credit cards","best credit cards for beginners","best starter cards","best starter credit cards","best credit cards 2019","best credit cards to build credit","best credit cards for travel","best credit cards for college students","best cashback credit card","cashback credit card","how to build your credit score","how to raise your credit score","cash rewards card","credit cards 101","credit card churning","best credit card","asksebby","the credit shifu","best credit card for gas"],"title":"The 5 BEST Credit Cards for Beginners","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YMQfUtOKtHo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YMQfUtOKtHo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YMQfUtOKtHo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YMQfUtOKtHo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YMQfUtOKtHo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M20S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3667","dislikeCount":"486","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"31906","viewCount":"845933"}},{"id":"Wnz7zhwXeQg","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s EXACTLY how much a small, part time YouTuber makes in a year from YouTube\u2026so lets break down my ad revenue and all income sources.

The first is YouTube Ad Revenue. This is what I get paid every time an ad plays on one of my videos\u2026and this is paid out by Google Adsense only a monthly basis.\n2. The second is my revenue from the program I have created called \u201cThe Real Estate Agent Academy.\u201d This is a video program consisting of over 100 videos that teaches people how they can earn a six figure career working as a real estate agent.\n3. My third source of revenue is speaking engagements, where people will pay me to travel and discuss either real estate or social media. \n4. My fourth source is revenue is my consulting calls. Typically, most of my calls are analyzing real estate deals, working through hurdles as a real estate agent, or helping someone grow their social media account. \n5. My fifth source of income comes from those Amazon Affiliate Links you also see in the description that link to my favorite books. \n\n\nAll of this is VERY much a snowball effect that keeps growing the more you do it. Plus the more videos you have, the more views you get, and the more you make\u2026every single video posted just adds to that video backlog for people to enjoy. So who knows if this trajectory continues, maybe it will, maybe it won\u2019t\u2026but I\u2019ll definitely report back a year from now and let you know how this turned out. \n\nSo with that said, enjoy the video.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nLets begin here:\nWhen it comes to increasing your net worth, it only matters how much of that you can SAVE at the end of the day - not always how much you MAKE.  In order to hit $1 million in 10 years, you MUST cut back on your expenses for the sake of investing early on. You must think: is one decade of frugal living worth an entire LIFETIME of the freedom to do whatever you want, without having to worry about losing your job, doing something you don\u2019t want, or listening a some boss you dislike? \n\nWhat you\u2019ll realistically NEED to do to speed up this process is INVEST your money. If you want $1,000,000 in 10 years, it just comes down to you investing $6000 per month, every single month, for 10 years, while averaging a 7% return annually. If that happens, congratulations\u2026you\u2019ve become a millionaire in 10 years from investing $6000 per month.\n\nSo in order to increase your return without taking on TOO much risk of losing your money, you\u2019re going to need to spend your time actively WORKING on your investment\u2026and for me, as many of you know, my favorite way of doing that is in real estate. You can use your money as a down payment, remodel it, build equity, and then profit from rental income. \n\nBut in terms of increasing your income, you should work a career where your income isn\u2019t tied to the number of hours you work. Instead, if you\u2019re working in a sales environment, or ANYTHING that isn\u2019t dependent on the amount of hours you work, you can scale up rather quickly if you do well.\n\nAnother option is to start your own business\u2026this is a decision that\u2019s obviously is a big commitment to make, but I really believe that you can hit some BIG income if you get into an industry where you can scale quickly. And online, scalability is amazing\u2026it\u2019s the ability to reach tens of thousands for the same work it takes to reach 10 people. Because of that, you can leverage your effort - your not TIME - to increase your income. \n\nFrom there, it\u2019s a numbers game. Here\u2019s the video summed up:\nLive Frugally and cut back your expenses. \nIf you\u2019re income isn\u2019t high enough, you\u2019re going to need more money. The best way to do this is in a business where you don\u2019t get paid per hour\u2026your own business or working in sales is the best way to make more money if you\u2019re into it.\nInvest consistently. You need your money to do some of the work for you.\nIf you need to increase the returns, do some of the work yourself\u2026in my example, this was real estate\nContinue doing this. At this point, it\u2019s a numbers game and a patience game\u2026a million is just a number, and math exists to tell you exactly how long it\u2019ll take, and what goals you\u2019ll need to achieve in order to make that happen.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-19T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to be a millionaire in 10 years","how to be a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to be a millionaire in 3 years","how to be a millionaire in 5 years","how to be a millionaire in 1 year","how to be a millionaire dave ramsey","how i became a millionaire at 26","how to make a million dollars","how to make a million dollars a year","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","stock market investing","stock market 101"],"title":"How to be a Millionaire in 10 Years (Starting from $0)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XNOpdpydY_I\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XNOpdpydY_I\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XNOpdpydY_I\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XNOpdpydY_I\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XNOpdpydY_I\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M22S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5218","dislikeCount":"1322","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"69679","viewCount":"1319480"}},{"id":"K4ImvTvvmJ4","snippet":{"description":"After reading all the interest about Robinhood\u2019s 3% Checking Account, I did some research and found the BEST Savings accounts that offer the highest interest\u2026FDIC insured ;) Enjoy!

And this is with no strings attached\u2026no account minimums, no maximums, no need to make direct deposit every month to quality,  no conditions to meet\u2026no waiting list of over 700,000 to join\u2026it\u2019s just open up an account, put your money in, and enjoy a 2% return!\n\nSecond Bank: American Express Savings\nThey offer the same 2% return just like Ally Bank does. I\u2019ve been an American Express customer since 2012 and AMEX has been nothing but amazing. Their accounts also have no fees, no minimums, and a pretty decent way to get 2% return if you\u2019re already an AMEX customer. Oh, and it\u2019s FDIC insured ;) \n\nThird Bank: Capital One 360\nThey also offer a no fee account that offers 2% interest\u2026but they\u2019re not quite as good because to get the 2%, you need to keep a minimum of $10,000 in your account. So most likely, the other two options are a little better. \n\nFourth Bank: Marcus by Goldman Sachs\nRight now they offer a slightly better rate than the previous 3, at 2.05% interest! No account minimums and no requirements to meet!\n\nFifth Bank: Synchrony Bank. \nPretty much the same as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and they also offer the same 2.05%!\n\nSixth Bank: PNC Bank\nThey offer 2.35% interest. That\u2019s pretty much the highest that I\u2019ve found on a savings account without any account minimum, without any fees, or without any weird deposit requirements, without any waiting lists, and best of all\u2026while still having FDIC insurance!\n\nThere are several other nation wide banks that offer 2.4%+ interest\u2026although all of them had bad reviews, so I didn\u2019t feel comfortable listing them. \n-\nIn terms of other banks offering OVER 3% to match or even beat Robinhood\u2026yes, that does exist. There are several other REGIONAL BANKS that offer 3% AND HIGHER if you meet their requirements. The full list can be seen here:\nhttps:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/high-interest-savings-to-get\/\n\nSo while Robinhood seems like the BEST option in terms of no fees, no requirements, and no minimums to make 3%, it MIGHT not be worth the risk if they don\u2019t have SIPC insurance confirmed. \n\nAnd this video is really about just giving you some other ideas and options besides Robinhood. Even though you\u2019ll make a bit less than 3%, the result is pretty negligible..the difference of .65% on $20,000 is only $10.83 per MONTH\u2026and for that price, I think getting a better bank with better customer service is totally worth the price. So I hope this video was able to give you some solid options to think of!\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-17T23:30:00Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood checking","robinhood app","robinhood checking account","robinhood investing","robinhood app review","high interest savings account","high interest checking account","high interest savings","high interest cd","american express savings","ally bank","pnc bank","capital one 360","amex savings account","best online bank","how to make passive income","passive income 2018","passive income ideas","how to invest","how to invest online","best online investment"],"title":"I found the MOST PROFITABLE Savings Accounts (It\u2019s not Robinhood)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K4ImvTvvmJ4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K4ImvTvvmJ4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K4ImvTvvmJ4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K4ImvTvvmJ4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K4ImvTvvmJ4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M23S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2246","dislikeCount":"339","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8528","viewCount":"294465"}},{"id":"0gfT7I6X_Qc","snippet":{"description":"If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is\u2026but does that apply to Robinhood\u2019s new 3% Checking and Savings accounts?

What makes this an amazing offer is that \u201cRobinhood Checking & Savings accounts come with no fees, minimum balances or deposit requirements.\u201d Also, interest is paid out DAILY\u2026that\u2019s absolutely incredible. \n\nThe \u201ccatch\u201d here is that because Robinhood isn\u2019t technically a \u201cbank,\u201d you\u2019re actually opening a brokerage account where your money isn\u2019t FDIC insured. So instead, they offer SIPC Insurance. SIPC protects you up to $250,000 in cash, or $500,000 in assets upon broker failures\u2026this means that if Robinhood ever closed down due to financial difficulties and assets went missing, SIPC steps in to help return client\u2019s money. This does NOT apply if Robinhood mismanages funds or breaks regulation. It\u2019s not quite as strong as FDIC insurance, but it\u2019s relatively safe as long as Robinhood is in compliance. \n\nAnother small risk here is that the President and CEO of SIPC claims that \u201cSIPC protects cash that is deposited with a brokerage firm for one limited purpose...the purpose of purchasing securities. Cash deposited for other reasons would not be protected.\u201d\n\nRobinhood claims that because the checking and saving products are technically part of a brokerage account, they would be protected by SIPC like other brokerage assets. People can trade stocks and other assets through the brokerage using the money in these checking and savings accounts. Personally, this sounds a little sneaky of Robinhood to call this a \u201cchecking account\u201d\u2026but characterize it as a brokerage account.\n\nSo how are they able to even pay out a 3% in the first place?\n\nThe way I see it, this is their cost of customer acquisition. This is how much they believe ONE customer is worth to them, long term. They want people to talk about it, they want people to be Robinhood customers, and in order to do that, they have to do something DRAMATIC\u2026otherwise no one would bother moving their money over. \n\nFortunately for them, this is just going to be a Short Term loss\u2026I have a feeling we\u2019ll see ALL checking accounts offering a 3% interest rate in the next 10-15 months. And by then, they lose the early mover advantage of offering this before anyone else.\n\nHere\u2019s what I think is going to happen\u2026this is going to be a loss leader for the company. I also think Robinhood is going to SIGNIFICANTLY underestimate how many people will sign up for this service, as well. But as long as they have the funds, they will manage just fine. Now of course you run the small risk of them being a newer company that\u2019s not FDIC insured\u2026and the \u201cRisk\u201d is really only for an extra 1% compared to keeping your money in Ally, for instance\u2026so is it worth the risk? Maybe. \n\nAlso if something happens to Robinhood and they break the law, and SIPC insurance says \u201cyou called it a checking account, we\u2019re not covering it\u201d\u2026you might be out of luck. \n\nThe good news is that Robinhood doing this forces OTHER companies to be more aggressive with their checking and savings account returns, and I bet we\u2019re going to see many other companies follow this move coming in January!\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-14T20:00:00Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood brokerage","robinhood 3%","robinhood checking","robinhood saving","robinhood checking and saving","robinhood new 3%","robinhood 3% account","robinhood checking account","robinhood app","robinhood review","robinhood investing","robinhood options trading","robinhood gold","robinhood day trading","robinhood trading","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","buying stocks robinhood","how to buy stocks","how to make money","robinhood stock review"],"title":"A warning about Robinhood's 3% Checking Account\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0gfT7I6X_Qc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0gfT7I6X_Qc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0gfT7I6X_Qc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0gfT7I6X_Qc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0gfT7I6X_Qc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M17S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1842","dislikeCount":"257","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7151","viewCount":"287950"}},{"id":"qgEDW_HcRHY","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s my thoughts about what\u2019s happening with the real estate market, some things to watch out for, and my personal opinion of what I think is going to be happening with Real Estate in 2019. Add me on Snapchat\/Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGet $50 off for a LIMITED TIME with code ThankYou50 - The Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nHere what effects prices:\nLets start with interest rates\u2026because I guarantee this is going to be a hot topic in 2019, and this pretty much has a ripple effect across the economy. My prediction for 2019 is that the FED is going to be VERY strategic with their rate increases\u2026they see the immediate impact a rate increase has on the stock market, and any HUGE rate hike would be detrimental to the economy. Because of that, I think we\u2019ll see rates increase about half a point in 2019. \n\nNext, lets talk about supply and demand - and with that, we\u2019ll talk about excess inventory because the two are directly correlated. I\u2019m personally seeing a LOT of excess inventory coming from new constructions and investors who started their projects 6-18 months, and are just now coming to the market as they finish completion. Because these properties NEED to sell, oftentimes because the owners take out short term loans to save money on interest, they\u2019ll be priced fairly aggressively to get them off the books. \n\nIn terms of price appreciation, much of this will be very location-dependent. I think we\u2019ll see some markets do considerably well, for instance around the Amazon HQ2 locations. Overall, I\u2019m going to say real estate prices are likely to increase about 3-4% in 2019\u2026basically just inflation, plus an extra 1-2% on top of that. \n\nAnd one last thing, is that we\u2019ve definitely seen some stock market turmoil lately\u2026this does INDIRECTLY effect the price of real estate, as investors have less money to invest when they lose money in stocks. I personally think 2019 won\u2019t be a stellar year for stocks, and I\u2019d expect things to continue to stay relatively flat.\n\nNow at the end of the day\u2026all of this considered, long term, this really won\u2019t make any difference. 30 years from now, you\u2019re not going to be worried about whether or not you should\u2019ve bought a year later or a year sooner\u2026it won\u2019t make a difference. And as an investment property, when people don\u2019t buy, they rent\u2026and this means rentals do well in a \u201cbad\u201d economy. When we\u2019re in a great economy and people are buying, housing prices go up and you\u2019ve \u201cmade equity.\u201d Either way, long term investment property wins. \n\nSo to sum things up:\nIn 2019, I predict we\u2019re going to see interest rates between 5.4-5.5%\nI predict we\u2019ll continue to see excess inventory coming on the market\nI predict it\u2019ll take sellers LONGER to sell their property\nI predict that overall, we\u2019ll see about a 3-4% appreciation on prices \nI predict stocks will have a relatively flat year, again\n\u2026and I predict that you\u2019ll smash that like button. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-12T23:30:03Z","tags":["real estate","real estate prices","real estate prediction","real estate price prediction","real estate drop","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing audiobook","passive income real estate","passive income ideas","passive income online","passive income explained","how to make money","real estate prices 2019","home prices","real estate agent"],"title":"My Real Estate Prediction for 2019...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qgEDW_HcRHY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qgEDW_HcRHY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qgEDW_HcRHY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qgEDW_HcRHY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qgEDW_HcRHY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1308","dislikeCount":"376","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8492","viewCount":"235849"}},{"id":"jW_qexpG4u8","snippet":{"description":"Lets break this down and talk about how you can actually double your money and exactly what\u2019s involved in doing so.

In terms of where to invest, it really comes down to one of two choices:\n\nDo you have TIME?\nAre you ok with RISK?\n\nNow the reality is that if you have NO time and a don\u2019t care about how high risk it is, you just want a chance at doubling it\u2026 go and put it on the Roulette table. On the other hand, if you have some TIME and DON\u2019T want to risk losing all of your money in a matter of seconds, you need to be more strategic with what you decide to invest. \n\nAll investments fall in these four categories:\nHIGH RISK \/ HIGH RETURN\nHIGH RISK \/ LOW RETURN\nLOW RISK \/ HIGH RETURN\nLOW RISK \/ LOW RETURN\n\nGiven this, the first thing you need to ask yourself is how much RISK you\u2019re willing to take to double your money? Are you okay with potentially losing money in an effort to double it? Are you OK taking a short term loss? Or do you have all the time in the world to nearly GUARANTEE you can double it in a reasonable time?  \n\nFirst of all, if you want a fairly safe way to double your money because you have TIME\u2026 it\u2019s as simple as Compound Interest and Waiting. And that is what\u2019s called The Rule of 72. \n\nThe Rule of 72 is an easy calculation to determine how long it\u2019ll take you to double your money. You simply divide the number 72 by the expected return of your investment and THAT is how many years it\u2019ll take to double.\n\nIf you generally want to achieve a return HIGHER than what the overall market returns, which is averaged around 7-9% annually long term, you\u2019ll either need to make RISKIER investments to aim for a higher return, OR invest your own time to speed up the process. \n\nIf you\u2019re the type who\u2019s okay making some riskier moves, you might want to make some speculative investments in cryptocurrencies, Forex, penny stocks, individual stocks, or maybe you day trade stocks on margin\u2026but remember, it\u2019s VERY easy to lose money just as easily as you can MAKE money. \n\nIf you don\u2019t take the you\u2019ve gotta compensate for that by WORKING to double your money, instead. For instance, consider flipping items on Craigslist or eBay. If you have more money, steady income, good credit, and the time to learn the business - I\u2019ve seen many real estate investments where you can double your money within 3-6 months. But other options here can be using this to start a business.\n\nSo if you plan to go this route, you can ABSOLUTELY find some great ways to double your money within a year by doing most of the work yourself\u2026but you have to be prepared to WORK, because that\u2019s the only factor that will replace RISK for a high return. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how you can double your money!\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-10T23:30:00Z","tags":["double your money","how to double your money","how to double your money fast","how to double your money 2019","double your money 2019","how to invest","how to invest 2019","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate 2019","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","real estate 101","stock market 101","real estate passive income","passive income 2019","how to make passive income","passive income ideas"],"title":"HOW TO DOUBLE YOUR MONEY","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jW_qexpG4u8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jW_qexpG4u8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jW_qexpG4u8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jW_qexpG4u8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jW_qexpG4u8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1232","dislikeCount":"409","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12832","viewCount":"216265"}},{"id":"TwsPE3zPpfU","snippet":{"description":"When it comes to investing in real estate, it\u2019s important to understand what to avoid\u2026with that said, this is what NOT to do\u2026enjoy.

This is why it\u2019s so important that you KNOW how to properly evaluate a property, understand how much it\u2019ll cost to renovate, AND realistically understand what the property will rent for.\n\nSecond: Taking on too much debt. Since you took on too much debt, your payments become considerably higher because you have a larger mortgage\u2026and unless you either have the income or savings to carry the mortgage in the event of a vacancy, you can lose money really, really quickly. \n \nThird: Don\u2019t take out a short term loan, or an adjustable rate mortgage. Interest Tates will inevitably GO UP as time goes on\u2026this means that your payments will get dramatically more expense. I recommend getting a long term, fixed rate, 30-year mortgage - this is the safest option out there, with the likelihood of the most profit long term. \n\nFourth: Picking a bad tenant. Do not necessarily pick the person who offers the highest price, either. Get a tenant who will stay long term, pay on time, no hassle, etc. You\u2019ll make the biggest mistakes when you rush the process. Learn from my mistakes here. \n\nFifth: Overpaying for the property. When it comes to real estate, your money is VERY MUCH made at the time of purchase\u2026 Obviously don\u2019t lose out on the perfect deal for a few grand, but also don\u2019t pay more than what the numbers say it\u2019s worth. \n\nSixth: Buying and renovating a property without having enough cash saved up as a reserve. Anytime you buy a property, it\u2019s so important that you have enough money to cover ALL the renovations + 30% extra because that\u2019s going over budget, AND enough to sustain the mortgage and all property expenses for at least 3-6 months. KEEP THIS AT ALL TIMES. That way when something comes up, it\u2019s no big deal and I\u2019ve already got all the money to cover it. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-08T17:00:03Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","real estate investing explained","real estate investing strategies","investing in real estate with little money","investing in real estate rentals","real estate market","real estate agent","real estate news","how to make money in real estate","passive income ideas","passive income","passive income real estate","how to make money online","real estate 101"],"title":"How NOT to Invest In Real Estate!!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TwsPE3zPpfU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TwsPE3zPpfU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TwsPE3zPpfU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TwsPE3zPpfU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TwsPE3zPpfU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M58S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1110","dislikeCount":"224","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"30418","viewCount":"423689"}},{"id":"zBNpqSMiffY","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s a step by step guide of How to Invest in 2021 and the basic strategies to begin investing and growing your wealth - enjoy!

You can also use a few other high interest bank accounts, like Barclays, Sychrony Bank, or American Express Savings\u2026they all currently offer around a 2% return.\n\nSecond\u2026and this is arguably the most important part of this entire video\u2026when it comes to investing, especially if you\u2019re JUST starting out, is set up a Roth IRA. This is basically an account that you can put money into, and by the time you\u2019re 59.5, you can pull ALL of your profit completely tax free without paying ANY capitals gains tax. Vanguard has a great option for a Roth IRA if you chose to invest with them. \n\nNow third, in terms of WHAT to invest in, my BIGGEST recommendation for MOST people out there is to invest in an index fund with a low expense ratio. When people always ask \u201chow can you get an averaged 8% return\u201d\u2026this is pretty much my advice. Long term, historically, over the last century, the stock market has returned about 8% annually, adjusted for inflation, with dividends re-invested. \n\nOk\u2026number 4\u2026and I figured I\u2019d put this here instead of listing it back to back with the Roth IRA\u2026but that\u2019s setting up a Traditional 401k. This is an account where whatever you contribute is deducted from your total taxable income, and you can grow your investment tax free until you take it out at 59.5. This means that you\u2019ll have MORE money to invest because you\u2019re paying LESS in taxes. The \u201ccatch,\u201d however, is that you\u2019ll pay taxes on whatever you take out of your account after the age of 59.5.\n\nNow number 5\u2026back to investment options. If you want to, or you\u2019re interested in doing a little more work, you can invest in individual stocks. I personally recommend you try to do this within a Roth IRA or 401k to avoid getting taxed on your profits\u2026but this isn\u2019t required. You can just as easily open an account on Robinhood, invest in individual stocks commission free, and reap some pretty great returns. \n\nNow Number 6\u2026my favorite\u2026obviously\u2026is investing in real estate Real Estate. Now unfortunately, this is one of those things that you\u2019ll probably need to work up to. Especially if you\u2019re just starting, unless you have a decent amount of money to already work with, I\u2019d probably recommend saving up or investing elsewhere and then coming back to real estate one you have some capital to work with. Typically, you\u2019re going to need about a 15-20% down payment - which could be a lot of money depending on where you\u2019re planning to invest. \n\nBut real estate is my favorite for a few reasons:\nThe first if that you get immediate cashflow from renting it out.\nSecond, because of all of the tax deductions, most of that income you make is tax free\nThird, you\u2019re able to BORROW most of the money to buy real estate and slowly pay that off over time\nFourth, you\u2019re building up equity as you pay down the loan - so eventually you\u2019ll own it outright\nAnd finally, the property is likely to increase in value over time\n\nThis is why it\u2019s no surprise that 90% of the world\u2019s millionaires are created through investing in real estate\u2026and I\u2019m absolutely no exception! \n\nAnd finally\u2026number 7\u2026drum roll\u2026is investing into a business. And this is probably where you can get the highest return from just about ANYTHING I\u2019ve mentioned so far, or pretty much ANY other investment out there. \n\nNow these are just a few ideas for you to go out and consider\u2026some people might say forex trading, swing trading, etc, the list goes on. But as I mention time and time again, the higher the return, the riskier the investment, and that\u2019s absolutely something to take into consideration.\n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2018-12-05T23:30:01Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in 2019","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest money","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest 1000 dollars","how to invest in the stock market","how to invest money as a teenager","how to invest in real estate for beginners","how to invest in real estate with no money","how to invest in a business","investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","stock market 101"],"title":"How To Invest in 2021 (How ANYONE can be RICH)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zBNpqSMiffY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zBNpqSMiffY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zBNpqSMiffY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zBNpqSMiffY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zBNpqSMiffY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5210","dislikeCount":"1214","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"80843","viewCount":"1380669"}},{"id":"N049u8B184g","snippet":{"description":"The moment you\u2019ve all been waiting for\u2026lets ruin all of my credit cards and see how they hold up.

This is the TOTAL amount of income the property will be generating, BEFORE expenses. \n\nIn addition to rents, it\u2019s important to calculate any other income that property generates. \nFor example, I\u2019ve seen some properties that have laundry unit income\nI\u2019ve seen some that charge separately for storage. \nSome that charge separately for parking. \n\nNow we need to go to the next step: EXPENSES. \n\nAnytime you own a property, you\u2019re going to have FIXED EXPENSES NO MATTER WHAT - this means that even if you bought the property outright IN CASH, NO MORTGAGE, you\u2019re still going to have these expenses\u2026they\u2019re fixed, and there\u2019s no way around it. \n\nThese expenses include:\nProperty taxes - that\u2019s unavoidable \nInsurance - you better have insurance\nIf there\u2019s an HOA - I don\u2019t like HOA\u2019s\nIf you pay utilities for the tenants - make sure they save water\nNormal upkeep - like a gardener, pest control, etc.\nRepairs that need to be done \nIf there\u2019s any management fee \nAnd vacancy when inevitably a tenant will move out and you\u2019ll be missing out on that rental income\n\nAfter that - we\u2019ll need to calculate our NET RENTAL INCOME. Subtract EXPENSES by GROSS INCOME and this is your net income. From this, your can calculate your CAP RATE:\nDivide the NET rental income by the purchase price, then multiply that by 100, and what you have left over is your percentage return.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the Mortgage Payment. Use http:\/\/www.MortgageCalculator.org to calculate your mortgage payment.\n\nFrom there, subtract your mortgage payment from the NET RENTAL INCOME and that is your return!\n\nBut then we also have the RETURN ON EQUITY. Remember, every month you pay down your mortgage, part of that payment is interest on your loan balance, the other part is EQUITY towards paying down the loan\u2026because remember, after 30 years, you\u2019ll have no more mortgage and you\u2019re owning this out right. So every month that goes by gets you closer to that goal. \n\nIn order to calculate how much equity you\u2019re paying down, lets go back to MortgageCalculator.org, look under \u201ccalculate\u201d where it says \u201cshow amortization schedule.\u201d Then click \u201cshow annual amortization.\u201d Then hit calculate. \n\nSo now, we add this back into our income, and that becomes your TOTAL ROI. \n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly how I calculate the cashflow of a property. With this entire formula, you can pretty much just plug in your own numbers and spit out the expected return!n! \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-01-30T23:30:02Z","tags":["How to invest in real estate","how to calculate rental income","how to analyze rental income","how to calculate cashflow","rental property cashflow","how to analyze cashflow","biggerpockets","calculating numbers on a rental property","how i analyze a rental property","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","how to make passive income","passive income","passive income ideas","investing in real estate","real estate investing with no money","passive income 101"],"title":"How To Invest In Real Estate: The ULTIMATE Guide to Calculating Cashflow (EASY)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DgWcrsavcJs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DgWcrsavcJs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DgWcrsavcJs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DgWcrsavcJs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DgWcrsavcJs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1545","dislikeCount":"157","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"24781","viewCount":"268665"}},{"id":"GJDxfrYmBAk","snippet":{"description":"In this video, I sit down with Dan Lok to discuss how he began investing and how he developed his high income skill.

And I put this one first because it\u2019s the aspect that most people never overcome.\u2026I can\u2019t tell you how many people I see who know EVERYTHING but don\u2019t have the self initiative it takes to actually use what they learned, because there\u2019s SOMETHING that\u2019s always holding them back. In order to be successful early in life, you will NEED to have the self initiative to push through this.\n\nOnce you\u2019re beyond that, the second step you\u2019ll really need to learn is to become an independent thinker. Don\u2019t be manipulated by other peoples opinions, don\u2019t be swayed by what someone says, don\u2019t be constantly seeking approval from what you should or shouldn\u2019t be doing. And when you do this, you aren\u2019t making decisions out of fear\u2026you\u2019re making the decisions taking everything into consideration and making the best choice FOR YOU. And THIS is why those people become successful and end up making a ton of money. \n\nThe next skill you\u2019ll need to develop once you learn how to take initiative and think for yourself, is to learn the power of persuasion. In fact, this is probably one of the most important skills in this entire list. Just think of it\u2026nearly EVERYTHING you do in life is persuasion. The BEST resource, by far, is a book called \u201cHow to win friends and influence people.\u201d Also, this book is free if you just search that title.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done all of that, the next skill to learn is Leadership. It\u2019s learning how to be an example for everyone else around you, it\u2019s having the conversations that most people avoid, it\u2019s making the tough decisions that many people put off, and it\u2019s by teaching through example. In order to really get this skill, it\u2019s about DOING exactly what you preach\u2026and leading really encompasses everything I\u2019ve talked about so far in this video. If you learn the characteristics of a successful leader, it\u2019s something that will follow you ANYWHERE you go with ANYTHING you do. \n\nAnd finally\u2026all of this would fall apart without this last one, and that\u2019s the skill of time management. This is an absolutely ESSENTIAL step to getting rich in your 20\u2019s\u2026or really any age for that matter\u2026 because you NEED to have the discipline to know when to work, what to work on, and what needs to get done. AND you\u2019ll need to prioritize all of that! And if there\u2019s ANYTHING that we all have in common, where NO ONE has an advantage over anyone else\u2026it\u2019s that we all have the same 24 hours in a day. \n\nSo there you have it\u2026the 5 steps that you need to follow in order to get RICH in your 20\u2019s\u2026everyone who I\u2019ve seen with money early on has had these 5 qualities. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-01-25T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to get rich","how to get rich in your 20s","fastest way to get rich","Financial Freedom","how to build wealth","how to build wealth with low income","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to build wealth with real estate","how to build wealth dave ramsey","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to make money","passive income","passive income ideas","Investing for beginners"],"title":"5 Steps To Getting Rich In Your 20's","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqjnsFY8O3k\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqjnsFY8O3k\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqjnsFY8O3k\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqjnsFY8O3k\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqjnsFY8O3k\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M38S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1934","dislikeCount":"104","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5566","viewCount":"70256"}},{"id":"_mof2NeK1LI","snippet":{"description":"2- Month Free SkillShare Trial (First 500 People): https:\/\/skl.sh\/grahamstephan2\nThanks for watching!

And to make this 15 minute video, there\u2019s about 8 hours of work that goes into it behind the scenes:\n-First, you have to come up with a topic.\n-Then you then need to plan it out\u2026doing this can take another 1-2 hours. I don\u2019t just talk off the top of my head with whatever comes to mind\u2026to make my videos, I plan out what I\u2019m going to say and in what order I say it. This way, I make sure the video flows nicely, it doesn\u2019t jump around from topic to topic, it can keep your attention, and I don\u2019t miss out on saying anything important. \n-And after it\u2019s all planned out, I film it. To have a 15 minute video, it\u2019s easily 45-60 minutes of filming AT LEAST. \n-Then you\u2019ve gotta EDIT the video. \n-Then I need to edit the thumbnail\n-Then I need to come up with a catchy title\n-Then I\u2019ll spend a solid 20 minutes writing this description that you see\n-Then I spend another 1-2 hours answering comments\nSo all in all, I\u2019m easily spending 8 hours creating the 15 minutes that you can watch and enjoy right now. \n\nThe second expectation: Make a lot of money\nBloomberg found research that suggests that nearly 97% of YouTubers will never make enough to break the US poverty line. To be in the Top 1% of all YouTube channels, you\u2019ll need over 2.2 Million Views Per Month. And chances are, even then\u2026at that point, it comes down to how well that YouTuber fits the mold for \u201cAdvertiser Friendly Content.\u201d However, despite what ad revenue pays, how much a YouTube channel REALLY makes is entirely dependent on how good that creator is at monetizing and treating it as a business. \n\nThe third expectation: It\u2019s fun!\nI\u2019d say 90% of the time I absolutely LOVE the process\u2026however, there are times I\u2019m not in the mood whatsoever. I just feel down. I don\u2019t feel like I can put on a happy, energetic vibe and make a good video. There\u2019s also the constant pressure of making the videos I find interesting, but also ones that do well and enjoyed by you watching\u2026also, dealing with comments can be a struggle and it\u2019s easy to let them get to you. And I\u2019m sure most YouTubers will never mention this\u2026but I know it\u2019s true for EVERYONE\u2026is that at a certain point, it\u2019s easy to tie your own personal success with the amount of views and likes you get. The hedonic treadmill is real. \n\nThe fourth expectation: You have total freedom and creative control to say whatever you want! \nAs you gain a larger following, what you say and how you act ends up influencing a lot of people, and they put their trust in you that you\u2019ll have their best interest at heart. It\u2019s definitely something not to be taken lightly, and everything I do publicly is crafted around being a good role model for anyone who watches me. If I say or do something really, really, stupid, it can absolutely have career ramifications for the rest of my life. And also, as I become a bigger channel, I have more influence, and that means it\u2019s easier to become a target.

LIMITED TIME DISCOUNT: https:\/\/grahamstephanstore.myshopify.com\/\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nA Roth IRA just stands for Individual Retirement Account. Think of it this way\u2026just like you have a bank account where you have access to a savings and checking account, you can open up a Roth IRA account and have access to your INVESTMENTS.\n\nAnd here\u2019s how the Roth IRA works:\nYou\u2019re able to open up one of these accounts and deposit up to $6000 PER YEAR if you\u2019re under the age of 50\u2026and if you\u2019re over 50, you can contribute $7000 per year. \n\nThe MASSIVE advantage to doing this is that ALL the money you deposit into this account will grow entirely tax free. For example, if you contribute just $400 per month into a Roth IRA starting at the age of 18\u2026and you average a 7% return on your money annually\u2026you\u2019ll have nearly $1.2 MILLION DOLLARS completely tax free at the age of 59.5\u2026all from $400 per month. \n\nEven more remarkable, if you contribute the maximum of $6000 per year starting at the age of 18\u2026and you average a 7% return\u2026you\u2019ll have a staggering $2.1 MILLION Dollar by the age of 65. Let me say that again\u2026$2.1 MILLION DOLLARS TAX FREE from just a $6000 investment per YEAR. And I\u2019ll show you exactly how to do that. \n\nThe other HUGE advantage to opening up one of these accounts is that you can withdraw WHATEVER money you\u2019ve deposited to that account, at any point, without any penalty, and without paying any additional taxes on it.\n\nAnd the BEST time to start doing this is NOW when you\u2019re young. This is because when you\u2019re young, you have the power of COMPOUND INTEREST working on your side. This means your money makes you more money, that makes you more money, that makes you more money.\n\nThe other advantage of starting when you\u2019re young is that, like I said, you invest with post tax money\u2026meaning, again, your taxes have already been taken out of what\u2019s left over. This means that when your young, chances are you\u2019re not making much money and you\u2019re already in a low tax bracket to begin with\u2026meaning you have MORE of your money left over to invest.\n\nSo here\u2019s exactly how to do this and how this works:\nYou can setup a Roth IRA through websites like Vanguard.com, Charles Schwab, or Fidelity to name a few\u2026but there are dozens of options out there. \n\nOnce you open the account, you\u2019ll then have the option to make investments WITHIN that account\u2026remember, the Roth IRA itself isn\u2019t the investment\u2026it\u2019s just an ACCOUNT for you to invest in for your money to grow tax free.\n\nIn terms of which investments to make, I PERSONALLY just chose an index fund that follows the stock market\u2026but it\u2019s up to you. You also have the choice to invest in stocks, as well, within a Roth IRA.\n\nHowever, pay attention to this because there are FOUR very important rules you MUST abide by:\n\nFirst: As of 2019, you\u2019re limited to $6000 per year that you can contribute to this account. This is your maximum. \n\nSecond: Anytime you take money out of the account, you can\u2019t just put it back at a later time. So once it\u2019s out, it\u2019s out. You\u2019re limited to just $6000 per year that can go into that account. \n\nThird: If you take out your PROFIT prior to the age of 59.5, you\u2019ll have to pay a 10% penalty + pay taxes on that profit. And that defeats the entire purpose of opening up this account, if you have to pay taxes.\n\nFourth: If you make MORE than $120,000 per year\u2026you\u2019ll need to do a Backdoor Roth IRA. Just google that because I have a feeling not many people are watching this making more than $120k\u2026and if you\u2019re making $120k, you can just google this. It\u2019s simple. \n\nSo basically\u2026as long as you can follow those four rules, you could be well on your way to becoming a tax free millionaire with just a small investment each and every month! \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-01-21T23:30:01Z","tags":["roth ira","roth ira explained","roth ira vs traditional","roth ira vs 401k","roth ira investing","roth ira vanguard","roth ira millionaire","roth ira investment options","tax free millionaire","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","roth ira compound interest","compound interest","roth ira 2019","compound interest formula","compound interest explained","early retirement","retirement accounts","investing in stocks","how to invest","vanguard","stock market investing"],"title":"Roth IRA: How to be a TAX FREE MILLIONAIRE with $12 PER DAY","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-53ZTJmDUA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-53ZTJmDUA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-53ZTJmDUA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-53ZTJmDUA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-53ZTJmDUA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M29S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4184","dislikeCount":"517","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"39781","viewCount":"750336"}},{"id":"wm9YCmFpIWQ","snippet":{"description":"Here is my Comprehensive, Step By Step guide on How To Buy A House in 2021 - enjoy!

Repeat, and every step of the way can be worth anywhere from $100-$600 depending on the offer and how much money you have to work with. . \n\nNow of course, there are a few downsides to doing this\u2026they aren\u2019t major, BUT, this is what you need to watch out for:\n\n1. The first is that some banks will require you keep a minimum average balance, otherwise they\u2019ll charge you a maintenance fee.\n2. The second downside is that most of these accounts aren\u2019t offering you a 2.25% interest rate like accounts such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs or PNC bank. This means that you LOSE that 2.25% interest rate in exchange for getting a larger cash bonus\u2026however, in almost every circumstance, the short term bonus you get is worth substantially more than the interest you\u2019d get just keeping it in another account. So the net profit is going to be worth it. \n3. And finally, this takes a little more time to do this than just signing up for a credit card\u2026opening up a bank account is slightly more involved, not by much if you can do it all online\u2026but it still takes a little work.

Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t familiar with what Peer to Peer lending is:\nThese are websites like LendingClub and Prosper that act as an intermediary to match people who need to borrow money, with people who have money to lend. They\u2019re pretty much offering YOU the opportunity to be the bank for someone else, and get paid back that interest. \n\nHowever, these are my concerns:\n\nFirst: Fees. As an investor, lending club charges a 1% fee on any payments you receive from the borrower\u2026so already, whatever return you WERE getting, is now reduced by 1%.\n\nSecond: Defaults. If a borrower DOES NOT pay their loan, lending club charges a 40% fee on any amounts collected on a delinquent loan that went to litigation. According to them, they have an approximate default rate of about 7.8%. And keep in mind since the borrowers agreement is between themselves and lending club\u2026not YOU and the borrower\u2026you can\u2019t do anything about it. You have no recourse. \n\nThird: Lack of liquidity. Once you invest in a note, technically you\u2019re tying up your money for 3-5 years until that loan matures\u2026and that also assumes the borrower pays off the loan in time. If you need your money sooner, you\u2019re forced to sell your loans on the secondary market\u2026usually for a steep discount,\n\nFourth: Taxes then become an issue because your returns are seen by the IRS as ORDINARY INCOME, meaning they\u2019re taxed at your highest marginal tax rate. And depending on how much you make, this could be a lot. Compare this to long term capital gains, which for most people is just a flat 15%.\n\nFifth: Risk of analyzing borrowers. Many P2P sites assume no risk in analyzing the credit worthiness of the borrowers. And this seems like people can easily take advantage of this. \n\nSixth: Default rates like this will ABSOLUTELY be going up if the economy begins to decline. The FIRST THINGS people stop paying is unsecured debt, like personal loans and credit cards\u2026This leads me to think that whenever our economy begins to falter, the returns you\u2019ll see on peer to peer lending websites will drop substantially, and at a time when you\u2019ll WANT to have access to your money to invest in other opportunities, but you can\u2019t because your money is tied up on these websites. \n\nIt\u2019s for all of these reasons, you should do your own research to determine if peer to peer lending is right for you. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-01-11T23:30:02Z","tags":["peer to peer lending","peer to peer lending investment","peer to peer lending explained","peer to peer lending review","peer to peer lending app","lendingclub","prosper.com","passive income","passive income 2019","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","p2p lending","p2p lending investment","p2p lending platform","how to make money online","best online investments","best investments 2019","investing for beginners","passive income step by step","passive income investments"],"title":"WARNING: Why Peer To Peer Lending is a BAD INVESTMENT","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/19_lW_Su4sA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/19_lW_Su4sA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/19_lW_Su4sA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/19_lW_Su4sA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/19_lW_Su4sA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M1S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1566","dislikeCount":"466","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"14484","viewCount":"228048"}},{"id":"8bXEBg1EXAI","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s exactly how I was able to increase my passive income from $6370 per month to $7930 per month within just one year, and some of the tips I\u2019ve learned along the way.

Anytime you\u2019re investing your MONEY for passive income, have the same outlook. Unless the fundamentals of your investment have MASSIVELY changed, just hold and continuing investing by trusting the process that long term, you\u2019ll do just fine. \n\nHiring a property manager. Even with their fee, it took a massive mental burden off my shoulders in terms of managing a property and a brand new tenant. \n\nThird, I\u2019ve continuing to live frugally and invest when I find a good deal. Even though $4900 per month is coming straight from rents, I still do my best to save as much of that as I can and just re-invest it into more real estate whenever I find a good enough deal. For all of you watching, none of this would\u2019ve ever been possible had I not lived frugally, saved as much as I could, and invested everything I had when the fundamentals made sense. \n\nAnd fourth, one last thought I\u2019d like to make\u2026even though I\u2019m against trying to time the market, or wait for a recession or anything before buying in\u2026just understand that if prices GO DOWN, THIS IS GOOD. I made my best investments in 2011 and 2012\u2026people were telling me NOT to invest, that the markets were going down even further, that I should just hold cash\u2026 Instead, I bought long term, when it made sense, for the right deal, and just held\u2026then saved for more. \n\nWhen building up your passive income empire, start small\u2026focus on one dollar at a time, and continue growing it to something huge. \n\nIf you\u2019ve actually read this far, I hope you appreciate the transparency - I\u2019m doing these videos as an example of what\u2019s possible and to plant the seed why passive income and investing is absolutely important. \n\nThanks again for watching!

Companies like Chase Sapphire Reserve and American Express began offering incredible signup bonuses to lure customers. But this is only sustainable for so long before too many people begin to outsmart the system\u2026like us\u2026and begin using their \u201ccustomer acquisition\u201d as an exploit for profit. \n\nVox.com published that:\n\u201cSources have told the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0that companies like Citigroup, JPMorgan, and American Express are currently talking about reassessing their credit card rewards program because they\u2019ve realized they\u2019ve been offering too many rewards.\u201d\n\nThese recent moves by credit card companies were for customer acquisition. They WANT people to get in the door and become customers\u2026and they\u2019re hoping most people will be lazy and not cancel their card, they\u2019ll never redeem their points, and maybe they\u2019ll continue using the card once they get it. Credit card companies only make a small portion of their money from interest\u2026they make the vast majority of their profit from transaction fees the merchant pays every time you use your card. So for people who just stop using their card after meeting the minimum spend, then use the points\u2026that\u2019s obviously NOT profitable for them. \n\nI DO think the golden era of credit card churning is coming to an end. It won\u2019t be gone entirely, but they will absolutely begin changing up how they offer points and how they reward brand loyalty. \n\nWe\u2019ve already seen it happening\u2026Chase Sapphire Reserve down to 50,000 points. Chase is now only allowing one sapphire card per customer. Other chase cards gave up price protection. They\u2019ve began limiting how many guests you can bring in the priority pass lounge. And I personally think we\u2019ll continue to see fewer and fewer rewards in the coming year. \n\nHowever, the good news is that I highly doubt this would ever go away, entirely\u2026while they may have offered TOO MUCH in the past, they\u2019re still going to offer SOMETHING - it just might not be as good. Or maybe we\u2019ll see smaller rewards coming annually.\n\nI also think we\u2019re going to start to see these credit cards also giving you bonus on OTHER banking services, which is where they can start making A LOT more profit. For instance, open up our checking account\u2026and once you\u2019re in our system, we\u2019ll get you a car loan, a mortgage, personal banking, investment management\u2026and your LIFETIME value will vastly outpace the reward we give you upfront.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-01-07T23:30:02Z","tags":["Credit card","credit card rewards","credit card rewards explained","credit card rewards points","how to increase your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit","how to get a good credit score","how to get a good credit score fast","credit score explained","credit score","american express","capital one","chase sapphire","chase sapphire reserve","chase ink","amex gold","amex platinum","asksebby","thepointsguy","thecreditshifu","credit cards 101"],"title":"THE END of Credit Card Signup Bonuses??","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Wvh2PoKb_qA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Wvh2PoKb_qA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Wvh2PoKb_qA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Wvh2PoKb_qA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Wvh2PoKb_qA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M47S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1594","dislikeCount":"208","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8723","viewCount":"141833"}},{"id":"fvK6ihMzJbE","snippet":{"description":"These are the potential problems with renting a property on Airbnb and exactly how to avoid them as an investor\u2026enjoy!

In fact, I\u2019m all for it\u2026in many tourist dense locations, it just MAKES SENSE\u2026if you can make QUADRUPLE the profit from renting your home short term, and you\u2019re okay with the turnover\u2026I think it\u2019s awesome and using Airbnb would be the financially SMART move to make. \n\nHowever, there\u2019s a big distinction between THAT\u2026and whereI see many, many people going wrong.\n\nMany people have started to BUY properties specifically with the intention of renting them out on Airbnb\u2026they\u2019re buying properties that would NEVER cash flow or make a profit otherwise, and they rely on Airbnb and other short term rental websites to cover the cost of the home. This is where the problem begins.\n\nFirst of all, if you\u2019re buying a property for an investment, number one\u2026above everything else\u2026MAKE SURE IT CASH FLOWS without Airbnb. This is where MOST people go wrong in terms of their investment\u2026if you rely on Airbnb for a property to cash flow, you\u2019re doing it wrong and exposing yourself to a LOT of risk in the event that Airbnb is further regulated and then you lose money.  I\u2019d say the chances of this happening is fairly high. \n\nInstead, you should view Airbnb as a way to supplement your income. If you have a cash flowing property BUT you can make more renting it on Airbnb, GO FOR IT and ride that gravy rain while complying with local regulations. In the event something happens and you can no longer rent it on Airbnb, like many places here in LA, no worries\u2026you\u2019ve still got a cash flowing property, anyway and it won\u2019t hit you hard. Airbnb should be like the icing on the cake\u2026not the cake itself. If you can follow that, you\u2019ll be just fine. \n\nIn addition to that, it\u2019s important to realize that the reason many people make so much money on Airbnb is because it requires a LOT of work. I know many people who run Airbnb\u2019s and it\u2019s a hustle to make sure the house is fully cleaned, sheets washed, and everything fully stocked after each guest. Many people will have minor issues and questions when they move in, as well, and it\u2019s very important to EXPECT that and not be caught off guard when that happens. \n\nWith that said, if you use airbnb responsibly, comply with local regulation, buy a cashflowing property from the beginning, and use airbnb for ADDITIONAL income as an investment property\u2026I\u2019m all for it and you can make a LOT of money by doing this. \n\nJust don\u2019t RELY o this. I really believe the debates with Airbnb has just begun, and it\u2019s going to take another 5-8 years or so for all of the fine print to be sorted out on both sides. I think we\u2019ll go from having NO regulation, to TOO MUCH regulation, and then working out a fair middle ground\u2026right now, we\u2019re heading in the direction of TOO MUCH regulation, and it\u2019ll be up to investors and home owners to prove otherwise. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSuggested reading:\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Agent:\u00a0http:\/\/goo.gl\/TPTSVC\nYour money or your life:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/fmlaJR\nThe Millionaire Real Estate Investor:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/sV9xtl\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/1f3Meq\nThink and grow rich:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/SSKlyu\nAwaken the giant within:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/niIAEI\nThe Book on Rental Property Investing:\u00a0https:\/\/goo.gl\/qtJqFq","publishedAt":"2019-01-04T23:30:00Z","tags":["airbnb","airbnb rental property","how to rent your home on airbnb","airbnb nightmare","airbnb business","airbnb tips","airbnb automated","airbnb party","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate for beginners","how to invest in real estate 101","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 101","how to make money in real estate","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income real estate","renting on airbnb","investing in airbnb","real estate"],"title":"The BIGGEST PROBLEM with renting your home on Airbnb...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fvK6ihMzJbE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fvK6ihMzJbE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fvK6ihMzJbE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fvK6ihMzJbE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fvK6ihMzJbE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M23S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"936","dislikeCount":"232","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"5558","viewCount":"185363"}},{"id":"z1MrIYjrlso","snippet":{"description":"When it comes to learning how to make more money, I\u2019ve noticed a few MAJOR differences between the people who make a normal, average income and the person who earn a LOT of money..this is what they are.

This sounds soooo simple, yet so many of us don\u2019t pay attention to this. Instead, most people take financial and career advice from the person drowning in debt who doesn\u2019t know how to properly use a credit card or they listen to the person who\u2019s making $40,000 a year who\u2019s discouraging them from starting a business \u201cbecause it\u2019s too competitive.\u201d The reality is that if you want their lifestyle and income, take their advice\u2026because that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. \n\nSecond: Don\u2019t re-invent the wheel. People have already accomplished what you want to do, so you may as well learn from them. Do what works, follow the formula, and listen to the people who have what you want!\n\nThird: Make sure what you do is scalable. If something works and you want more of it, it needs to be scalable. It needs to be just as easy to make $250k per year as it is to make $250k per month. There\u2019s only so much you can do with your own time!\n\nFourth: Do what you love. If there\u2019s ANY commonality in the people who are making a TON of money and are really, truly successful\u2026not just by making a lot of money, but also feeling personally fulfilled..it\u2019s this. They\u2019ve all totally loved what they do. If you don\u2019t have that same feeling, it\u2019s going to be TOUGH achieving those same results. When you enjoy what you do, it makes it that much easier to get through the times where you make no money, the times when you work REALLY long hours, or those times you feel stuck\u2026those don\u2019t even matter if you\u2019re having fun, and if it never feels like work.\n\nFifth: Have patience. Nothing happens overnight. Enjoy the process of meeting new clients. Enjoy the process of building out your business. Enjoy the process of making youtube videos that no one watches. Keep at it, because it WILL pay off if your patient to see the end result. \n\nFor business inquiries or paid one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting or coaching, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-01-02T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make money on shopify","how to start an online business","how to invest","how to invest in the stock market","passive income for beginners","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","real estate investing 101","success habits","rich vs poor","rich people habits","what do rich people do","rich people lifestyle","millionaire lifestyle","how to be successful"],"title":"The 5 Secrets to making a TON of Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z1MrIYjrlso\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z1MrIYjrlso\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z1MrIYjrlso\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z1MrIYjrlso\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z1MrIYjrlso\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2293","dislikeCount":"221","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"22122","viewCount":"240049"}},{"id":"ETrIyfercuE","snippet":{"description":"Lets breakdown the new 2019 apple credit card rumors, discuss what\u2019s confirmed, and how this would do as an every day credit card - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: $100 off for the first 10 people with Coupon Code 100OFF:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv\n\nNow here\u2019s some background:\nApple is teaming up with Goldman Sachs to bring us a new credit card in 2019. The credit card will be running though the MasterCard Network. As of now, Apple stated that they first plan to test this credit card among employees before rolling it out to the public sometime this year. \n\nThey also announced they\u2019ll be offering 2% cash back on purchases, as well as advanced integration into their apple-pay app, which will allow users to potentially better track their spending and budgeting. Some executives have said the payment tracking could be similar to their fitness app, which will rewards users who meet their spending and saving goals. \n\nBesides these confirmed statements, we really don\u2019t know MUCH more about what the card will offer. We don\u2019t know if it will have an annual fee, we don\u2019t know if it will have a sign up bonus, and we don\u2019t know if it will have higher reward tiers if its users purchase apple products\u2026which, lets be real, 99% that\u2019s probably probably going to happen. \n\nNow on the surface, this doesn\u2019t appear to be too revolutionary of a credit card, besides the fact that the card is coming from Apple\u2026so why is Apple doing this, and could they actually turn this into successful smash-hit credit card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve was?\n\nTo start, I think this is a REALLY unique market for Apple to get into for a variety of reasons\u2026Their iPhone market is, in my opinion, reaching a point of diminishing returns - the newer models aren\u2019t THAT much different from the older models, and raising prices on the newer phones deters people from \u201cupgrading\u201d when their current phone works just as well and DOESN\u2019T cost $1000. \n\nHowever, Apple has amassed such a large, loyal following within the apple ecosystem, with over 1.3 BILLION active devices worldwide\u2026and from a business standpoint, it becomes MORE pertinent to begin growing a business of long term, recurring, stable revenue\u2026which is\u2026drum roll\u2026THE APPLE BUSINESS ECOSYSTEM. \n\nAnd when it comes to making profit, the credit card industry is pretty much just a license to print money. ESPECIALLY if they find a clever way to integrate and sync the credit card with the iPhone, in such a way where it\u2019s BETTER AND EASIER to use THAT credit card over any OTHER credit someone might otherwise use. \n\nTheir partnership with Goldman Sachs is also quite unique and strategic. Their partnership with Apple means two things:\nOne, they can leverage apple\u2019s loyal fan-base to increase business to their banking and lending services \nTwo, They can expand their consumer industries market with a credit card\n\nIn return, Apple could potentially form further partnerships with Goldman Sachs in the future - for things like lending, financing, or other banking related services, which is something that Apple is currently lacking. So from my perspective, I see this as a win-win. \n\nSo we\u2019ll wrap this video up with some final thoughts: How well do I think this will ACTUALLY do as a credit card?\n\nTo be honest, I think, it\u2019ll do well. REALLY well. If they\u2019re appealing to the majority of people out there who pay with debit cards, don\u2019t follow credit card rewards, and just want a simple straight forward credit card to make purchases with - they\u2019ll do extraordinarily well by just offering 2% cash back. This competes with cards like the Citi Double Cash, with the added benefit of offering iPhone integration in a unique way that might make budgeting a little more fun. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-02-27T23:30:00Z","tags":["apple credit card","apple credit card review","apple credit","apple rumors","apple rumors 2019","apple rumors credit","apple leaks 2019","credit card","credit card churning","how to increase your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit score 100 pts","credit card rewards","chase sapphire","american express","robinhood app","how to get a good credit score","best credit cards","best credit cards 2019","credit card review"],"title":"NEW Apple Credit Card 2019: Rumors and Breakdown","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ETrIyfercuE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ETrIyfercuE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ETrIyfercuE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ETrIyfercuE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ETrIyfercuE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"653","dislikeCount":"31","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1957","viewCount":"41325"}},{"id":"moeFp6Y4zGE","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s EXACTLY how you can get your first 1000 subscribers  and make money on YouTube- Enjoy! Instagram: GPStephan - BRAND NEW: The YouTube Creator Academy: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv\n\nWithout further ado, here are my EXACT strategies I used to grow from 0 to nearly 380,000 subscribers in 24 months - and how you can replicate these step by step techniques as well:\n\nFIRST:\nWhen you\u2019re just starting out, the most important thing you can do is have good content. The content that I\u2019ve found does best gets you engaged within the first 30 seconds, and then goes right into the point of the video without wasting time. \nAnd in terms of having good content, fun fact: it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be high quality, either. I grew my channel to 30,000 subscribers with over 1.3 million views by filming from my iPhone.\n\nSECOND:\nThe next most important part of a video and growing your channel to 1000 subscribers is the SEO, which stands for search engine optimization. This includes your title, tags, and description\u2026when you\u2019re just starting, good SEO is INSANELY important. Without properly filling out the tags, title, and description, YouTube won\u2019t be able to analyze enough about the video to determine what the video is about and won\u2019t be able to rank it or promote it among similar videos. And this is MASSIVELY important. \n\nTHIRD:\nThis is also probably just as equally important, if not MORE important than a title. Think of it this way - half the time you don\u2019t even read the title, but you look at the thumbnail FIRST, title second. Use this to your advantage. Your thumbnail should be enticing enough for people to want to know more - this is where you can clickbait your audience\u2026.without actually click baiting. Feel free to get creative with your thumbnails and make THIS your clickbait, while still keeping the title a little more specific about what the video is actually about. This gets the best of both worlds! \n\nFOURTH:\nThis is a big one\u2026upload frequency. I\u2019ve found that the more I upload, the more likely YouTube is to continue recommending my videos on a larger scale because they\u2019re confident that this is the type of channel that gets people regularly coming back. I saw the biggest push from my channel when I went from 2x uploads per week to 3x uploads per week\u2026and I\u2019ve stayed consistent with that now for 2 years. \n\nFIFTH:\nI\u2019ve noticed that youtube tends to promote the videos with high channel engagement. This means that people like the video, comment, share, subscribe, and watch more of your videos. They want to make sure that people don\u2019t just watch one of your videos, click out, and never return. The more engagement you get, the more interactive the audience, and the more likely YouTube is to say \u201cthis is a good video, people like it, there\u2019s a sense of community, we should continue pushing this video.\u201d \n\nSIXTH:\nHere\u2019s one of the most PRACTICAL steps when it comes to gaining subscribers, and this is probably the EASIEST and FASTEST way to get to 1000 subscribers in under a month for most people:\n-Make sure you have a recognizable youtube channel thumbnail that gets peoples attention\n-Change your name to something like \u201cYour name - your video topic\u201d \n-Then, comment as early as you can on larger channels once they post a video\u2026preferably, comment as soon as the video goes live. This increases your likelihood that people see your comment and like it. \n-Quickly go and upvote your comment several times from several accounts. I\u2019ve found that if your comment gets to about 3-5 likes relatively quickly after posting, youtube pushes it up to the top and everyone sees it. \n-People will then naturally like your comment once they see it already has a few likes on it\u2026they\u2019ll go to your page, check it out, and if ALL OF THE ABOVE LOOKS GOOD - they\u2019ll subscribe to you.\n\nThis is by far the BEST way to gain an organic audience of 1000 subscribers!\n\nSEVENTH:\nFrom my videos that have ended up doing really well, they all had one thing in common\u2026they got a higher than normal amount of views and comments within the first hour of posting. In order for videos to hit this sweet spot, it has to be on a topic that\u2019s relatable to a wide audience, family friendly, a title and thumbnail that makes people want to click, and a video that gets people engaging with it. The more you post, the more likely this is to happen. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-02-25T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to get 1000 subscribers on youtube","how to get 1000 subscribers","how to grow on youtube","how to get 1000 subscribers on youtube trick","how to get subscribers fast","how to get subscribers on youtube fast","how to get subs fast","how to grow on youtube 2019","how to grow on youtube fast","youtube algorithm","youtube algorithm 2019","how to get 1000 subs","youtube growth strategies","youtube growth tips","youtube growth 2019","how to make money online","passive income"],"title":"HOW TO GET 1000 SUBSCRIBERS ON YOUTUBE IN 2021","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/moeFp6Y4zGE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/moeFp6Y4zGE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/moeFp6Y4zGE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/moeFp6Y4zGE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/moeFp6Y4zGE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M56S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2413","dislikeCount":"84","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6889","viewCount":"67973"}},{"id":"F3w-J_Svlyc","snippet":{"description":"As one of the few Real Estate guys here on YouTube, I felt it was worth addressing and responding to Gary Vee\u2019s thoughts on homeownership - and this is my view.

But there are situations where home ownership can be TREMENDOUSLY more profitable than anything else you do. So how do you know which category you fall into?\n\nWell: \n\nIf you\u2019re buying a home to impress your friends - I think that goes without saying, that\u2019s stupid.\nIf you\u2019re buying a home because you want to say you \u201cown a home\u201d - chances are, that\u2019s not a smart move.\nIf you\u2019re maxing out what you can afford just to buy a the largest home you can - Ummm\u2026no. \nIf you want buy a house to live in, but you also want the flexibility to move around as often as you like, wherever you like - Then I have a feeling, you\u2019re better off renting.\nIf you\u2019re running a business where every single dollar you invest BACK into that business doubles your profit - well, it\u2019s safe to say, then you should focus on that BUSINESS and not tie up capital in a down payment buying a house, and I think Gary is right. \n\nOn the other hand:\nIf you\u2019re buying a home because it\u2019s undervalued and you can fix it up to make a profit - chances are, that\u2019ll be good move.\nIf you\u2019re buying a home because it\u2019ll be a cash cow rental property after you\u2019ve lived in - that\u2019s a good move. \nIf you\u2019re buying a home because you\u2019ve crunched all the numbers and discovered the NET cost to own is CHEAPER than renting - then you should absolutely go for it, and buying a home can be a smart financial move.\n\nHere\u2019s the point I\u2019m getting at though - your INTENTIONS and REASONING for home ownership should be the main topic of discussion, not the act of buying a home itself. \n\nAnd unfortunately, the biggest problem I see with home ownership is that nearly EVERYONE considers their home an INVESTMENT, when in fact, very few people EVER truly run the numbers to determine whether or not it\u2019s ACTUALLY a good use of money. \n\nIn order for a home to be an INVESTMENT to me, it needs to be something I can buy under market value - it needs to be something I can fix up to further increase the value - it needs to be something that cash flows - and it needs to be something that would get me at LEAST a comparable return to investing in the stock market. Now, do MOST people think of any of this when they buy a home? The answer is NO. \n\nSo why do people call their home an investment, anyway? For most people, owning a home just acts like a forced savings account, where every month you put some money away where it\u2019s safe. \n\nThe thing is, when you begin viewing home ownership as an INVESTMENT FIRST, PLACE TO LIVE SECOND - it\u2019s like starting to see the entire world in the matrix, where you notice the things most people don\u2019t. Once you start viewing home ownership as not a GOAL to accomplish, but whether or not it\u2019s a viable INVESTMENT - you begin filtering out all the non cash flowing properties, all the homes that barely make a profit - and instead, you can focus on few homes that becomes a money making machine. It\u2019s also important to COMPARE that money making machine with other investment opportunities you have access to, and then decide from there - based on your risk tolerance - if it\u2019s a good move or NOT. \n\nAnd unfortunately, like I said, almost no one does this. \n\nAnd uhhh\u2026yeah.

Now when I mean \u201cholding cash,\u201d I don\u2019t mean like you\u2019re actually just holding cash...don\u2019t take that term literally. Instead, I\u2019m referring to either keeping a ton of cash laying around under couch or a mattress because you don\u2019t trust banks or something, or maybe you just keep your money in a checking account or regular savings account - which, unfortunately, is what most people do, and that ends up unknowingly costing them money. Don\u2019t do that. \n\nAnd this is why you should avoid that: INFLATION. This means that the value of your money DECREASES every single year, because\u2026summed up\u2026the country prints more money than there is value. In 99% of situations, when you just keep cash as cash\u2026you lose money. If you keep money in a checking account, you lose money. If you keep cash in a normal savings account earning .1% interest, you lose money. This is bad. And that\u2019s where most people make the mistake of losing money without even realizing it. So with that said, here are 5 options so you can avoid this: \n\nThe FIRST place you can put your money is a high interest, FDIC-insured savings account:\nAlly Bank: 2.2% Interest on their savings account \nMarcus by Goldman Sachs: 2.25% on their savings account\nPNC bank: 2.35% on their savings account \nCIT Bank: 2.45% interest for accounts that have a balance above $25,000. \n\nSECOND, if you want a SLIGHTLY better return and don\u2019t need the money immediately, your next option is a CD. \nAlly Bank 12-month No Penalty CD: 2.3% interest\nCapital One 360 12-month CD: 2.7% interest\nMarcus By Goldman Sachs 12-month CD: 2.75% interest\nSyncrhony Bank 12-month CD: 2.8% interest with $2000 minimum deposit\n\nThird: TREASURY BILLS. \nThis is basically a short term \u201cloan\u201d you give, and in return for lending them money, they pay you back with interest. The good thing about Treasury Bills, and a HUGE advantage over anything else, is that they\u2019re not subject to local or state level taxes\u2026so for people in high tax states like California or New York, this could save you a TON of money in taxes! \n\nSo the way this works is you can go on TreasuryDirect.gov, make an account, and then purchase 4-week treasury bills, which currently pay 2.428% interest annually. You can also set this up to re-invest every 4 weeks, so that way you\u2019re constantly getting a high rate of return - tax free on the state level - without thinking about it. \n\nFifth Option: buying a bond.\nFor instance, we have the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor Shares\u00a0(VWEHX)\u2026this pays a whopping 6.1% right now, which works out to be 5.87% after fees. Now this is NOT a risk free return, the price of the bond COULD go down, the payout of the bond COULD go down\u2026or they could both go UP and you make more money. But for someone willing to take a little more risk with their money, this is a decent way to take a LITTLE risk with some decent upside. \nhttps:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/mutual-funds\/profile\/VWEHX\n\nOr, you have the total bond market index VBMFX\u2026after expenses, you\u2019re looking at about a 2.9% annual return. And this one is much less volatile. \nhttps:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/mutual-funds\/profile\/VBMFX\n\nNonetheless, this could be a decent option if you want to take on a little more risk with your money, while still maintaining liquidity in the event you need it immediately. \n\nSo there you go\u2026don\u2019t hold on to cash, because if you do, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time and you\u2019re going to lose money with inflation, which is EASILY avoidable if you just put your money in a few of the options I mentioned here. And ALL of these options take you under 10 minutes to setup\u2026it\u2019s really simple, and a great way to PRESERVE your wealth and keep it liquid until you need it for other investments.

What is going to give me the highest return, with the LEAST amount of risk? And also, how much risk do I need to take, how hard do I need to work for that, and what\u2019s going to get me the best value? \n\nHere\u2019s my thoughts when it comes to what I want to do in 2019:\n\nFirst, I\u2019m planning to use about 60% of my income this year to diversify and strengthen my stock market portfolio. This is something I pretty much see as a lower risk, lower time commitment, and yes\u2026lower return investment. I think a more beefed-up well balanced portfolio would insulate me from anything outside my control and give me a little more liquidity, in the event I ever needed it. This move is really about spreading out my risk and also taking a more passive approach when it comes to investing this year - just for the sake of rounding out my investments.\n\nSo when it comes to doing this, because everyone just wants specific information, I\u2019ll likely be investing a significant portion of my income between three funds - this strategy is also known as the \u201cThree Fund Portfolio\u201d:\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll be investing about 70% in  Vanguard\u2019s Total Stock Market Index - VTSAX. \nSecond, I\u2019ll throw about 20% in Vanguard\u2019s International Stock Market Index - VTIAX. \nLastly, I\u2019ll just throw 10% remaining in the Vanguard Bond Market - VBTLX. \n\nThis strategy is more about investing in something completely hands off, zero work, just set it and forget about it\u2026and this way, I\u2019ll have the peace of mind knowing that I\u2019m investing in something I consider 100% passive income. \n\nNow my SECOND investment will be back to real estate\u2026in previous years, this was my priority\u2026but this year, it\u2019s taking the back seat, but it\u2019ll be a fun one. About 30% of my income this year will be saved up, cash, in high interest savings accounts earning about 2.2% or so. I\u2019ve been somewhat casually looking at real estate to buy this year, but I just can\u2019t find anything that\u2019s worth getting\u2026\n\nAnd when I look at real estate, I look for VALUE\u2026I buy places I\u2019m 100% sure I can make money on\u2026and from the properties I\u2019ve seen so far, I just can\u2019t find anything that\u2019s a sure thing. So instead, here\u2019s where I\u2019m starting to realize there\u2019s a lot of opportunity: DEVELOPMENT. This is where my cash is going to come in handy. \n\nFor instance, I have one unit where once the tenant moves out, I can spend about $60,000 fixing it up, and I\u2019d be able to make an extra $1100 per month in rent. This is over a 20% CASH RETURN ON MY MONEY. \n\nAlso, like I mentioned a few months ago when I did the house tour of the new place I just bought, I\u2019d eventually like to spend about $200,000 and create what\u2019s called an ADU on the property - this is an Accessory Dwelling Unit, and this is just a fancy term for a guest house. Basically, I can build a $200,000 guest house and rent that out for about $1600 per month. That works out to be nearly a 10% cash return on my money - pretty much risk free, especially if I paid for this in cash.\n\nSo right there, with about $260,000 spent\u2026I can make a guaranteed $2700 per month EXTRA with no additional debt, and no risk. To me, that\u2019s the IDEAL scenario, and I can\u2019t imagine any other investment I could possibly make right now that would give me those numbers. \n\nSo between those, that\u2019s pretty much where most of my money is going this year.

Consider this: the BIGGEST advantage of investing in your 20\u2019s is the power of compound interest: this is the concept that your money will make you money, which then make you more money, which will then make you more money. The longer you have to invest, the more your money can make you more money. \n\nNow the second mistake is something that we\u2019re all guilty of at some point\u2026and that\u2019s blindly listening to someone else investment strategy, without fully understanding the investment. \n\nFirst, your investing goals are likely different than the person you\u2019re copying. Your age, risk tolerance, resources, and investment goals are likely much different.\n\nSecond, you should only invest in stocks or businesses you understand\u2026otherwise, if it fails, you\u2019ll just sit there and blame everyone else for why you lost money. And that\u2019s a lot easier to do than to take a look in the mirror and realize that YOU are responsible for your own actions, even if you follow someone else\u2019s recommendation - you need to be disciplined enough make your own decisions that you believe in and fully understand. \n\nAnd third, you\u2019ll likely have different entry and exit points than the person you copied. By the time someone posts about their trade, most likely several hours or DAYS have passed by and the investment price has changed. Same with their exit point\u2026you have no idea when they\u2019ll exit their position\u2026what if they sell shortly after, and you don\u2019t find out until weeks later, while you\u2019re still holding on to it?\n\nNeedless to say, this is not a sustainable trading strategy. Don\u2019t do this. Instead, I recommend listening to what other people are trading\u2026understand WHY they\u2019re buying them, and then do your own research to verify if this is something you should also look into. \n\nThe third biggest mistake I see is probably THE most common of everything I\u2019ve seen, and that\u2019s timing the market. The best strategy when it comes to doing this is simply buy, and hold. That\u2019s it. The reality is that 99.99% of people won\u2019t be able to time the market consistently and accurately. \n\nNow the fourth biggest mistake\u2026and I guarantee everyone goes through this, and that\u2019s getting too emotional or attached to your investment. This is a really, really tough one for people to overcome because we have a few things that get in the way:\n\nThe first is FEAR. And it\u2019s true\u2026the fear of LOSS is much, much greater than the upside of GAIN. We FEAR losing what we already have, and that clouds our judgement to grow MORE of what we DO have. \n\nSecond, we have Ego. Sometimes we\u2019ll pick a stock and REFUSE to admit that maybe we\u2019re wrong\u2026even if we begin to lose money when we hold on to it too long.\n\nWhen it comes to investing, leave emotion out of it\u2026focus strictly on fundamentals. \n\nAnd finally\u2026we have the almighty number five. And if you\u2019re not doing this, you absolutely NEED to as soon as this video is over\u2026and that\u2019s NOT taking advantage of tax advantaged accounts. These are accounts that you can utilize to save you TONS in taxes, and there\u2019s NO reason not to take them\u2026ever. Always take them. The Roth IRA, 401K employer match, or the HSA. Do them all.

Enjoy!

And how long it will take you to achieve financial independence depends entirely on this: how much income you make, and how much of it you save. This is what Mr Money Mustache, a financial independence blogger, calls \u201cThe Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement\u201d - and based on your own income and expenses, you can calculate within a few minutes how long it\u2019ll take you to retire. \n\nThe second rule of financial independence: cutting back expenses. \nFor the sake of saving more money and moving up your FIRE timeline, you MUST do what you can to save more money. The first, and biggest expense we ALL have is housing. It\u2019s reported that 30-50% of a person\u2019s income JUST goes to housing\u2026 that\u2019s too much. And there\u2019s a better option where you might be able to cut down your housing costs ENTIRELY, and this is what I\u2019ve been doing:\n\nThis is where you buy a multi-family home, like a duplex, triplex, or fourplex, then live in one of the units and rent the others out. You could also buy a single family home with a detached guest house, or maybe a basement you could rent out to bring down your cost of living. Typically, when done right, those other units will cover the entire cost of owning the building - and all of a sudden, you\u2019ve got a free place to stay. \n\nBesides housing, another large expense we tend to have is our car. If you\u2019re a car guy like me, and want to drive something fun and cool, you can buy a car at the bottom of its depreciation curve, drive it a few years, and sell it for about the same price you bought it for. \n\nThen, lets focus on entertainment\u2026and when it comes to achieving financial independence, I think it\u2019s important you find a healthy balance. Go ahead and enjoy life, you don\u2019t need to be locked inside all day just for the sake of saving money\u2026but, be mindful to spend money where it matters the most FOR YOU. \n\nOr with travel\u2026some people LOVE traveling. I found it doesn\u2019t need to be expensive: you can learn the art of credit card churning for signup bonuses\u2026and travel for free. \n\nThe third step of achieving financial independence: Staying out of high interest debt. \nThis kinda goes hand and hand with cutting back and saving, but most people don\u2019t realize just how much high interest credit card debt or high interest medical bills or huge student loans hold you back. Throughout my entire life, I\u2019ve made sure to stay out of ANY debt that\u2019s not a low-interest car payment or a low-interest, fixed rate mortgage. That\u2019s IT. \n\nThe fourth step of financial independence: INVEST. \n\nThis is another very, very simple one. The principles are as easy as this:\n-First, take advantage of your 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA accounts because these save you on taxes\n-Second, Invest consistently, long term - put a set % from each and every paycheck into your investments, no matter what. Ideally, at least 20% of your paycheck, minimum. Preferably more. \n-Third, don\u2019t time the market - invest long term consistently, regardless of where the price is.\n-Fourth, invest in a low-fee index fund that covers the entire market - like VTSAX. Vanguard and Fidelity both offer extremely low index fund fees. \n-Fifth, wait. Let the markets do their thing. \n\nAnd here\u2019s when you find out when you\u2019re financially independent: you can retire when your investment portfolio becomes 25x what you spend every year, also known as The Trinity Study. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-02-11T23:30:00Z","tags":["financial independence","financial independence retire early","financial independence documentary","retire early","retire early tips","retire early with real estate","mr money mustache","how to achieve financial freedom","how to achieve financial independence","minimalism","how to live frugally","how to save money","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","stock market investing","investing for beginners"],"title":"How To Live Frugally and Achieve Financial Independence","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NuYPzliwY78\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NuYPzliwY78\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NuYPzliwY78\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NuYPzliwY78\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NuYPzliwY78\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M13S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3065","dislikeCount":"493","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"41039","viewCount":"913727"}},{"id":"vO74T2eN53U","snippet":{"description":"These are the biggest myths and lies when it comes to real estate investing, and my unbiased perspectives when it comes investing in real estate - enjoy!

And these are the situations where I\u2019d say people are better off RENTING instead of BUYING: \n\nThe first is that if they\u2019re new to an area and don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to like living there. In this case, you\u2019re better off renting until you get to understand the area and figure out where you really want to be. This one is pretty self explanatory. \n\nThe second is if they don\u2019t intend to keep the home for more than about 4-5 years. Here\u2019s the reality. Holding real estate for 1-5 years is not a long enough time to guarantee you\u2019ll have a positive return. We\u2019ve been lucky to see a huge surge of appreciation over the last 7 years, but this is not normal and we\u2019ve just come out of the worst recession we\u2019ve seen in a long time. Realistically, your house is not going to be going up in value 10% per year\u2026So this is why I recommend that people buy a home, who plan to hold on to it FOR AT LEAST 5-7 YEARS\u2026this gives you the highest chance to rebound from any fluctuations in price. Anything under that, and you\u2019re likely better off just renting. \n\nThe third reason you\u2019d be better off renting is if you have a better use for your capital than tying it up in real estate. Real estate is great for solid, long term wealth preservation and growth\u2026but it doesn\u2019t compare to investing that money in your own business in terms of ROI. So for most people who run their own cash flowing business, they prefer to LEASE and have as much free cashflow left over as possible to re-invest.\n\nThe next myth that is SUPER COMMOM is that YOU CAN\u2019T FIND A GOOD DEAL BUYING A HOUSE ON THE MLS. The truth is that the source of the deal does NOT matter, at all. I\u2019ve seen INCREDIBLE deals come up on the MLS, and because they were improperly advertised, they were overlooked and an investor was able to scoop in with a great deal. It\u2019s more important to actually find a good deal, than to focus on the SOURCE of that deal.\n\nThe next real estate investing \u201cmyth\u201d out there is that having more units equals more profit\u2026.again, this is something I hear A LOT and it\u2019s a misconception that I\u2019d absolutely like to clear up. Lets make it very clear: Having more units does NOT mean you will make more money. Just because you have 10 units doesn\u2019t mean that is a better investment than something with 2 units. When it comes to identifying a good investment, ALL that matter is how much money it makes after expenses, and how much you buy it for\u2026.that\u2019s IT. I\u2019ve seen HOUSES that are better investments than 10 unit buildings\u2026and I\u2019ve seen some 10 unit buildings as better investments as houses. It all comes down to the price you buy them for, that\u2019s it. \n\nThe next misconception when it comes to real estate is that you can TIME THE MARKET. Yes, if you can time the market, you\u2019re going to do REALLY well. But that\u2019s not what real estate is about: you buy on how much cashflow you make every month, and how much equity you can get on the deal based on the facts of TODAY. It\u2019s more important that you find the right deal TODAY, than hope the market crashes AND you buy in at the perfect time. \n\nAnd finally, the last real estate myth we\u2019re told is that it\u2019s a full time job investing in real estate. And this one is a little yes, and a little no. When it comes to real estate investing, it can really be as hands on or hands off as you\u2019d like\u2026you can work as hard as you want, or outsource as much as you want as long as your rental numbers are strong enough. \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-02-08T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 101","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate with no money","how to invest in real estate step by step","real estate investing tutorial","how to invest in real estate at 18","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 2019","rental income investing","biggerpockets","brrrr method","how to flip real estate"],"title":"The BIGGEST LIES in Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vO74T2eN53U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vO74T2eN53U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vO74T2eN53U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vO74T2eN53U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vO74T2eN53U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"684","dislikeCount":"86","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6047","viewCount":"170961"}},{"id":"suvpM843iJ8","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about a potential recession, what might  happen, and how you can best prepare - enjoy!

When borrowing gets more expensive, you either need to RAISE prices to keep the profit margins the same - which means things get more expensive to you as the customer.\n\nSecond, we\u2019ve begun seeing the warning signs of the INVERTED YEILD CURVE - which, according to just about every article out there, the inverted yield curve has historically been associated with a high likelihood of upcoming recession. \n\nThird, we have the tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding what may or may not happen. And when it comes to investments, the ONE thing all investors dislike is UNCERTAINTY. When people are UNCERTAIN, they don\u2019t invest, they hold cash\u2026and that causes stock prices to fall.\n\nAnd fourth\u2026we\u2019re seeing a slow down in nearly all markets. \n\nHere\u2019s what I think is going to happen\u2026\nFirst, I\u2019ve noticed QUITE a lot of what I call \u201cgamblers fallacy.\u201d This is the expectation that the market will drop, JUST because we\u2019ve been in the longest bull market in HISTORY and that means it\u2019s \u201coverdue\u201d and more likely to happen. \n\nSecond, I believe that a lot of our \u201cRecession Talk\u201d is already SOMEWHAT factored into the price. Think of all the people NOT investing right now because they want to wait for lower prices\u2026that is, in itself, self fulfilling and lowering prices. \n\nAnd third\u2026no one, including myself, knows whats going to happen. No ONE. \n\nAnd fourth, you have so many false news articles designed to APPEAR like credible new sources so they get pumped through Facebook and Blogs for the sole purpose of manipulating you into buying their products. \n\nWell here\u2019s the reality: \n\nFirst, NO ONE can predict when a recession will happen. We\u2019ve been seeing these articles since 2013 from people who claim the recession is coming any month now. It\u2019s never ending. You\u2019ll read about this one expert predicting something, then another expert predicting something else, and they keep repeating themselves until eventually, one of them is right. Then they use that credibility of being right ONCE to propel them into the next opportunity. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s important you PREPARE for a recession in ways you can CONTROL:\nFirst, you CAN control whether or not you keep a 3-6 month fund in the event you lose your job or something unexpected comes up. This is absolutely ESSENTIAL for you to do. \n\nSecond, you CAN control whether or not to have too many outstanding debts that might need to be paid down. If you\u2019re over leveraged, or if you have high interest debt, it\u2019s in your best interest to pay those off to free up cashflow in the event of a downturn. \n\nThird, you CAN control how much you spend\u2026if you\u2019re spending is too high, it\u2019s important to cut those back so that you can save more money to invest. \n\nAnd when you DO invest, invest long term. Ideally, these are investments you should plan to keep 10-20 years. For me, I see lower prices as an opportunity. And to alleviate some of these concerns, you don\u2019t need to just drop ALL of your money in the market at once\u2026buy a small amount each and every month. This way, if the price goes down..you\u2019re buying in cheaper and cheaper over time. If it goes up, you\u2019re buying in little bit little\u2026and anytime when it comes to investing, slow and steady wins the race. This isn\u2019t about making an immediate 10% profit in a month\u2026this is about investing for your future in a slow, stable way where you don\u2019t feel stressed whether the market goes up or down. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 80k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-02-06T23:30:02Z","tags":["stock market","stock market investing","stock market recession","stock market drop","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estae","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","investing strategies","investing strategies 2019","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income investing","how to make money","how to make money online","stock market news","stock market today","investing for beginners"],"title":"How To Prepare For The 2020 Recession","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/suvpM843iJ8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/suvpM843iJ8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/suvpM843iJ8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/suvpM843iJ8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/suvpM843iJ8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M16S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3453","dislikeCount":"1402","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"27288","viewCount":"658922"}},{"id":"0O8yr3WheuE","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s how you can manage your money like the 1%, and how you can follow this simple formula to Financial Independence - Enjoy!

From doing this, you can determine if you\u2019re spending money on things that don\u2019t matter, if you\u2019re making impulse purchases, or if you\u2019re just otherwise wasting money without even realizing it. When you do this, you will find a way to reduce spending without missing anything\u2026you can likely save about 10% of your income just by tracking your expenses, and then reducing spending on the things you don\u2019t even realize. \n\nStep Two: Creating a Rainy Day Fund. \nEvery single wealthy person I know has a rainy day fund of AT LEAST 3-6 months worth of expenses. This means that you already know, from tracking your expenses, how much you need to spend every month to live\u2026now save up 3-6 times that amount, in cash. You do not spend this money, EVER, unless you absolutely need to. \n\nStep Three: Take advantage of employer sponsored retirement plan matching.\nThis means that if your employer offers a 401k match\u2026ALWAYS TAKE IT. THIS IS FREE, GUARANTEED MONEY. There is no other investment in the history of the world that will give you a risk free, guaranteed 100% return on your money like an employer match. And if you\u2019re self employed, you can make your own employer contributions with a SEP 401K\u2026google that, because that\u2019s a great way to reduce your taxes. \n\nStep Four: Pay off high interest rate debt.\nThis means that if you have any outstanding debt over a 5% interest rate, begin PAYING THIS OFF NOW after you have your rainy day fund, and after you\u2019ve got your free employer match. When it comes to paying off debt, there are two strategies to go about this: \n\nThe first is called the avalanche method, and mathematically, this should leave you with the most money left over as possible. This means you should start paying off the highest interest rate debt you have first, and then once that\u2019s paid off, you to go the next highest interest rate\u2026until it\u2019s all paid off. \n\nThe second method is the Dave Ramsey approach, and that\u2019s called the snowball method. This means you pay off the smallest balance, first, regardless of interest rates, and then move up to the next largest balance\u2026and the next largest, until you leave the biggest balance for last. The downside, of course, is that you likely end up paying more money in interest and that costs you more in the long run - but if doing this means you pay off debt, I\u2019m all for it. As long as long as you pay off high interest debt.\n\nStep Five: Invest in yourself.\nThis could be buying books, this could be learning a new skill, this could be investing back into your business\u2026self education, in my opinion, is absolutely vital at this stage. If you\u2019re in a position RIGHT NOW where you\u2019ve already done as much as you can, and you don\u2019t have any money left over after doing all of this..then there\u2019s no way around it, you\u2019ve gotta work to increase your income. \n\nStep Six: Invest in a Roth IRA.\nThis is an account that allows you to invest your after-tax money, and when you\u2019re 60, all the profit you make in that account is completely TAX FREE\u2026this means that you can get decades of investment growth and compound interest working on your side that you don\u2019t have to pay tax on. And when it comes to growing your wealth, having this available to you is absolutely priceless\u2026watch this:\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/z-53ZTJmDUA\n\nStep Seven: Invest in Taxable Accounts \/ Anything Else.\nThis means that you have your brokerage account where you just trade stocks in, maybe you buy some real estate, maybe you spend some money starting a business\u2026from this point on, it\u2019s really about just doing what you can to increase your income even further and build up your net worth. \n\nThe hardest part about doing all of this, and managing your money like the 1%, is just starting. And it all starts right here, at step number one. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-02-04T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to manage your money","personal finance","how to manage your money like the rich","how to manage your money as a teenager","how to manage your money and save","how to manage your money in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to make passive income","how to invest in stocks for beginners","personal finance 101","personal finance tips","personal finance basics","how to save money","how to save money with low income","how to save for a house"],"title":"How To Manage Your Money Like The 1%","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0O8yr3WheuE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0O8yr3WheuE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0O8yr3WheuE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0O8yr3WheuE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/0O8yr3WheuE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3185","dislikeCount":"783","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"49025","viewCount":"959214"}},{"id":"DPaHXjET38U","snippet":{"description":"Remember the saying \u201cCash is king?\u201d Well, I think we\u2019re slowly entering an era where cash no longer has quite the power and leverage it once used to have\u2026here\u2019s why. Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nGET THE MERCH: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nHere\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t pay with Debit or Cash\u2026and instead, pay for everything with a credit card:\n\nThe first reason you should put everything on a credit card is for security. When you pay for something with cash, the cash is gone from your hands as soon as you spend it\u2026and if you lose that cash, it\u2019s also gone. Similar with a debt card - when you use a debit card, you\u2019re giving the entire world direct line to your ACTUAL money. Every time you use it, at an ATM or when making a purchase, you\u2019re pretty much pulling your cash directly out of your checking account.\n\nWith a credit card, on the other hard, you accrue a balance on that card, and then you pay it down by the time it\u2019s due. NONE of your actual money is used\u2026it\u2019s like being able to use someone else money for 60 days, completely free, and at the end of that 60 days, you pay that person back from what you\u2019ve spent. The credit card becomes the BUFFER between what you buy, and your money. \n\nThe second reason you should put everything on a credit card is PURCHASE PROTECTION. Many credit cards offer this as a perk of using their service\u2026and this should be reason enough for you to start charging everything on your credit card. \n\nFirst, we have credit cards that offer purchase protection - this means that the credit card company will insure your item for 90-120 days in the event of damage \n\nSecond, we have credit cards that offer price protection\u2026this means that if you buy something, and then find it CHEAPER within usually 90 days, you can submit the cheaper price to the credit card company and they will CREDIT YOU BACK THE DIFFERENCE.\n\nAnd third, we have return protection\u2026this means that if you buy something and for whatever reason decided to return it, if the merchant won\u2019t accept a return or issue a refund, your credit card will cover you and accept the return on the merchants behalf, then they\u2019ll just reimburse you directly.\n\nFourth: extended warranty. Many credit cards will extend the manufactures warranty of an item by matching it for up to an extra year. \n\nNext, we get my total favorite reason to use credit cards over paying with cash or debit\u2026and that\u2019s REWARDS. Just use the credit card for your normal spending and rack up free travel, free hotels, and free cash back in your pocket\u2026all for deciding to use a credit card over cash. This is also known as credit card churning. \n\nAnd finally\u2026the last reason to use a credit card Is to boost your credit score and credit utilization. In the United States, your credit score is a huge factor in determining whether or not you can get a loan to buy a house, car, or any other purchase you want to finance\u2026it also determines what interest rate you pay, and whether or not you get a low interest rate, or a high interest rate. \n\nSo I\u2019d like to think ALL of those reasons I just mentioned are fairly compelling just to use a credit card for EVERYTHING, and to ditch the debit card and cash altogether.\n\nHowever: \nYou should NOT use credit cards to rack up debt IF you don\u2019t have the money to pay it off, in full, when it\u2019s due. You should never pay a single penny in interest, you should never increase your spending just because the money isn\u2019t immediately taken out of your account, and you should have the cash available to pay it off, in full, at all times. \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFavorite Credit Cards:\nChase Ink 100k Bonus Point Offer -\u00a0https:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nAmerican Express Platinum -\u00a0http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASOxHd?XLINK=MYCP","publishedAt":"2019-02-01T23:30:01Z","tags":["credit card","credit card debt","how to increase your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit limit","how to increase your credit score 100pts","credit card churning","debit card vs credit card","debit card for teenagers","paying with cash only","paying with cash app","credit card 101","how to get a credit score","credit cards for beginners","credit card churning explained","credit vs debit","robinhood","robinhood bank account","american express"],"title":"DON\u2019T PAY with Cash or Debit!!

Not that I think it won\u2019t do well for Apple and their customer base, but specifically as a credit card\u2026they missed so many amazing opportunities to make this a home-run card that everyone should get.\n\nIn terms of usefulness and practicality, the credit card is really just OK. And I have a feeling, from Apple\u2019s perspective, that\u2019s what they wanted to go for all along. It\u2019s a credit card that\u2019s created for mass appeal, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s not built to be the best credit card out there, it isn\u2019t meant to offer crazy competitive rewards to compete with American Express or the Chase Sapphire\u2026it\u2019s JUST meant to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible, who loves Apple, and wants something somewhat unique - which is what they\u2019ll get with a titanium laser etched card without numbers on it. \n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t be surprised when this soon becomes the new trend among credit cards, to issue blank cards without numbers on them. When it comes to something unique or special - this is really what I think this credit card has going for it. It\u2019s a novelty, but at the same time, it\u2019s kinda cool and gets attention. And it costs nothing, with 1-3% cash back, which is decent. So for that, I\u2019ll give it to apple. \n\nLike I said, for MOST people, this card will be perfect for them - Apple isn\u2019t going after the people who really maximize rewards, and try to squeeze the most value from everything they do. \n\nApple seems like they were aiming to make something that\u2019s probably a little better than what the AVERAGE person is currently getting with their random crappy credit cards, and that\u2019s their market - and arguably, THAT market is much bigger to go after than the people like me and most of you watching who just want crazy good benefits and rewards, and just want the best of the best. \n\nSo in terms of market share, I have no doubt Apple will be successful with these cards, and many people will get it ONLY because it\u2019s apple, only because it\u2019s metal, and only because it\u2019s got a \u201ctrend\u201d factor to it. \n\nWith that said, I DO think Apple missed a huge opportunity to offer SOME type of sign-up bonus with this card to attract an even larger audience.\n\nTHIS was their golden opportunity to get people into a frenzy over getting this card who wouldn\u2019t have ordinarily applied. If they want a TON of new customers, just offer a few hundred dollars back on your first $2000 spent. If they had done that, I would\u2019ve gone for it - that way I can justify having a hard inquiry on my credit report.\n\nSo would I recommend this card for anyone watching?\n\nYes. It\u2019s a no fee card, zero transaction fees, 1-3% cash back, and it\u2019s titanium without numbers on it. To me, this card isn\u2019t bad - I have nothing against it, and it\u2019s absolutely BETTER than most of the other generic crap out there. \n\nHowever, there are many BETTER credit cards than this - like the Citi Double Cash Rewards Card - that give you a much more broad 2% cash back, without an annual fee, while also offering extended warranty protection. Or, the Discover Cash Back which offers 5% cash back on revolving categories. \n\nSo if your goal is maximizing rewards and going for the best credit card possible, the apple card isn\u2019t it. They missed the mark on that one. \n\nHowever, if your goal is just getting a basic, no fee card that you can enjoy and use - and you don\u2019t care about getting the highest value all the time - then it\u2019s good. And this is definitely the biggest demographic out there, who apple plans to market to. They understand the average audience an they\u2019re making a mass market card for most people.  \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-26T22:30:01Z","tags":["Apple","Apple Credit Card","Apple Credit Card 2019","apple credit card review","apple credit card reveal","apple credit card update","credit card review","credit card","best credit card","apple credit card news","apple news","apple predictions","apple rumors","credit card churning","how to increase your credit score","credit score explained","cash back credit card","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit score 100 pts","credit score increase"],"title":"Why I won't be getting the Apple Credit Card...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OQiZrybePYc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OQiZrybePYc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OQiZrybePYc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OQiZrybePYc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/OQiZrybePYc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6708","dislikeCount":"3583","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"45819","viewCount":"1480349"}},{"id":"R6EkLkisyOI","snippet":{"description":"The Inverted Yield Curve: Lets discuss what this means, why it\u2019s important, and if this could predict a recession.

This is because, long term, you might not know where the markets are heading, you aren\u2019t sure of inflation, and there\u2019s more to go wrong, in a sense. So because of that, you should be compensated a little more for the LONGER you invest. \n\nHowever, right now, things are quite the opposite: you can get a higher return investing your money in short term bonds for just 3 months\u2026than you can investing your money in long term bonds for 10 years. That is what\u2019s meant by the yield curve INVERTING.\n\nAll you need to know is that when this happens, it\u2019s used as an indicator that a recession is soon to come. This is because an inverted yield curve has correctly signaled nine recessions since 1955, with only one false positive in the 1960\u2019s.\nhttps:\/\/www.frbsf.org\/economic-research\/publications\/economic-letter\/2018\/march\/economic-forecasts-with-yield-curve\/\n\nNow\u2026looking back all the way back to the 1960\u2019s, when the 3 month \/ 10 year yield inverts for more than 10 days, it took an AVERAGE of 311 days from there to actually enter a recession. And once in a recession, it lasted - on average - of 17.5 months. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/the-yield-curve-inverted-here-are-5-things-investors-need-to-know-2019-03-22\nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cameronkeng\/2018\/10\/23\/recession-is-overdue-by-4-5-years-heres-how-to-prepare\/#700a7f4940d8\n\nSo here\u2019s what this means, and what you should do about it. \n\nYes, this has predicted the last 9 recessions with one false positive\u2026but this doesn\u2019t ALWAYS mean it will be the case with 100% certainty, and if it IS right, we still don\u2019t know how the market will behave and where the market will end its highs and lows. A recession could happen now, or it could happen in a year from now - the markets could go up another 15% before they decline, or they can go down 10% tomorrow\u2026.no one can predict it.\n\nMost of this data we get is seen AFTER it\u2019s already happened, so we can\u2019t be completely sure what will happen in the near future to act on it with reasonable accuracy. \n\nThis leads me to my own thoughts and my own advice\u2026and this is how I basically run my entire life:\nFocus on the things you can directly control, and ignore the things you can\u2019t.\n\nBy focusing on what you CAN control, and disregarding everything you can\u2019t\u2026you give yourself MUCH greater power to make the most of opportunities, LONG TERM, without concerning yourself about what the markets may or may not do in the short term. \n\nIf the markets go down - fine, that\u2019s just part of the market cycle. Use that as an opportunity to continue buying at lower prices, knowing that long term, you\u2019ll be ok. \n\nIf the markets continue going up - fine, that means your current investments are also going up in price.\n\nIt\u2019s great to be aware of economics and what drives business, but at the end of the day, focus on what you can control and make sure you\u2019re not in a position where you\u2019ll be hurt if prices fall, so you can ride it out until it recovers. \n\nAnd understand that even IN a recession, even WHEN prices drop - because they will at some point - that those are often the best opportunities to take advantage of. It should be something to embrace, not something to fear. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-25T22:30:00Z","tags":["inverted yield curve","inverted yield curve explained","inverted yield curve recession","inverted yield curve 2019","recession 2019","recession 2020","stock market decline","stock market drop","stock market investing","stock investing","stock investing for beginners","stock investing strategies","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","how to make money online","how to make passive income","passive income explained","passive income ideas"],"title":"Beware: The Inverted Yield Curve","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R6EkLkisyOI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R6EkLkisyOI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R6EkLkisyOI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R6EkLkisyOI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R6EkLkisyOI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"915","dislikeCount":"119","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"4920","viewCount":"66632"}},{"id":"5MppmjJ-HNk","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s a topic that\u2019s been coming up a LOT recently, and this is an extremely confusing decision:  What\u2019s better to invest in - Roth IRA or a Traditional 401k? Here\u2019s my thoughts, enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nRoth IRA vs 401K Calculator: https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/calculators\/retirement\/401-k-or-roth-ira-calculator.aspx\n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nSo lets first start with some background on the almighty Roth IRA: \nFirst, like I just mentioned, all of the profit generated in this account is tax free after the age of 59.5. That could save you a LOT of money by the time you retire, especially if you begin investing in this early on. \n\nSecond, with a Roth IRA, you can withdraw whatever money you contribute to this account, at any time, tax free, without paying any penalties. \n\nHowever, here are the downsides:\nFirst, with a Roth IRA, you contribute POST TAX MONEY - this means the money that\u2019s left over after you\u2019ve already your paid taxes on it. And as we all know, the money you have left over AFTER taxes is a LOT smaller than before the taxes were taken away\u2026this means you\u2019ll have LESS of your money to invest upfront, all things considered.\n\nSecond, if you want to withdraw your PROFIT from this account before the age of 59.5, you\u2019ll be subject to a 10% penalty, and you\u2019ll have to pay normal taxes on that profit. \n\nThird, the contribution limit for a Roth IRA is capped at $6000\u2026so if you want to contribute more than this, well, you can\u2019t. \n\nBut how does this all compare to the Traditional 401k?\n\nWell, the 401k is an employer sponsored retirement account where you contribute PRE TAX money\u2026meaning you won\u2019t pay any taxes on the money you invest in this account. Now because you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on the money you contribute, you have even MORE money left over to invest instead of paying it to the IRS, allowing that extra money you saved in taxes to make YOU even more money. \n\nPros of a Traditional 401k:\nYou contribute pre-tax money, meaning you don\u2019t pay taxes on the money you put in this account, and can be a huge tax deduction. \n\nSecondly, you can contribute up to $19,000 per year in a 401k\u2026that\u2019s  more than 3x HIGHER than you can contribute to a Roth IRA. \n\nThird, some employers offer a 401k employer match - which means they actually match your contribution, dollar for dollar\n\nDownsides to the traditional 401k:\n\nThe first is that you\u2019ll end up paying taxes on your money when you begin withdrawing it from your account after the age of 59.5. With a 401k, you\u2019re basically saving money on taxes NOW so you have more to invest upfront.\n\nSecondly, if you want to withdraw the money prior to the age of 59.5 for anything other than financial hardship, you\u2019ll be subject to paying a 10% penalty on your money and you\u2019ll owe taxes as though this money is ORDINARY INCOME.\n\nThird, you\u2019ll be forced to begin withdrawing your money at the age of 70 1\/2\u2026and for some people who prefer to continue saving it and letting it grow, well\u2026you can\u2019t. \n\nAnd the right mix is - in my opinion - a slight balance between the two. I still contribute a bit to my traditional 401k just to hedge my future options, even if I have no idea if it\u2019ll be the smart choice in the future\u2026again, JUST IN CASE. I also go heavy on the Roth option, too, because I know it\u2019ll be tax free in the future, and I don\u2019t have to question what future tax rates may or may not be. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-22T22:30:00Z","tags":["traditional 401k vs roth ira","traditional 401k","401k for dummies","401k vs roth ira","401k investing","401k loan","401k vs roth 401k","401k dave ramsey","roth ira","roth ira explained","roth ira vs traditional ira","roth ira dave ramsey","roth ira investing","vanguard index funds","vanguard index funds for beginners","how to invest in stocks","retirement account","early retirement","financial independence","retire early","how to make passive income","passive income ideas"],"title":"Becoming a Millionaire: Roth IRA vs 401K (What makes the MOST PROFIT)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5MppmjJ-HNk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5MppmjJ-HNk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5MppmjJ-HNk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5MppmjJ-HNk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5MppmjJ-HNk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M7S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3473","dislikeCount":"1074","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"52838","viewCount":"1039045"}},{"id":"LFbX3eqH0As","snippet":{"description":"Lets go over some of my favorite side hustles that pretty much ANYONE can do, In their spare time, from home, to make an extra $50-$1000 per month. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF (Limited Time Only)\n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/activity.webull.com\/landing\/index.html?cs=a&s=GrahamS\n\nComica Wireless Mic: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2Ew7rZZ\nNicolas Cage Pillowcase: https:\/\/amzn.to\/2tPoTDZ\n\nFirst Side Job: Focus Groups.\nI\u2019d used to do these every other week, typically schedule it in the late evening or early morning, and they\u2019d pay anywhere from $50-$500 for 1-3 hours of your time. To do this, I went to FocusPointeGlobal .com, and then I\u2019d fill out any applications they would email to me. I probably got selected for 1 out of every 5, and they were honestly pretty fun to do. \n\nSecond Side Hustle: Credit Card Churning\nMany credit cards will offer what\u2019s called a sign up bonus. This means when you go and apply for the card, then meet the minimum spending on that card in the first few months, they\u2019ll give you a certain number of points. Those points are them redeemable for free travel, free hotels, or cash back. So all I do is sign up for the card, meet the minimum spending requirement for money I was going to be spending ANYWAY, then just enjoy the free travel. \n\nHow to do this: https:\/\/youtu.be\/IU6SbKEbyRo\n\nThird Side Hustle: Bank Account Churning\nThis is EXACTLY like credit card churning, except with bank account churning, they\u2019ll offer you a sign-up bonus for opening a new checking or savings account. The good thing about this option is that these offers usually come up every few weeks, so as long as you have some savings you don\u2019t mind moving around from bank to bank, you can easily make some extra money literally working from your bed, in the time it takes you to watch a full ad on youtube. \n\nNow because this takes a little more work to sign up for and keep track of, I don\u2019t recommend going for ALL of them at once\u2026 but doing one every other month or so with the spare cash you have lying around could be a great way to make some extra side money with about 15-20 minutes worth of work! \n\nFourth Side Hustle: Affiliate Marketing\nAnd the easiest way to do this is through the amazon affiliate program, which anyone can sign up for and use. You can make videos here on youtube reviewing your favorite products, or things that you use on a daily basis, and then make a small commission each time someone buys through your link. \n\nIn addition to that, there are so many other products out there that pay affiliate commissions. Ronbinhood, the stock trading app, is one of them - you can make up to $500 for any referrals who use your link. Or WeBull pays up to $1000 for anyone you get to sign up. There are HUNDREDS of different options out there. But I am absolutely adamant that YouTube is such a great way to reach an audience, completely free, entirely organically, who you can share your thoughts with and get paid. And this is something you can do any time of the day, as much as you want, or as little as you want, you are your own boss. Learn how to do this: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv\n\nFifth: Teaching \/ Tutoring \/ Consulting\nTo do this, you need to have some type of skill that you can articulate and teach to someone else\u2026then, one of the BEST ways to start doing this is through your own network - ask through friends and family if they know anyone who might need your services. You can also post ads through Craigslist, or post on college bulletin boards. The good news is that word of mouth works REALLY quickly once you get a small group of students who are happy - you bet they\u2019ll tell their friends, and their friends will tell their friends, and it will grow over time. This could be a really great way to make an extra $20-$50 per hour around your own schedule. \n\nSixth: Airbnb\nThis is a little more time intensive, BUT the payout can be much, much greater. I know several people who rent out their spare bedrooms around Los Angeles and many of them can make an extra $100 PER DAY with very minimal work. And once this gets up and running and you get a backlog of positive reviews, it could be a GREAT side hustle to make some relatively passive income around your schedule. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-20T22:30:02Z","tags":["best side hustles","best side hustles 2019","best side hustles for college students","best side jobs to make extra money","best side jobs","best side jobs 2019","best side jobs for students","how to make money online","how to make money on youtube","how to make passive income","credit card churning","bank account churning","airbnb","focus groups","focus groups for money","how to make money part time","how to make money as a teenager","how to invest","make money from home"],"title":"The 6 BEST Side Hustles That Pay $20-$200 Per Hour","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LFbX3eqH0As\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LFbX3eqH0As\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LFbX3eqH0As\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LFbX3eqH0As\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LFbX3eqH0As\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M1S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3062","dislikeCount":"1963","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"91867","viewCount":"1722376"}},{"id":"1JlUwhk9tXw","snippet":{"description":"Building your credit is easily one of THE most important things you can do to improve your financial future. However, these 5 common mistakes will RUIN your credit score - this is how to avoid it. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF (Limited Time Only)\n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nFirst: Missing a payment or by paying it off late. \nThis is probably the most detrimental mistake you could make, because your payment-history makes up 35% of your overall credit score. And what\u2019s even worse, is that your payment history is stays on your credit report for up to seven years. \n\nSo when it comes to preventing this from happening, here are two things I always do:\nFirst, I ALWAYS make sure to have auto-pay enabled to make the minimum payment. This way, NO MATTER WHAT, I\u2019ll always at LEAST pay off the minimum amount I owe, on time. \n\nSecond, I use a combination of Mint.com and CreditKarma.com to keep track of all my credit cards and credit card balances every few weeks. If I see something with a balance, I\u2019ll always just go in and pay it off immediately so I don\u2019t forget about doing it later. This usually takes a few minutes every other week to manage, it\u2019s fairly simple. \n\nSecond: Maxing out your credit card \nThis is because 30% of your credit score is calculated by what\u2019s called your credit utilization - this is the amount of credit you have available to you, versus how much of it you actually use. So when it comes to avoiding this mistake, thankfully it\u2019s fairly easy to do in a few steps:\n\nFirst, try to keep your credit utilization under 30%. This means for every $1000 of credit that you\u2019re given, you keep a balance under $300 at all times.\nThe second thing you can do, IF you need to make larger one-time purchases on your credit card, is pay it off as soon as you exceed 30%. \n\nThird strategy I\u2019ve used is to have MULTIPLE lines of credit so that it lowers the overall credit utilization. \n\nBut\u2026the GOOD news with this is that even if you DO max out your credit card\u2026your drop in credit score is only temporary until you pay it off!\n\nThird: Opening up too much credit, too quickly\nEach time you apply for new credit, it\u2019s called a \u201chard inquiry\u201d - which just means that a third party has run your credit, indicating you\u2019ve applied for a loan. Each time this happens, it\u2019ll lower your credit score about 3-5 points\u2026and this affects your credit score for the next 6 months. \n\nOn one hand, the more credit cards you have, generally the more diverse your credit history is, and because of that, the HIGHER your score will be - LONG TERM. In the short term, however, the more cards you apply for at once, the higher risk you become to lenders, and because of that, the LOWER the score you\u2019ll have. \n\nSo when it comes to this, here is my advice:\nIf you\u2019re planning to buy a house or car in the next 6-8 months, or you plan to finance any large upcoming purchases, DO NOT open up new lines of credit. It\u2019s just too risky and if you lower your score at a time where you need it the most, it could be detrimental to your loan!\n\nFourth: Closing an old credit card. \nThis is because the AVERAGE length of your credit history makes up 15% of your overall credit score, so when you cancel an old credit line, you inadvertently also lower the AVERAGE age of your credit. This is why It\u2019s important to ALWAYS keep your oldest credit accounts active, even if you never use them - just because this weighs down your average account age to show it\u2019s been open longer. \n\nFifth: Not having any credit at all!\nIf you don\u2019t have a credit score, you\u2019re an \u201cunknown\u201d to lenders because your entire credit score is NOTHING\u2026and because of that, no lender will ever loan you money for a house, or a car, or anything else you might want to finance. If this is you, learn from my mistake and get SOME type of credit card.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-18T22:30:00Z","tags":["credit score","credit report","credit score increase","credit score explained","credit score 101","credit score to buy a house","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit score 100 poitns","how to increase your credit limit","credit score tips","Credit Score mistakes","how to invest","how to build wealth","financial independence","financial independence retire early","credit report 101","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","how to invest in stocks"],"title":"5 Mistakes that RUIN your Credit Score","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1JlUwhk9tXw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1JlUwhk9tXw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1JlUwhk9tXw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1JlUwhk9tXw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1JlUwhk9tXw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M31S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1239","dislikeCount":"110","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11751","viewCount":"173885"}},{"id":"pSz7DcrE9SE","snippet":{"description":"These are the exact strategies I used to accumulate $4 million in real estate in just 7 years, and exactly how you can make money renting properties - enjoy!

In real estate, it\u2019s very well possible to find a property worth $100,000 - and buy it for $80,000. To you, that\u2019s an extra $20,000 worth of value for just buying the home in the first place. \n\nStep two: Fix it up to increase profits. \nWith every property I purchased, I\u2019ve found a way to fix it up to INCREASE the value\u2026real estate investing gives you the full control to fully analyze a deal and determine how much money is to be made, EVEN BEFORE YOU BUY IT. And when doing this, it all comes down to understanding value and how estimating how much it\u2019ll be worth with the renovations you do.\n\nStep three: Leverage your money\nNow when it comes to buying something, the good news is that YOU don\u2019t even need to use all of your own money\u2026you borrow most of it from someone else, instead! AND THE INTEREST YOU PAY IS DEDUCTIBLE AGAINST YOUR RENTAL INCOME!\n\nStep four: long term appreciation\nOver the long term, your property should go up in value as demand increases\u2026and this means your property is worth MORE than you bought it for. BUT, because your loan amount stays the same - this means you \u201cprofit\u201d the difference. \n\n\nStep five: CASHFLOW\nYou can invest your money and get paid back profit every single month as your tenant pays you rent. This was also the reason I started investing in real estate in the first place\u2026 I just wanted a stable income I didn\u2019t have to actively work for, and I wanted it to be fairly passive\u2026and real estate was perfect for this. \nThe more money you have invested in real estate, the more cashflow you get, the more cashflow you get, the more real estate you can get, which means the more cashflow you get. It\u2019s quite nice. \n\nStep Six: Depreciation \nThis is a tax-loss strategy where you can depreciate the cost of the property over 27.5 years against your rental income to show on paper that you\u2019re taking a loss, even though you make money. \nThis is something that you can\u2019t really do with any other asset out there, and this is why so many large investors prefer to put their money in real estate over just about anything else. \n\nStep Seven: 1031 Exchange\nThis is when you can sell your property, and then roll that money into ANOTHER property and avoid paying taxes on profit. Another tax-avoidance option is to take advantage of the Home Sale Tax Exclusion. This means that if you live in a home as a PRIMARY residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years, you\u2019re tax exempt from the first $250,000 worth of PROFIT as a single person, or $500,000 if you\u2019re married. \n\nStep Eight: Cash out refinance or HELOC\nA HELOC is basically like using your home as a credit card\u2026if you want to use $25,000 to go and buy a model 3 Tesla, you can \u201cborrow\u201d from your house and then pay it back.

Have you ever been curious how much MORE you can make if you\u2019re just driving a Lamborghini? Well, I found out.\n\nA year ago, I created a program called \u201cThe Real Estate Agent Academy,\u201d which teaches real estate agents how to grow their business and make more money. And guess what\u2026I have never run ads to sell that program.\n\nBut, that left me wondering\u2026.what would happen if I ran an ad on YouTube to promote my product, and would that increase my sales? Even more so\u2026what if I had a bright yellow Lamborghini Huracan Spyder. Would that give viewers the extra inspiration to buy my product so they, too, can get a Lamborghini?\n\nSo I tested it out. \n\nIn total, I spent $481.48 running a the YouTube Lamborghini ad, that brought me 11,729 views - and of those people, 22% watched the ad. In terms of sales numbers, though, it actually was fairly impressive - $2,970 in gross sales, in 48 hours. That left me with a net profit of $2488.52, in 2 days. \n\nBut how much of this was actually due to the Lamborghini? \n\nTest 2: Instead of having a flashy Lamborghini in the background, I was just going to be myself and film an honest video. \n\nI spent just $66.99 on running the second ad for 24 hours. Because I decided to go with a low budget, mostly because I was concerned more people would get angry and unsubscribe, the video only reached 2660 views. Of those 2660 views, 30% of people watched the ad - that was 36% HIGHER than with the Yellow Lamborghini. \n\nBut here\u2019s where the surprising results come in - even though I only spent $66.99 and that video only got 2660 views...that ad generated $2376 in TOTAL SALES, in 24 hours, for a net profit of $2309.01. \n\nWith the Lamborghini ad, each view I received made a net profit of 21 cents. This means for every $1 I spent in ads with a Lamborghini, I made $6 back. That\u2019s a 600% ROI\u2026which sounds impressive, until you hear this. \n\nWith the non Lamborghini ad, each view I received made a net profit of 86 cents. This means for every $1 I spent with ads, WITHOUT a Lamborghini, I made $35 back\u2026that\u2019s a 3500% ROI. \n\nThis test isn\u2019t complete because there was one flaw with these ads that I soon realized: even though these sales numbers are impressive, in the ad, I discounted my program by $200 to give an incentive to make the sale, which works out to be nearly 40% off - and at that price, I felt like it would naturally just sell itself, even without running an ad.\n\nSo I had to compare this with ONE more test: how much would I sell offering $200 off, but WITHOUT spending a single dollar on advertising? Well, look no further than Instagram.\n\nSo how effective was a quick, to the point, swipe up story on instagram, discounting the program $200, compared to an ad on YouTube offering the same discount? Or an ad on YouTube with a flashy Yellow Lamborghini in the background? \n\nIn 24 hours, with $0 ad spend, that swipe-up instagram story generated $6831 in sales, organically. \n\nBut it was through this experience, that I realized the best way to sell a product isn\u2019t through fancy advertisements, it isn\u2019t through expensive cars, and it isn\u2019t through designer props. Instead, it\u2019s by building an organic audience from the foundation of trust, value, honesty, and total transparency - once that happens, products and services sell themselves. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-13T22:30:01Z","tags":["Lamborghini","Lamborghini Huracan","How to make money online","how to make money on youtube","how to make money as a teenager","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income investments","lamborghini youtube ad","youtube ads","best way to make money","income breakdown","investing strategies","how to invest","how to make 100 per day","how to make 100 per day online","how to make 1000 in a week","how to make passive income online","graham stephan","Lamborghin Huracan Spyder"],"title":"I got a Lamborghini for a Youtube Ad","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPc17o8ZKKo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPc17o8ZKKo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPc17o8ZKKo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPc17o8ZKKo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPc17o8ZKKo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M1S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3631","dislikeCount":"571","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"20295","viewCount":"488375"}},{"id":"d5TlL_Wqqdo","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered why mansions have SO MANY more bathrooms than bedrooms? Do wealthy people use bathrooms more than the rest of us, or is there actually a reason behind this? Here\u2019s why. Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nThe first reason why these homes have so many bathrooms is for future re-sale value. If a large home has a study, office, or other large room with a bathroom in it - it becomes MUCH easier for a future buyer to potentially use that room as a bedroom in the future. It also becomes that much easier to turn that re-purposed bedroom back into its original use if you no longer needed it as a bedroom. \n\nYou\u2019ll also find that, in larger homes, the largest bedrooms have separate, dual bathrooms - for example, the master bedroom might have two bathrooms. Then, add to the fact that many of these 20,000 square foot homes have several master suites throughout the home - and each of those suites have 2 additional bathrooms\u2026the bathroom count starts adding up very quickly.\n\nBut beyond that, the bathroom count of a mansion really has more to do with the size of the property - not with the number of bedrooms it has. In large homes, typically over 10,000 square feet, if you need to use the bathroom, it should be located in a convenient to reach location. So for this reason, bathrooms tend to be placed strategically around the home to accommodate whenever the moment strikes.\n\nAnd when it comes to bathroom placement, bathrooms are typically built in the areas where you\u2019re likely to spend the most amount of time - such as nearby the living room, nearby the kitchen, nearby the pool, or nearby any bonus or media rooms. That way a bathroom is always within a short distance when you need it the most. \n\nIn addition to that, you\u2019ll typically have all other rooms containing their own bathroom - such as a gym, basketball court, cabana, media room, or whatever else you can think of. And in most fine estates, pools almost always have their own dedicated bathrooms.\n\nAnd the bathrooms don\u2019t stop there - most large estates employ staff. They have gardeners, house managers, house cleaners, and pool keepers\u2026and, you guessed it, those people all need bathrooms. So to accommodate this, homes of a large magnitude will typically have a separate staff quarters with their own bathrooms, as well. \n\nAnd finally, owners of large homes typically host lots of events - and when you host events, you don\u2019t want the guests to have to walk into a bedroom or media room to use a bathroom, and you also don\u2019t want them waiting in line for the only bathroom on the main entertaining level. So in order to prevent this ahead of time, several bathrooms are typically placed throughout the main levels which are used for entertaining. \n\nAnd that\u2019s why mansion have so many bedrooms, it\u2019s done this way for convenience, future resale value, and added privacy for both the guests and residents. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-11T22:30:00Z","tags":["why do mansions have so many bathrooms","mansion tour","mansion tour beverly hills","mansion tour california","mansion tour 90210","mansion tour las vegas","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategy","how to invest in real estate","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income online","home tour","bathroom renovation","bathroom remodeling","investing in real estate","how to invest","graham stephan","ryan serhant"],"title":"Ever wondered why Mansions have SO MANY Bathrooms?

Here\u2019s why - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF (Limited Time Only)\n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nWhat IS an index fund? \nAn index fund is basically just a group of investments that you can invest your money into, and then you\u2019ll own a small percentage of the entire thing. Index funds track the entire market as a whole, rather than one specific stock. \n\nWhy Invest in an Index Fund: They have very low fees.\nThis is because indexes are very simple to put together, very simple to manage, there isn\u2019t much overhead, and those savings get passed on to you. This is also what\u2019s known as a PASSIVELY managed fund. You\u2019re getting an entire portfolio of stocks that automatically gets balanced and adjusted over time, without doing any work, and you pay as low as 0.04% annually.\n\nThis is the opposite of a MUTUAL FUND, which employs professional stock pickers who aim to generate market-beating performance. However, the additional overhead expense associated with this, as well as the fees incurred by buying and selling, ultimately gets passed on to you, as the investor, in the form of higher fees. And that is WITHOUT the guarantee of actually beating the market. \n\nSecond Advantange: The majority of investors will get a HIGHER return long term with an index fund than they will by investing in individual stocks on their own. \nSeveral studies have suggested that over 92%-95% of portfolio managers could not out perform the market index over a 15-year period. And these figures are SO MUCH WORSE for the average individual investors. \n\nThird Advantage: Diversification. \nEven if you have 20 individual stocks in your portfolio, one of them dropping in price could cost you a lot of money. On the other hand, if you buy the\u00a0SP500 500\u00a0index fund, your investment will depend on 500 different stocks, only three of which account for more than 2% of the entire index. This means having a few companies go down or up won\u2019t make a huge difference in your portfolio, but you get the advantage of riding the entire market as a whole as they rise in value over time. \n\nFourth Advantage: It\u2019s easy. \nI also acknowledge that I am not a stock market expert. I cannot buy and sell stocks that will consistently beat the market long term, nor do I have an interest in spending that much time watching stock charts and reading news so I can make the proper decisions. \nSource: https:\/\/mymoneywizard.com\/3-fund-portfolio\/\n\nHow to do this:\nMy favorite index fund investing method is called THE THREE FUND PORTFOLIO:\n* US Stocks:\u00a0Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)\n* International Stocks:\u00a0Vanguard Total International Index Fund (VTIAX)\n* Bonds:\u00a0Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBTLX)\n\nThat\u2019s it. This gives you the broadest diversification at the absolute cheapest cost. Not only that, but because you\u2019re investing in multiple asset classes, you\u2019re diversified through three mostly uncorrelated markets, and that protects you against any swings from one individual market. \n\nSources:\nTIME IN THE MARKET beats TIMING the market: Charles Schwab. \nhttps:\/\/www.schwab.com\/resource-center\/insights\/content\/does-market-timing-work\n\nWarren Buffet Millionaire Bet:\nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2017\/12\/30\/warren-buffett-million-dollar-bet\/\n\nBeating the market:\nhttp:\/\/www.aei.org\/publication\/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it\/\nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/individual-investors-are-destroying-their-wealth-2012-10-19\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-08T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to become a millionaire","vanguard index funds","vanguard index funds for beginners","vanguard index fund vs etf","index fund investing","index funds vs mutual funds","index funds warren buffet","index funds explained","investing strategies","best investment strategy","how to index in the stock market","stock market investing for beginners","stock market invest strategy","three fund portfolio","investing in real estate","investing in stocks 101","how to become a millionaire in 3 years"],"title":"How To Become A Millionaire: Index Fund Investing For Beginners","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fwe-PjrX23o\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fwe-PjrX23o\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fwe-PjrX23o\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fwe-PjrX23o\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fwe-PjrX23o\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"7163","dislikeCount":"1148","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"109488","viewCount":"1440937"}},{"id":"TUQsFuofU7s","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss the holy grail of money, investing, and personal finance: How to make passive income. More specifically, some ideas that have the potential to generate $100 per day OR MORE in 2021. Enjoy! Instagram: GPStephan -- SHOW MORE \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: LIMITED $100 OFF at checkout using code 100OFF:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv\n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/activity.webull.com\/landing\/index.html?cs=a&s=GrahamS\n\nNow when it comes to making passive income, there are only two categories this falls under: \nThe first is the passive income you generate by investing your TIME\nThe second is the passive income you generate by investing your MONEY\n\nSo lets begin with the first one: Investing your time, since this is something we all have. Creating passive income like this means you invest your time upfront to create an income source that then pays you in the future, regardless on how many MORE hours you to spend on it. \n\nFirst: Affiliate marketing. This is when you promote another service or item, and you get PAID a percentage if someone buys it through you\u2026and the easiest one to set up is to join the Amazon Affiliate Program. \n\nSecond: YouTube Ad Revenue. \nFor example, I could spend 9 hours creating a video, post it, and that video continues to generate revenue for months or years to come, regardless of what else I do. The best way to do this, IN MY OPINION, Is to make how-to videos that people will search for long term. Like \u201cHow to invest in an index fund,\u201d \u201cHow to invest in the stock market,\u201d \u201chow to make money online for beginners,\u201d  etc. This is the best way to get your videos a consistent amount of views, long term, and then get a backlog of these videos that rank on the search results. \n\nThird: : Creating a how-to program. For example, I have that YouTube Creator Academy program (link above) that I created to teach people various strategies on how to grow on YouTube. Now I also spent about half a year creating my program \u201cThe Real Estate Agent Academy\u201d which teaches real estate agents how they can grow and make money in the business. \n\nFourth: Renting out an unused room on AirBnb, ARBO, HomeAway, etc. or rent out an unused storage space. \n\nNow another way to make passive income investing your TIME is by renting one of your unused rooms on AirBnb, VRBO, homeaway, or any one of these sites - or even just renting out one of your unused rooms on a short term lease. You could EVEN go even further than this and rent out your garage as a storage space! If you\u2019re living in a place right now with an unused bedroom and don\u2019t mind sharing your space with a room mate - this could be an INCREDIBLE way to start generating some passive income by using what you already have. Same if you have extra storage - someone likely would use it! \n\nINVESTING YOUR MONEY FOR PASSIVE INCOME:\n\nFirst: Investing in Dividend Stocks. \nThese are just stocks that have a payout every 3 months, and for most stocks, that payout ranges from about 1-8% annually. Your goal could be to get a mix of stock price growth - meaning it goes up in price over time and through that - you make money - while at the same time, they\u2019re giving you a dividend payout every quarter. Just make sure to hold dividend stocks in a tax advantaged account, otherwise they\u2019re taxed as ordinary income\u2026and that\u2019s bad\u2026I\u2019ll make a video on this shortly! \n\nSecond: Investing in growth stocks.  \nThese are stocks that DONT pay a dividend, but because they DONT pay a dividend to their investors, they have more cashflow to invest back into the business, and that should increase the stock price even further. If you chose just to follow the average of the market with an index fund, you should expect to see - ON AVERAGE - around a 6-8% return per year. \n\nThird: REAL ESTATE\nThe reason I like this is because there are SO MANY WAYS to make passive income with this one.\nFirst, you can go the traditional route and buy a property to then rent out. \nSecond, you can move into a multi-family property and live for free!\nThird, you can rent out your unused bedrooms!\nFourth, you\u2019re paying down the mortgage, and\nFifth, the property will hopefully go up in value long term. \n\nAnd yes, this IS something that requires upfront work and capital to set up - but if you have the 10-20% down payment to buy a property, and you have the interest and time to learn about real estate, this could be a phenomenal long term investment. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-06T23:30:00Z","tags":["passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 2019","passive income online","passive income investments","passive income apps","passive income real estate","how to make money online","how to make money on youtube","affiliate marketing","affiliate marketing for beginners","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","how to make 100 per day","how to make 100 dollars per day","how to make 100 dollars online","how to invest 1000"],"title":"Passive Income: How To Make $100 Per Day In 2021","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TUQsFuofU7s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TUQsFuofU7s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TUQsFuofU7s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TUQsFuofU7s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TUQsFuofU7s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3989","dislikeCount":"1592","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"57409","viewCount":"1161010"}},{"id":"gdQhI2ebwYA","snippet":{"description":"A survey found that 63% of millennial homeowners regret buying their home. Lets go over this study, find out exactly where people are going wrong, and make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to you. Add me on Instagram: GPStephan Merch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\n70% OFF: The Real Estate Investing Blueprint\nhttps:\/\/the-real-estate-agent-academy.teachable.com\/p\/the-real-estate-investing-blueprint\/\n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nSo lets get into these numbers: of the 63% of millennials who regretted their home purchase, these were their reasons:\n\n18% said that maintenance and repairs were more costly than they anticipated.\n12% said they bought too small of a house.\n8% said they bought in a bad location.\n7% didn\u2019t think it was a good investment.\n7% said the mortgage payment was too high.\n6% didn\u2019t get the best interest rate.\n5% bought TOO BIG of a house.\n\n\nFirst of all, 18% said maintenance and repairs were more costly than anticipated. \nThis can LARGELY be prevented by having an inspection done on the property before you purchase it, to understand EXACTLY what equipment is nearing the end of its life and might need to be replaced. This won\u2019t uncover EVERYTHING, and sometimes things just happen outside of our control, but a good home inspection and home warranty plan could eliminate a SIGNIFICANT portion of unexpected repairs in the first few years. \n\nNext, 12% bought too small of a house. \nHome ownership is NOT meant to be something you buy, live in for a year, sell, and move on - I generally encourage everyone buying a home to do so with the expectation of holding on to it for at least 5-7 years. This means if you want a family soon, and you\u2019ll need a larger home a year from now - then chances are, you\u2019re better off renting.\n\nNext, 8% bought in a bad location. \nI can\u2019t believe it. I apologize on behalf of all millennials out there. THIS IS ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE with even a mild amount of research. Spend a weekend driving around the area. Check out the neighborhood at different times of the day and night. Check crime reports and statistics. Speak to the neighbors or people walking their dogs or children. Ask them what they think of the area. \n\n7% said they didn\u2019t think it was a good investment.\nThe big flaw here is thinking that home ownership is automatically an investment when you buy something - because it isn\u2019t. It absolutely CAN be a phenomenal investment, but this rarely ever happens by chance - in order for a home to be an investment, you must treat it like you\u2019re running your own business. The value has to be there, the numbers have to make sense, and there must be upside in the deal\u2026if you see you aren\u2019t going to make money AHEAD OF TIME, don\u2019t buy it. \n\nAnother 7% said the mortgage payment was too high.\nWhen buying a house, it\u2019s a good rule of thumb NEVER to max out what you can afford. This way, in the event of a job loss or reduction in pay, you aren\u2019t locked in to a super high mortgage that was only affordable on the top range of your income. My recommendation is to buy a home that you can afford as though you\u2019re paying it off in 15 years, BUT you get the 30-year mortgage because it gives you more flexibility with payments. This way, you\u2019re not maxing yourself out and your mortgage won\u2019t be too high\u2026again, this one is easily preventable. \n\nThen, 6% said they didn\u2019t get the best interest rate.\nWhen you buy a home, you\u2019re encouraged to shop around and have lenders compete for your business. I\u2019ve gotten HUGE reductions in my interest rate by getting pre-qualified between 3 lenders, then having each of them bid-down the other until eventually I\u2019m left with the rock bottom rate. This is something that generally takes 1-4 days, and most of it is done over email - it\u2019s fairly simple. But by doing this, I\u2019m never left wondering whether or not I got the best interest rate. \n\nAnd finally, 5% bought TOO BIG of a house. \n\nSo when you put all of this in perspective, here\u2019s what I see:\nAbout 85% of these regrets could\u2019ve been avoided within one day of budgeting, planning, and investigating the property. The regrets people mention have MORE to do with the buyer\u2019s lack of planning than it does from actually owning the home. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-03-04T23:30:00Z","tags":["millenial regret home buying","real esate news","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","how to invest in real estate","how to buy real estate","how to buy a home","how to buy a home with bad credit","how to buy a home with no money down","real estate investing 2019","how to save for a home","real estate investing 101","real estate investing tips","how to invest your money","millenial home buyer","millenial home ownership","buying a home","investing in real estate"],"title":"63% of Millennials Regret Buying a Home","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gdQhI2ebwYA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gdQhI2ebwYA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gdQhI2ebwYA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gdQhI2ebwYA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gdQhI2ebwYA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2007","dislikeCount":"653","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19997","viewCount":"543939"}},{"id":"u8zc2AvYqcE","snippet":{"description":"How to save money: Here is the BEST way to save money anytime you\u2019re renting a home, and exactly what to look for to get the best deal - enjoy!

This is going to become your base search from which you\u2019re going to look at rentals.\n\nStep Two: See AS MUCH AS YOU CAN on the market. It\u2019s important to know your options, understand the going rates, and this is how you can find the best deal. \n\nStep Three: When it comes time to submit the application, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING PREPARED AHEAD OF TIME. \n\nStep Four: Negotiate the price and terms! \n\nFirst, offer 5-10% off the rent and see if they go for it.\n\nSecond, if they don\u2019t go for that, offer to move in sooner in exchange for a discount on the rent. From a landlord\u2019s perspective, every day the unit sits empty is a day of lost rent - so it helps to sometimes break it down for landlords that aren\u2019t thinking of this. \n\nThird, if a landlord is ABSOLUTELY holding out for their price, see if they\u2019re willing to give you a some free rent. This does two things: one, you end up with a slightly lower price when you average it throughout the year, and for them, they get their asking price. \n\nFourth, you can offer to pre-pay a few months ahead of time - and landlords love this. Sometimes strategies like this work well for a landlord who just wants the peace of mind that they\u2019ll get paid on time. \n\nFifth, negotiate a lower price by signing a longer term lease and locking in your rent long term. This means the landlord CANNOT raise your rent the second year, and you can negotiate these terms ahead of time\n\nStep Five: Review the lease agreement. \nGET EVERYTHING IN WRITING. In addition to that, you\u2019ll need to read through the entire lease agreement word by word to make sure there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nSTEP SIX: Before you move in, TAKE PICTURES OF EVERYTHING. \nThis is to document the condition so you aren\u2019t held responsible for any existing damage. \n\nSTEP SEVEN: Make sure you GET RENTERS INSURANCE. This is separate insurance that covers YOU and YOUR BELONGINGS in the event of damage.

NOW is your time to live frugally and invest as MUCH as you can, because RIGHT NOW, you have the power of compound interest on your side and that will grow your money to a HUGE amount by the time you\u2019re older. \n\nStep Two: WORK WITH EVERYONE\nWork with anyone that wants to do business with you. In the beginning of your career, you are NOT in a position to be picky, so don\u2019t ever think you\u2019re \u201ctoo good\u201d or \u201cabove\u201d working with someone because you won\u2019t make enough money from it. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that even the worst, most difficult, unprofitable clients I\u2019ve worked with have ended up becoming the BEST learning experiences in the long run. I may not have made money from those clients, BUT, the experience I gained from that has helped me out in so many OTHER ways that have turned out profitable. \n\nStep Three: BE SURROUNDED WITH SUCCESS\nYou know the saying, you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with\u2026come on, that\u2019s true. If you surround yourself with negative, draining people who do nothing with their life\u2026that\u2019s probably what you\u2019re going to get, too. If you surround yourself with people who are actually DOING things, and have a healthy mentality about it, then chances are, you\u2019ll get the same. \n\nStep Four: DON\u2019T LET PEOPLE DISCOURAGE YOU\nFor most people, they let others influence their decisions far too frequently, to the point where they\u2019ll never try because someone just tells them not to. So don\u2019t let someone else\u2019s insecurity or jealousy get in the way\u2026most of the time, when someone discourages you, it\u2019s them worrying that you might be successful while they\u2019re not\u2026or, it\u2019s them rationalizing why they\u2019re not successful, or how they could never take the initiative themselves.\n\nStep Five: BE OPEN TO CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM \nIt\u2019s so important just to be open to constructive, honest feedback and criticism - hear it out, and then decide from there if it\u2019s worth implementing. \n\nStep Six: TRUST YOUR INTUITION\nI think too many people ignore their intuition because they\u2019re insecure about maybe being wrong, or maybe failing. But I\u2019ve learned that if you have a gut-feeling about something, chances are, you\u2019re right - and you should follow that feeling. \n\nStep Seven: IF IT\u2019S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS \nJust go into everything with this mindset: Trust, but verify. It\u2019s okay to have a healthy amount of skepticism, BUT VERIFY everything on your own. Don\u2019t just take my word for it, don\u2019t just listen to someone and follow blindly - hear them out, but verify EVERYTHING for yourself, first. \n\nStep Eight: ALWAYS BE GROWING\nThis could be continually learning new skills, reading new books, watching youtube videos on new subjects\u2026smashing that like button if you haven\u2019t already\u2026always be doing SOMETHING to improve. I\u2019m a firm believer that if you\u2019re not getting better at something, you\u2019re getting worse. \n\nStep Nine: DO IT CONSISTENTLY \nUntil then, you really won\u2019t see much difference until your small improvements continue growing on each other\u2026just have faith in the process, and know that nothing good will happen overnight. The longer it takes you to do something, the longer it will last. \n\nStep Ten: HELP OTHERS\nSo many people are afraid of someone stealing their ideas, or being better at them at something, or taking their business. But lets be real: The world is not a zero-sum game. One persons gain is not your loss. I really believe that the more you\u2019re able to help, the more it benefits EVERYONE as a whole. \n\nShare what you know, help other people, and by doing that, it just makes your life so much better. Not only do you get to make a positive impact on someone else, but you\u2019ll never know when that person might come back and help YOU out. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-04-29T22:30:01Z","tags":["How I became a millionaire","how I became a millionaire by 26","how to become a millionaire dave ramsey","how to become a millionaire as a teenager","how to become a millionaire in 3 years","how i became a millionaire by 23","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","real estate agent","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real esate investing for beginners","how to invest in stocks","stock market investing for beginners","how to make passive income"],"title":"How I Became a Millionaire: The 10 Steps","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qg--2-HJ_f0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qg--2-HJ_f0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qg--2-HJ_f0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qg--2-HJ_f0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qg--2-HJ_f0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1864","dislikeCount":"228","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13773","viewCount":"179761"}},{"id":"zUOVMYBtvJI","snippet":{"description":"So I think it\u2019s no surprise, for those of you who\u2019ve watched my channel for awhile, or who know me in person, that I\u2019m pretty frugal\u2026here\u2019s why I don\u2019t spend money.

Because FOR ME, that $100,000 is REALLY worth $300 per month\u2026for the rest of my life. That\u2019s how much $100,000 will buy me in inflation adjusted passive income, without ever worrying about running out of principle. \n\nAnd when you see that $100,000 equals $300 per month\u2026now you can understand why I\u2019m not out there ballin with over the top luxuries. I can MAYBE increase my lifestyle $300 per month for every month I invest $100,000...but that\u2019s about it. \n\nNow call me pessimistic, or maybe I just have a realistic approach to all of this\u2026but I\u2019m not naive to think that this type of income will last forever. While I would LOVE for it to continue indefinitely, and I have NO intention of ever stopping, and I intend to be at the level of Grant Cardone, Gary Vee, and Dave Ramsey one day\u2026I just realize that things change over time, and nothing will continue on indefinitely. \n\nESPECIALLY on Social Media, I\u2019ve seen people come and go every few years\u2026it\u2019s just the normal cycle of things. And while I definitely intend to have as much longevity as I possibly can, I realize that just as quickly as my income scaled up - it could go down. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t go down though\u2026 \n\nI just really believe it\u2019s smart to PREPARE for these things because life happens, and things outside of your control can and will come up\u2026and then at the same time, focus on how you can continue growing and expanding so that it\u2019ll last as long as it possible can. Cautiously optimistic is a good way to sum this up. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing\u2026at the end of the day, money is really just about giving you OPTIONS. It\u2019s about having the OPTION to pursue what you enjoy the most. It\u2019s about having the OPTION to sleep in if you feel like it. It\u2019s about the OPTION to focus your time on what means the most FOR YOU. \n\nSo what DO I spend money on, then, if I\u2019m so frugal?\nWell, besides index funds and real estate\u2026which is basically where all my money goes..I spend it on things that really bring me value. Like I found a good deal in Las Vegas for $22 all you can eat sushi\u2026and to me, that\u2019s basically me splurging. \n\nBeyond that\u2026I really don\u2019t need to spend money to make me happy. I like sleeping in, I like doing some light gardening in the backyard when it\u2019s warm out\u2026which is like every day here in Los Angeles, I like hanging out with good friends, I love a good conversation about random stuff, I love having the creativity to make youtube videos. That\u2019s what makes me happy.\n\nAnd for everyone watching, I guess the main takeaway here is that money\u2019s main purpose is to give you security, and give you the option to pursue what you feel is best!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-04-26T21:30:02Z","tags":["Frugal","why im so cheap","why im so frugal","why i dont spend money","financial independence","financial independence retired early","minimalism","saving money","how to save money","financial independence podcast","how to make money online","how to make passive income","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","saving money tips","how to save money with low income","how to retire early","how to retire","passive income ideas","real estate 101"],"title":"Why I don't spend money.","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zUOVMYBtvJI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zUOVMYBtvJI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zUOVMYBtvJI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zUOVMYBtvJI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zUOVMYBtvJI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M9S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5864","dislikeCount":"827","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"32320","viewCount":"590621"}},{"id":"1ImuzvNzcoM","snippet":{"description":"SimpliSafe is award-winning home security that keeps your home safe around the clock.

I\u2019m a lot more conservative when than most investors, because when I buy something, I KNOW I\u2019m making money on it - I build in a large enough buffer and margin for error that even if the market goes DOWN, I\u2019m still coming out ahead. And finding these deals takes a lot of time. \n\nSecondly, if I WERE to flip a property, what a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that the profit you make is taxed as ordinary income, not long term capital gains tax. \nAnd this is where it gets rather nuanced\u2026the IRS classifies that anyone who\u2019s buying a property in an act to resell it for profit, your profit could still be counted as ordinary income. However, according to the IRS, you\u2019re now an owner-user, and you can sell that property for up to a $250,000 gain if single, and a $500,000 gain if married\u2026completely tax free. So I could \u201cflip a property\u201d\u2026by just living there for two years\u2026and then make that $100,000 profit TAX FREE just by living there instead of flipping it immediately. The more you know.\n\nIn addition to that, you also have CLOSING COSTS that will eat into your profit anytime you sell. \nI\u2019m going to pay about 6% in closing thats\u2026that\u2019s escrow, title, and insurance fees, as well as Realtor commissions. \n\nNow the THIRD reason is that, when flipping property, market timing is a HUGE factor in what you can make. \nWhen the market is consistently going up every month, it\u2019s a GREAT time to flip real estate. But given the nature of flipping real estate, how time intensive it is, and how much work goes into it\u2026most of the time, you can\u2019t afford anything to go wrong. Often, if the market goes DOWN during the time you buy it - you\u2019ll begin working JUST to break even on your investment, and sell it without losing money. \n\nOn the other hand, RENTS tend to be a LOT more stable\u2026even if the market goes down, usually rents stay about the same. This means on a rental, I can much more easily estimate what my monthly profit would be over the next few years - than I could guess what property values would be by the time I want to sell. \n\nSo with that said, the FOURTH reason I don\u2019t flip properties is because it would take my time away from my main focus, which is working as a Real Estate Agent and making these YouTube videos. \nI\u2019m the type who LOVES to avoid stress and obligation. I don\u2019t want more on my plate, I don\u2019t want more on my mind, I don\u2019t want the pressure of needing to make sure everything goes as planned\u2026I love the set-it-and-forget-it mentality, where I can pick up and go anytime I want without worrying about what contractors are doing, or concerning myself with where the next deal is coming from. That\u2019s just me, other people love the constant hustle\u2026I don\u2019t. \n\nAnd finally, I believe that when you DO buy a property like that, where you can fix it up, and it has THAT much equity in it where you can flip it for a property, chances are, you can just rent it for a higher amount than you could before. \nThis has been my mentality for every single property I\u2019ve purchased. When you run the numbers, too\u2026depending on your tax bracket..sometimes you\u2019ll actually end up with MORE money by doing a cash out refinance than you would SELLING the property and paying ordinary income taxes on it. So you\u2019ll actually make MORE NOT selling it, than you would by selling it\u2026how crazy is that. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-04-24T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate with no money","real estate investing 101","real estate investing podcast","how to make money in real estate","real estate agent","real estate investor","how to make passive income","how to wholesale real estate","wholesale real estate","how to flip real estate","flipping real estate","wholesaling for beginners"],"title":"This is why I'll NEVER flip houses...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ImuzvNzcoM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ImuzvNzcoM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ImuzvNzcoM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ImuzvNzcoM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ImuzvNzcoM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M24S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1464","dislikeCount":"239","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11527","viewCount":"285074"}},{"id":"ea7I9w_1FD8","snippet":{"description":"Here are some strategies on how to pay less in taxes, and how to understand basic tax-reduction strategies to help keep MORE money in your pocket at the end of the year.

However, the benefit to a 457 plan is that you don\u2019t need to wait until the age of 59.5 to withdraw that money\u2026you can withdraw it at ANY age, upon retirement, with zero penalty. \n\nNumber 5: The Standard deduction. \nThis is the base amount that anyone is able to automatically \u201cdeduct\u201d from their taxable income, just because. If you\u2019re single - you can take the $12,000 standard deduction. Super easy. And If you\u2019re married filing jointly, this number jumps to $24,000. This is fairly straightforward, and for most people - this is an easy one to take. \n\nSetting up an S-Corp. \nThis is a legal entity you create that you run your business through. This means that all of your self employed business income goes into the S-Corp. All of your expenses go out of the S-Corp. Distributions made by an S corporation are not subject to Social security or Medicare taxes. This is meant to be something to discuss with a CPA if this is something that you\u2019re interested in, this is way beyond what I can talk about in a YouTube video!\n\nLong term capital gains:\nIf you hold that investment for LONGER than one year - then sell it for a profit - it\u2019s taxed as long term capital gains. This means that if you make less than $434,000\u2026that long term capital gains tax is capped at 15%. \n\nDepreciating assets within your business. \nIn a business, you can depreciate certain assets over X years to offset earned income! Something like this is REALLY a topic to bring up to a qualified CPA because every business asset has its own depreciation schedule you MUST follow.\n\nHIRE A VERY GOOD CPA. THE BEST YOU CAN. \nThis videos main purpose is JUST to give you some ideas of strategies you MIGHT be able to implement. But because the tax code is sooooooo complicated and there are a million moving parts for each person that would be impossible to ever cover in a youtube video like this, YOU MUST hire a CPA. \n\nNot financial advice.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF (Limited Time Only)\n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nFirst: Be VERY careful who you listen to and who you take advice from. \nThere are a lot of people out there who are totally broke, who have no clue what they\u2019re talking about, but who LOVE to give financial advice at any chance they get. Listen to people who are where you want to be. THOSE are the people who have done what you want to do, and chances are, THAT is the advice you should follow. \n\nSecond: You GOTTA make money. I\nIf your goal is to build wealth FAST, you aren\u2019t going to get there by making money with a traditional job, unless that job is going to pay you some exorbitant amount right off the bat. Pick a career or a business that ISN\u2019T dependent on how many hours you work. \n\nThird: Don\u2019t be afraid to invest in yourself.\nIt doesn\u2019t NEED to cost you money, you can invest in yourself for free if you want to. There are SO MANY videos on YouTube for you to learn from, and you can pretty much learn whatever you want to by just googling how to do something. But I also recommend investing in yourself in the sense that you\u2019ll actually go and USE these things that you learn, and by practicing them firsthand, you\u2019ll eventually get good at them. \n\nFourth: Minimize your tax bill\n-Minimize your taxes with a 401k Contribution \n-Re-Invest back into your business so you show the IRS less NET income that you\u2019re taxed on\n-Learn how the tax code works and HIRE THE BEST CPA YOU CAN. \n-That CPA might set you up with an LLC taxed as an S-Corp, or a straight up S-Corp that becomes the entity you run your business from. \n-Consider buying items that you can depreciate, too.\nMoral of the story: The more you make, the less of your money you keep\u2026so you MUST learn how to keep your money, or at least HIRE someone who can do this for you. This is REQUIRED. LEARN TAXES.\n\nFifth: Save Money\nFirst, housing. \nThis is by far our biggest expense. Look into what\u2019s called \u201cHouse hacking.\u201d This is where you buy a 2-4 unit property, you live in one of the units, and you rent out the others. This is what I do, and it means I can pretty much live here in Los Angeles ENTIRELY for free. If buying a property isn\u2019t in the cards for you, just consider living with a room mate.\n\nSecond, your car is another big expense\u2026\nThis is where it gets a little more nuanced depending on your situation, but if you\u2019re running a business where people don\u2019t see or care what car you drive\u2026go for a 5-7 year old car that\u2019s already taken most of its depreciation, that\u2019s reliable, and that\u2019s good on gas. Learn how to car hack here:\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/gyJga_kAt_U\n\nAnother great money-saving trick I use is to NOT buy anything without first sleeping on it, or waiting a few days.\nMost of the time, those impulse purchases go away after one night\u2026and you realize you didn\u2019t really want it that badly to begin with. \n\nFinally, AUTOMATE YOUR SAVINGS. Make sure to put a set amount aside every single month no matter what happens. The funny thing is that even though it might seem like a lot of money to go without all of a sudden, you usually just find a way to make it work, anyway, until you don\u2019t even realize you\u2019ve cut back your budget. Paying yourself is a MUST, so get in the habit of always doing this. \n\nWhen it comes to this, I also recommend tracking your spending - this is fairly self explanatory, I won\u2019t go into too much detail on this, but use a site like Mint.com or Personal Capital that\u2019ll track everything you spend, so you can see where you\u2019re blowing money on random stuff.\n\nAND FINALLY\u2026JUST INVEST YOUR MONEY in something OTHER than your business, in something that you intend to keep a very long time that will constantly pay you. When it comes to me, I like index funds and real estate - that\u2019s pretty much all I do. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-04-19T22:30:02Z","tags":["how to build wealth","how to build wealth with no money","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth with low income","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to build wealth in real estate","how to build wealth from nothing","how to invest","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","rich vs poor","rich people habits","how to make money online","investing for beginners","real estate 101"],"title":"How To Build Wealth With No Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HE0oEOdeb8g\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HE0oEOdeb8g\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HE0oEOdeb8g\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HE0oEOdeb8g\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HE0oEOdeb8g\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M6S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2828","dislikeCount":"727","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"53850","viewCount":"776559"}},{"id":"xNl8jOilTZY","snippet":{"description":"Forget 1% cash back\u2026these are the HIGHEST Cash Back Credit Cards right offered now that will give you the MOST money back, all the way up 5% - enjoy!

And this video will tell you EXACTLY how to do that with real world examples that actually work. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nGET $50 OFF FOR A LIMITED TIME WITH COUPON CODE: THANKYOU50 \nThe Real Estate Agent Academy:  Learn how to start and grow your career as a Real Estate Agent to a Six-Figure Income, how to best build your network of clients, expand into luxury markets, and the exact steps I\u2019ve used to grow my business from $0 to over $125 million in sales: https:\/\/goo.gl\/UFpi4c  \n\nJoin the private Real Estate Facebook Group:\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/therealestatemillionairemastermind\/\n\nNow first, when it comes to this, I think it\u2019s important we address a comment I\u2019ve received far too often that REALLY needs to be talked about, and that\u2019s the concept of \u201cpaying down your mortgage early with a HELOC.\u201d \n\nSo first, what\u2019s a HELOC: This stands for Home Equity Line Of Credit. \nThis is pretty much like using your home as a bank account, where you can borrow money against the value of your home. And you only need to pay back what you end up actually using. \n\nFirst of all, a HELOC is generally at a HIGHER interest rate than you pay with a traditional mortgage.\n\nSecondly, HELOC\u2019s are generally what\u2019s called \u201cVariable Interest Rate Loans\u201d - which means the interest rate you pay will fluctuate over time, meaning it could be HIGHER in the future. Compare this to a fixed rate mortgage, which will not fluctuate whatsoever - what you pay is what you pay for the lifetime of the loan, until it\u2019s paid off.\n\nThird, with a HELOC - there are also transactional costs, including appraisal fees, transaction fees, processing fees, smashing the like button if you haven\u2019t done that already fees, title costs, the list goes on. This all needs to be factored in the overall cost of applying for this line of credit, OR whether or not this money might be better spent somewhere else - like just paying down your existing mortgage a little more. \n\nAnd Fourth - one of the main reasons I\u2019d absolutely never do this - is that the interest you pay on a home equity line of credit is often NOT a tax deduction if you use that to pay off existing debt. \n\nOn the other hand, if you ACTUALLY want to pay down your mortgage faster - and save money - here are the REAL ways to do it:\n\nThe first is what\u2019s called a refinance. \nThis is when you go to a bank and they will give you a brand new loan that replaces your previous loan. This works best when interest rates go down, and all of a sudden you can pay a lower interest rate if you get a new loan. \n\nSo if you\u2019re out there and you realize that you can save money on your mortgage by refinancing to a lower interest rate, do it. ALWAYS DO IT.\n\nThe second method to pay down a mortgage early is to make bi-weekly payments.\nThe way your mortgage is calculated is by your total outstanding loan balance. So instead of making one payment per month, you can make half of that payment every other week\u2026and as we all know\u2026or I guess as we all SHOULD know\u2026. there are 52 weeks in the year, so you\u2019ll make 26 bi-weekly mortgage payments. And if we just math a little more, 26 half payments equal 13 full payments per year instead of 12 per year if you had paid monthly - and that cuts down your loan time substantially. \n\nThe third way to pay down a mortgage earlier is by making extra payments towards your loan. \nConsider that with a mortgage payment, you\u2019re making 12 payments throughout the year, every single month. But if you ever get an end of year bonus, or any lump-sum check or tax return - and you throw it all into the mortgage - that could cut down your mortgage time by a LOT. Just making 2 extra mortgage payments per year could lower your mortgage time by 7 years. \n\nAnd the best way to pay off your mortgage your mortgage earlier\u2026is just to pay your mortgage off earlier. \nThere\u2019s no other way around it - I recommend always refinancing if you can get a lower interest rate to save money, you can make bi-weekly payments to speed up the process even further, but beyond that, you gotta pay it off using your own money by just paying it down sooner. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-04-15T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to pay off your mortgage early","pay off mortgage in 5 years","pay off mortgage early","pay off mortgage early dave ramsey","pay off mortgage","pay off mortgage with heloc","heloc to pay mortgage","pay off mortgage or invest","pay off mortgage in 5 to 7 years","pay off mortgage fast","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing strategies","real estate for beginners","investing for beginners"],"title":"Real Estate Tricks: How To Pay Off Your Home Mortgage FAST","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lGb7R6E1sKA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lGb7R6E1sKA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lGb7R6E1sKA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lGb7R6E1sKA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lGb7R6E1sKA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M37S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2667","dislikeCount":"793","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"22254","viewCount":"383562"}},{"id":"u0HbZoXC47c","snippet":{"description":"Uber is getting ready for an IPO.

Any amount of speculation is for entertainment purposes ONLY, and this is not to be considered financial advice. I have no monetary gain from the performance of Uber stock.\n\nUber is one of the largest, if not THE largest ride-sharing company in the world with 91 MILLION monthly users. They also expect to IPO and become a publicly traded company with nearly a $100 BILLION dollar valuation. \n\nHowever\u2026when you go into the financials, that\u2019s where things start getting a little shaky\u2026because they LOST $1.8 Billion dollars in 2018. In addition to that, they\u2019ve handled ongoing lawsuits\u2026.fighting regulation every step of the way\u2026AND they warn that they may NEVER achieve profitability\u2026so from my perspective, I\u2019m not seeing how this IPO would make a good investment. \n\nJust look at the past performance of some previous IPO\u2019s\u2026the average return for IPO\u2019s from 2012-2015 was just 7%. Meanwhile, the SP500 was 60%. Think about that for a second\u2026the overall stock market performed nearly 10x BETTER than tech IPO\u2019s during that timeframe\u2026and lets be real, picking a winning IPO is going to be like picking a needle in a haystack.\nhttps:\/\/cbi-blog.s3.amazonaws.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/vc-backed-ipo-performance-tech.png\n\n\nSo if you\u2019re interested in investing in Uber, here is my take on it:\nFirst of all, NEVER buy on hype. Hype just means the price is artificially inflated through investor exuberance and enthusiasm, and this doesn\u2019t reflect the TRUE value of a company. \n\nNow If you believe OBJECTIVELY that this is a good LONG TERM BUSINESS, and you believe they\u2019re an undervalued company with more room to expand - than by all means, invest in it. But understand that MOST investors are emotional, looking for quick profit, and that will effect the price of the stock that YOU pay, especially around the time of IPO.\n\nHowever, just to be fair\u2026on the GOOD side of things, I do believe Uber can learn from Lyft\u2019s mistake, and I do think that them filing for an IPO afterwards wasn\u2019t by random chance. I think they\u2019re large enough where everything they do is VERY strategic, and them waiting to IPO could give them some advantage over Lyft.

Instagram: GPStephan \nTesla Referral: Get 1000 Miles Free Supercharging: https:\/\/ts.la\/stephan88194\n\nMy Dad's Comic: https:\/\/squareup.com\/store\/Bliss-On-Tap-Publishing\/item\/train-the-zombie-express\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF (Limited Time Only)\n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nI\u2019d say the biggest complaint in that video was that people felt my title was \u201cClickbait\u201d for two reasons:\n\nOne, I only talked about the first year of ownership on the car - not what happens after that.\n\nSecond, what I do is NOT applicable to everyone, which is where I think much of the confusion came from.\n\nFirst:\nWhen it comes to business write offs, this doesn\u2019t mean that my literal payment is $78.39 per month - quite the opposite. I am still paying $640 per month to own the car, but I SAVE money at the time I file my tax return - which brings down the NET ownership cost at the end of the year. \n\nYes, second year I continue to pay $640 per month - my monthly payment does NOT change at all. \n\nHowever - here\u2019s what happens. \nI can continue to depreciate the value of the car over the following 4 years. Since I depreciated the car the first year already, I have 4 MORE years left that I can continue to depreciate the value. The current tax basis of the car is $40,000 minus $8200 first year depreciation, which leaves us with $31,800 remaining. We\u2019ll just keep things simple, divide that over the remaining 4 years - and this means I can continue to enjoy an AVERAGE of $7950 per year as a write off over the following 4 years. \n\nDuring the second year, I\u2019m continuing to pay interest on the loan balance - which is $1165. \n\nI\u2019ve still paid $640 per month on the car\u2026which works out to be $7,680 after the first year. \n\nThen I write off $7,950 in depreciation and $1165 in loan interest, which comes out to be an $8845 write off. \n\nIn my tax bracket, that saves me about $3095 in taxes\u2026which is subtracted by by my the total car payment  that year\u2026and that brings down my monthly NET out of pocket \u201ccost\u201d to $382 per month for the Tesla. \n\nHowever, what many people forget is that from my $640 per month payment, only $100 per month is that is interest - the rest pays down my loan, and that\u2019s \u201cequity\u201d I have in the car. So I\u2019m paying an out of pocket expense of $382 after taxes, to get BACK about $520 per month in terms of net asset value. \n\nThis calculation continues until the last year of payment, when almost all of that monthly payment is principle, and the car is paid off in full. So after the second year, my \u201cnet\u201d to me is essentially nothing. I\u2019m also NOT including the cost of gas savings, since the cost of running this car on electricity is 1\/4th the cost of Gas here in California. \n\nNow HERE is are nuanced details when doing this:\nFirst, this is NOT sponsored by Tesla. I wish they would sponsor me, but I love talking about money and finance, and even though it\u2019s a nuanced topic that\u2019s highly specific to the person, I like getting people to think about these things. \n\nSecond, When I SELL the car, I WILL have to pay what\u2019s called depreciation recapture - since I depreciated the cars value, if I sell it above the current tax basis, I have to pay taxes on that higher amount as though it\u2019s ordinary earned income. \n\nI also chose to get a LOAN on the car instead of buying it in cash because I knew the interest would be a write off, and I can make MORE than 3.75% if I invest in real estate or in index funds - so this meant the less money I have tied up in the car, the better. I\u2019m not getting a loan because I CAN\u2019T afford it - I\u2019m not getting a loan because it\u2019s just the SMART thing to do financially. \n\nAnd finally, for everyone talking about added insurance costs - the  insurance cost isn\u2019t that bad - insurance companies base their values on the MSRP of the car when new. For a Model S at a $100k sticker price, even if you buy it USED, it\u2019ll be about as expensive to insure as any other $100k car. My model 3 was $40,000 brand new, and cost just as much to insure as my previous $40,000 Mercedes C - Class. And for anyone curious, I\u2019m paying $215 per month for full coverage on the Model 3 and a Lotus Exige S240. \n\nSo I hope that clears up any confusion for anyone wondering. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-04-10T22:30:00Z","tags":["tesla","tesla model 3","tesla model 3 review","tesla model 3 auto pilot","tesla model 3 performance","tesla model 3 summon","tesla rebates","tesla tax write offs","tesla review","how to buy a tesla","how to finance a tesla","tax write offs","tax deductions","tax write offs explained","how i bought a tesla for 78","how to make money","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income investing","how to invest","how to invest for beginners","investing for beginners"],"title":"The truth about my $78 per month Tesla","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IU89AryuY3A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IU89AryuY3A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IU89AryuY3A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IU89AryuY3A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IU89AryuY3A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M7S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3148","dislikeCount":"650","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10864","viewCount":"329679"}},{"id":"L6KlAaVmaAE","snippet":{"description":"Tour a custom-built $44,000,000 Mansion in the Hollywood Hills, featured on Selling Sunset, and toured with Jason Oppenheim of The Oppenheim Group.

This means if you pay more than $3750 in federal taxes, you will receive this entire amount back at the time you file your tax return. That money is as good as cash.\n\nCalifornia drivers are also eligible for a $2500 Electric Vehicle Rebate, in which the state will mail you a check for $2500 upon showing proof of purchase. \n\nNow Tesla gets a little sneaky after this\u2026because in that $29,450 figure, Tesla also \n\n\nSo excluding the gas savings and only focusing on the first two, cash-value rebates, the ACTUAL price of the car comes to $33,750. For a brand new Tesla. Standard Range Plus. With AutoPilot. \n\nSo here\u2019s how I bought this car for $78.39 per month:\n\nBecause I financed 100% of the car, my ONLY out of pocket cost was the taxes, license, and registration - which came to $4437.01\n\nFrom the remaining amount I financed, my payment comes to $640 per month, or $7680 in the first year. \n\nThat means, in the first year, my total out of pocket cost is $12,117.01 between my payments, taxes, insurance, etc. \n\nHowever, after the rebates and tax credits, that brings my TOTAL cost of owning this car for the first year down to $5867.01. \n\nBecause this car is for business use, the $1438 I pay in interest on the auto loan is a tax write off, the $4437 in taxes, licensing, and registration I paid upfront is a write off, and I can depreciate the car against my income. That\u2019s a $14,075 tax write off\u2026which saves me roughly about $4,926.25 in taxes. \n\nSo remember\u2026my total out of pocket cost was $5867.01 after electric vehicle tax incentives. PLUS I save $4926.25 in taxes\u2026that means I\u2019m effectively buying a BRAND new Tesla Model 3 for $78.39 per month out of pocket\u2026and realistically, this works out to be a FREE car when you take into account that MOST of that $640 per month loan payment goes towards principle, and that I can invest my money in real estate at a significantly higher return than what I\u2019m paying in interest on the Tesla. But in terms of out of pocket cost: $78.39 per month. \n\nAnd after going through the experience buying a Tesla like this, completely sight unseen, without ever having driven one before, I have to say\u2026I don\u2019t understand the concern of Tesla\u2019s no-dealership model. Personally, I think the entire worry is overblown - and I think we\u2019ll start to see a lot MORE car companies embracing this online-only business model. \n\nWe\u2019re naturally entering an era where everything is done online. I haven\u2019t been to a mall or physical store in FOREVER because it\u2019s more convenient to buy it online, and USUALLY for a more competitive price because online stores have lower overhead, and that savings is passed down to the customer. \n\nAnd for that, I have to give Tesla credit for being the first to really challenge the traditional business model of selling cars. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-04-03T22:30:02Z","tags":["tesla model 3","tesla model 3 review","tesla model 3 autopilot","tesla model 3 performance","tesla model 3 electric car","tesla model s","new vs used car","buy vs lease car","buy or lease a car","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","tesla stock","model 3 review","model 3 vs model s","how i bought a tesla","78 dollar tesla","financing a car","how to buy a car","how to invest in real estate for beginners","stock market investing for beginners","passive income"],"title":"How I bought a Tesla for $78 Per Month","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kWvs5H32Oyc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kWvs5H32Oyc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kWvs5H32Oyc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kWvs5H32Oyc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kWvs5H32Oyc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"20873","dislikeCount":"49380","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"146673","viewCount":"7281062"}},{"id":"90bwcP9EaNI","snippet":{"description":"I got sued by Apple for my Credit Card video, please share this video to spread the word.

I do not ever flip real estate, I never wholesale real estate, I never invest for the short term. So given that my intention is SPECIFICALLY as a buy and hold investor, what I do is known as the BRRRR method:\nBuy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat.\n\nBuy:\nI buy properties in high demand, up-and-coming areas. I also always look at properties JUST below the average price for the area\n\nMy specialty, if I have a specialty, is 2-4 unit buildings. Those are my favorite. WITHIN those 2-4 units, I always try to find a building where each unit is around 2-3 bedrooms, and 2 bathrooms. This is the sweet spot for rentals. \n\nI also try to find places that need MINOR cosmetic renovation. This means that the structure and internals of the house are fine\u2026but it just looks old and dated. To me, this really gives you the best bang for the buck in terms of ROI and adding value to the property. \n\nWhat makes my strategy a little more unique is that I move in to one of the units, then rent out the others. \nThe other rented units should cover all of your expenses, and then you live there FOR FREE. The reason I do this is because it allows me to buy a 2-4 unit property under owner-occupied financing, meaning I get a lower interest rate, less money down, and much better loan terms on the building. \n\nSo anyway, lets then talk briefly about the next part of my strategy: Buying under market value. \nThere\u2019s a saying in real estate that goes something like this: you make your money when you buy, not when you sell. This is EXTREMELY TRUE. Buying something under market value like this really just takes patience\u2026good deals don\u2019t come up every day, you\u2019re going to miss out on so many of them until you finally get the right one. \n\nIn terms of renovating\u2026I leave it all up to a contractor. \nI don\u2019t ever touch a hammer, or attempt to do any of the work myself. I just don\u2019t know how to do any of that. So instead, I\u2019ll find a contractor through either word of mouth, or finding someone highly rated on YELP. \n\nAnd NOW\u2026You rent it out! \nLike I mentioned, the rents should ideally cover all of your expenses.\nHow to rent a property: https:\/\/youtu.be\/hS8lIrzEwv0\/\nHow to calculate cashflow: https:\/\/youtu.be\/DgWcrsavcJs\/ \n\nNow, after about 6-12 months or so - depending on your bank - you can do what\u2019s called a refinance. \nGiven that you bought the property under market value, and you hopefully fixed it up to increase the value even further, you\u2019re hopefully sitting on a good amount of equity in the property. If the numbers make sense, and interest rates are low enough like they are right now, you can do what\u2019s called a \u201ccash out refinance\u201d on a property.\n\nAnd then, obviously, the last step is just - REPEAT THIS PROCESS AGAIN. \nIf the market goes up as you\u2019re doing this, amazing - that means your properties are going up in value, too. \nIf the market goes DOWN as you\u2019re doing this, amazing - now you get to buy cheaper properties in the future. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-31T22:30:02Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","how to make passive income","passive income strategies","passive income ideas","how to retire early","how to invest","investing for beginners","brrrr method","how to invest in real estate","how to invest money","how to invest for beginners","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","how to make money"],"title":"Buying A $0 House: My Real Estate Investing Strategy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YrOcHJYYl-0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YrOcHJYYl-0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YrOcHJYYl-0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YrOcHJYYl-0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YrOcHJYYl-0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2106","dislikeCount":"123","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16051","viewCount":"138610"}},{"id":"CRVYXC2OH7U","snippet":{"description":"We need to have a talk today about something concerning I\u2019ve noticed in the investment community: IPO\u2019s.

Sometimes money is used for research and development, sometimes it\u2019s used to expand into other territories, or to potentially acquire other, smaller companies and add to its world dominating control. \n\nSee, usually, when a company is still REALLY small, it\u2019ll first be funded either out of pocket - or more commonly, through angel investors. These are investors who put in their own money to help a company get off the ground, and in exchange for that, they get equity ownership in the business. \n\nThen as the business starts getting some traction, it\u2019ll need MORE money\u2026sometimes hundreds of millions of dollars. Usually this is where PRIVATE MONEY INSTITUTIONS begin pouring in, because rarely can one single person just throw in $100m on something that may or may not make any money back. \n\nBut after awhile, as the company gets bigger and stronger, this type of venture capital gets harder and harder to get. So when private capital just becomes harder to raise, sometimes an IPO is the only next logical step. This means the business can sell ownership in their company PUBLICLY, so that ANYONE can go and buy a $50 share of Smash The Like Button Incorporated, and the company can raise as much money as it needs.\n\nSo why does a company IPO?\nFirst, it\u2019s common that a company in its growing stage will postpone making a profit for the sake of growth. They\u2019ll often operate at a loss JUST to gain market traction, and then decide to profit later. \n\nBut\u2026we now have the SECOND, NOT SO OBVIOUS reason companies need more money\u2026\nIN MY OPINION\u2026sometimes the company will need money as a way to cash out while they still can, or just to keep the gravy train running. Or, a company might simply just be running out of money - unable to make profit - and they need more money to continue the ride until they can find a plan to one day make profit. \n\nWhy is an this a bad thing? Well, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s all inherently bad, and I think there can be a lot of amazing advantages to doing an IPO\u2026but what I DO see as a concern, is the recent valuations of BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES that are unprofitable, and may never make a profit\u2026but they go public, people buy them up, and then they drop in value as the hype wears down. \n\nNow, here\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at: this is just a rant I needed to say, because I enjoy talking about this, but most importantly, it\u2019s just to serve as a reminder that media attention, hype, and frenzy does not equate to a profitable investment. All of these things are temporary, and once the hysteria begins settling down, you\u2019re left with the actual question: is this a company that\u2019s worth what I\u2019m paying for it, and will they EVER make money? And also think\u2026is actually a GOOD deal for me to buy it based on the fundamentals of other, similar companies? If the answer is no\u2026then don\u2019t do it. If you can\u2019t afford to lose money, don\u2019t do it. End rant. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-29T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","investing for beginners","investing in the stock market","stock market investing","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in stocks for beginners","investing strategies","how to buy stocks","how to invest in stocks with no money","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","passive income for beginners","investing in IPO","how to make money online","passive income strategies","investing 101"],"title":"The Reason I Don't Buy IPO Stocks","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CRVYXC2OH7U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CRVYXC2OH7U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CRVYXC2OH7U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CRVYXC2OH7U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CRVYXC2OH7U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M29S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1456","dislikeCount":"91","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6659","viewCount":"89702"}},{"id":"NlAC-MIoOLA","snippet":{"description":"Lets address a comment I\u2019ve been getting a LOT lately: When the real estate market drops, you\u2019re going to lose everything. Here\u2019s what will happen - enjoy.

IT HAS TO. The way the system is designed, we will naturally go through phases of high demand, where prices go up - people capitalize on that momentum - demand soon tapers off - people over leverage themselves and have to sell - and too much selling drops the market even further. Then, that inventory is slowly bought up at low prices - demand begins to come back, and prices begin to increase again. \n\nWhat\u2019s realistic to expect? \nArguably, 2008 was the worst drop in real estate prices since 1929\u2026and real estate, on average during that time, dropped 30% in value. Some areas were obviously hit much less, and some areas much more\u2026but lets take the average 30%, and say that\u2019s how much the market is going to drop. So what\u2019s going to happen, and what would happen to me?\n\nWell\u2026the boring answer is, relatively nothing happens. This mainly has to do with the style of investing that I practice and talk about on this channel, known as the BRRRR method. This is all it is:\nSave up about 20-25% as a down payment\nBuy a property under market value (this is like getting it at a discount)\nRenovate it - which further increases the market value \nRent it out - the rent will cover all expenses + profit\nRefinance and get your money back - if applicable \nRepeat as necessary\n\nThis relies strictly on cashflow, forced appreciation, and patience - and that\u2019s what so many people fail to realize. The market value of the property is an arbitrary number that makes no difference to me after I buy it, for any other reason OTHER than to refinance and get my money out, if it makes sense at the time. If it doesn\u2019t make sense, or values aren\u2019t up to expectations, I don\u2019t refinance - and I keep my loan balance the same.\n\nSo given that, what would happen in a hypothetical scenario, if 2008 happens again, and real estate prices dropped 30%?\nEven a 50% drop in prices would still leave me equity in the deal without being underwater. I bought those properties with the intention of never selling.  Instead, I ONLY care about one thing: CASH FLOW. My intention all along was to buy a property, rent it out, and in 30 years from now - the mortgages will be paid off in full, and I\u2019ll just retire off a surplus of rental income.\n\nAs you can see, this chart shows a 30% decline in prices from 2008 to 2012. \nCompare that to this chart showing the rental prices during the same time period. Rental prices were nearly unchanged the entire time, and began going up as home prices were falling. \nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CSUSHPINSA\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CUSR0000SAS2RS\n\nRental properties are almost immune to outside market factors for one simple reason: we all need a place to live. \nhttps:\/\/www.curbed.com\/2019\/1\/10\/18139601\/recession-impact-housing-market-interest-rates\n\nHowever, we DO NOT have the same driving forces TODAY that caused the drop in 2008. Banks are NOT giving out subprime mortgages, they are NOT giving out 0% down loans, they are not allowing risky borrowers to buy homes, they are not\u2026NOT smashing the like button\u2026and all of which SPECIFICALLY caused real estate to get hit very, very hard. \n\nThis is the reason I\u2019ve chosen the method of buy-and-hold rental properties, because data and my own personal experience has shown that they weather recessions very well, they\u2019re stable, they\u2019re consistent, you can build up positive equity very quickly, and as long as you have the income to pay for the loan during a vacancy or repair, your chances of success are MUCH HIGHER than if you are just out there buying whatever and trying to sell it. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-27T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in real estate with no money","real estate investing 101","how to make passive income","passive income","passive income for beginners","passive income 101","passive income ideas","real estate agent","real estate investing strategies","how to invest money","best investments","how to make money online","how to buy a rental property","investing 101"],"title":"Am I about to lose everything?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NlAC-MIoOLA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NlAC-MIoOLA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NlAC-MIoOLA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NlAC-MIoOLA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NlAC-MIoOLA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6139","dislikeCount":"561","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"21625","viewCount":"310931"}},{"id":"-BkdYpzNeg0","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s how to travel the world for free, in just the time it takes to watch this video - by using the power of credit cards. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nThis is the secret to traveling the world for free: CREDIT CARD CHURNING\nCredit cards will offer incredible bonuses JUST for signing up for their credit card. People who understand the art of how the system works, can use this to their advantage by signing up for said credit card, meeting the minimum requirements to get the bonus...then GET the bonus, redeem that for all types of free travel, and then move on to the next card and repeat the process again. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve been traveling anywhere I\u2019ve wanted to go, entirely for free. \n\nNow when it comes to doing this, there are some VERY important rules that must always be followed in order to practice this successfully, this is what they are: \n\nFirst, NEVER spend ANY money you wouldn\u2019t ordinarily spend. \nThe correct thinking is: I\u2019m going to put my normal, every day spending on this credit card until I reach the requirement\u2026then I\u2019m going to get the bonus, for money I was going to be spending, anyway. \n\nSecond, never pay any credit card interest.\nFor almost EVERY credit card out there worth getting, you are ONLY charged interest if you don\u2019t pay off your balance off IN FULL by the time it\u2019s due. So ALL you need to do is NOT spend money you don\u2019t already have, and then pay off your credit card in full\u2026then you pay ZERO interest. \n\nThird, DO NOT DO THIS if you\u2019re about to get a loan on a house, or a car. \nThis is because there IS a very mild impact on your credit score each time you apply for a credit card. Expect that opening up a credit card might lower your score anywhere from 3-10 points temporarily. This is no big deal for someone dropping from a 730 to a 724, or for someone who isn\u2019t planning to get a mortgage or a car loan in the next 8-12 months - it isn\u2019t going to make any difference to you. \n\nFourth, canceling the card:\nAnd my answer is always this: it really depends on the card. If the card does NOT have an annual fee, I will ALWAYS keep it - no matter what. There\u2019s zero downside to keeping it open, so you may as well just enjoy it as an extra credit card, even if you rarely ever use it. And on the cards that DO have fees - it really just depends if I get value from the card or not. If you\u2019re not going to get the value for the card after the first year, and it has an annual fee, close it. If you will get value from the card and find it worth it, then keep it open. \n\nBecause these offers change frequently, if you\u2019re watching this video after June 2019\u2026I would recommend checking out the following sources which list the BEST offers each month, and keep a current up-to-date list:\nhttps:\/\/thepointsguy.com\/\nhttps:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/churning\/\n\nIn addition to that, you have two Youtube channels I watch all the time:\nAsk Sebby: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC2cC48A261pBVKztLyzOAnA\nThe Credit Shifu: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCEVXhsR6e3D522BHQj9MlLg\n\nThe American Express Gold Card 40k or 50k Point Offer:\nhttps:\/\/monkeymiles.boardingarea.com\/new-american-express-gold-card-50k-referral-offer\/\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Preferred credit card:\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/2wco8pA\n\nThe Chase Ink Preferred Business (THIS ONE IS MY REFERRAL LINK):\nhttps:\/\/www.referyourchasecard.com\/21\/ZVSGGIXM8U\nIf you don\u2019t want to use my link, here\u2019s the chase link directly:\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/2VD9BOe\n\nThe AMEX Hilton Honors:\nhttps:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/american-express-hilton-ascend-125000-point-no-lifetime-language-offer\/\n\nSo as you can see\u2026these free rewards REALLY start adding up quick. Start small, get one credit card bonus at a time - slowly scale up as you get more comfortable with it, and pretty soon you\u2019ll be traveling around the world, getting free hotels, and smashing that like button in every country! \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-24T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to travel the world for free","how to travel for free","how to travel for cheap","how to travel for free with credit cards","credit cards","credit cards 101","credit card churning","credit card points","how to increase your credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","how to improve your credit score fast","how to improve your credit","credit score 101","credit card guide","credit card explained","how to fix your credit score","passive income","how to get paid to travel"],"title":"How To Travel The World For Free: Credit Cards 101","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-BkdYpzNeg0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-BkdYpzNeg0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-BkdYpzNeg0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-BkdYpzNeg0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-BkdYpzNeg0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M16S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3625","dislikeCount":"490","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"38337","viewCount":"431699"}},{"id":"1UEKwbIO34Q","snippet":{"description":"I felt like this is something worth addressing, given just how much mis-information there\u2019s been surrounding a few of the recent videos I\u2019ve made.

Instead, they just focus on one, single word: DEBT. \n\nTo be honest, this isn\u2019t surprising to me, because we live in a culture which both glorifies and vilifies the act of borrowing money\u2026On the one hand, if there\u2019s something you want\u2026doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t afford it\u2026you can finance it. But with that, comes some very scary consequences\u2026\n\nConsumer debt reached an all time high, of $4 Trillion Dollars\nFrom that, $1 Trillion Dollars is charged to a credit card\u2026\nAnd to top it all off, nearly 70% of college students graduate with nearly $30,000 in student loans\n\nSo how do we solve this, and what\u2019s the solution? Well, most people believe it\u2019s by practicing one basic rule when it comes to managing money:\nDEBT IS BAD. AVOID IT, ALWAYS. \n\nSee, when I think of debt, I see a game of life that you choose to play\u2026and you have the option, right now, to pick which team you want to join. \nOne team plays defense.\nThe other team plays offense. \n\nThe people who believe that \u201cDEBT IS BAD\u201d will pick defense. \nThey avoid it at all costs, any amount of debt needs to be paid off immediately, and they want to preserve as much of what they already have as possible. Instead of playing to win, they play NOT to lose. And while that is a very SAFE strategy\u2026without any offense, they won\u2019t score. \n\nOn the other side though, we have OFFENSE. \nThey embrace debt, they don\u2019t concern themselves with paying it off early, and they just want to score - even if that means risking the game in order to do that. These are the people who PLAY TO WIN\u2026.and while this is a RISKY strategy that could pay off, without a good defense, they could just as easily lose. \n\nHowever, ANY well-calibrated team is NEVER one, or the other\u2026it\u2019s NEVER an ultimatum, and no one team JUST plays offense, or JUST plays defense\u2026instead, the best teams in the world find the ideal strategy of combIning BOTH into a winning formula. Same applies with DEBT.\n\nTo me, this is what that winning combination is:\n\nIf the DEBT cannot make you money, AVOID IT - ALWAYS. \nIf buying something WILL NOT make you more money - then ONLY BUY IT if you can afford to pay for it outright. \n\nOn the other hand, \nIf DEBT WILL make you more money, EMBRACE IT. SOMETIMES. \nIf buying something WILL make you more money - it\u2019s OK to finance it - SOMETIMES. \n\nThat\u2019s the differentiation between good, and bad debt: \nI do not take out loans on real estate speculation, I do not spend the loaned money on anything that doesn\u2019t make me more money. I do not take loans that a bank can randomly \u201cCall\u201d if the value declines. I do not take on loans that I couldn\u2019t already afford to pay if the properties are vacant. And I do all of this within my means. \n\nIf you have the education, the self control, and the persistence to make smart, calculated risks - using debt can be like playing an intense game of offense. But if you abuse it, waste it, and get caught in the cycle of random consumer spending of random crap - you WILL get burned. Don\u2019t be reckless, don\u2019t get greedy, and don\u2019t over-leverage\u2026play it safe, take it slow, continue learning, and pretty soon you\u2019ll be $1 million dollars richer, and smashing the like button with leverage.. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-22T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 101","how to make passive income","passive income strategies","passive income ideas","how to make passive income online","real estate tips","real estate investing podcast","passive income","debt snowball","how to pay off debt","how to get out of debt","how to pay off your mortgage early"],"title":"The Reason I\u2019m $1.8 Million In Debt","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1UEKwbIO34Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1UEKwbIO34Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1UEKwbIO34Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1UEKwbIO34Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1UEKwbIO34Q\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5408","dislikeCount":"972","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"34469","viewCount":"602581"}},{"id":"smvvTw5GhyM","snippet":{"description":"I\u2019m proud to say that this property\u2026was free.

I liked this area in particular because it was close to nearby transit, surrounded by several large new developments, it was only a 15 minute drive away from the beach\u2026and most importantly, it was one of the few areas in Los Angeles where property prices were still selling under $1 million dollars. \n\nAfter 6 months of searching, writing offers, getting out bid, and otherwise not finding a single opportunity - the perfect spot came up. And the price? Listed for\u2026$585,000. \n\nSo I made them an immediate offer: I\u2019ll pay full price, guaranteed to close\u2026under the condition, that the owner accepts it immediately.\n\nI bought it for $585,000\u2026I put $150,000 as a down payment, and I got a loan for $438,000 to cover the rest.  \n\nThen, I spent another 2 months, and roughly $80,000 fixing it up. This meant, when I was finished, I had invested a total of 2 months worth of time, and $230,000 into a property. \n\nSo I went to the bank, and I told them I wanted to do what\u2019s called a REFINANCE. This is when the bank will give you a new loan on the property, based on the CURRENT value of what it\u2019s worth - NOT what you paid for it. \n\nAnd the market value was very favorable to me\u2026an appraiser determined the market value of my property, for a remodeled 1920\u2019s Spanish duplex, was now $780,000, just shortly after I bought it. \n\nSo given the new value, the bank is able to give me a mortgage of up to $585,000, and give me back $145,000 in cash. \n\nMy current mortgage is $438,000\nThe bank\u2019s NEW loan is $585,000\nThe new loan pays off the old one, and that leaves us with $145,000 left over after paying some transaction fees. \n\nThat was in 2017. NOW\u2026I can do it again. I went from bank, to bank, to bank\u2026to get a quote on a new mortgage. I was able to get at 3.75% fixed rate mortgage for 30 years, on a cash out refinance. The bank appraised it for $965,000. And given the new $965,000 value, I was allowed a $675,000 mortgage - leaving 30% worth of equity still in the property. \n\nThat meant\u2026after all was said and done\u2026not only do I have $290,000 worth of equity in the property\u2026but I now SAVE an extra $200 per month on my mortgage interest payments, and I got back ALL of the $230,000 I invested, leaving a total out of pocket cost, to buy this property, of $0\n\nLike I said, the first refinance got me back $145,000\u2026and the second got me back $85,000. That was everything I had invested in this property\u2026and it\u2019s basically free real estate. \n\nIn real estate, your ideal situation is that you can control 100% of an income-generating asset\u2026by having as LITTLE of your own money invested in it, as well. This gives you the opportunity to INVEST your money in other, higher generating opportunities - than keeping your money tied up in an asset where it isn\u2019t actively working for you. \n\nThis is the name of the game in real estate\u2026it\u2019s to find a good deal, put your money in, make it work for you, refinance your money back out, keep the property\u2026then go and use that money to do it again. And it\u2019s by doing that, over and over and over again, that you can soon build up an empire of real estate, for free, by just\u2026smashing the like button. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-20T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing 101","real estate passive income","how to make passive income","passive income strategies","passive income for beginners","passive income ideas","passive income 101","how to invest","investing for beginners","how to invest for beginners","investing strategies","how to make money online","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"How I Bought This House For $0","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/smvvTw5GhyM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/smvvTw5GhyM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/smvvTw5GhyM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/smvvTw5GhyM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/smvvTw5GhyM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M18S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"11070","dislikeCount":"9679","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"137280","viewCount":"2299752"}},{"id":"hCC7tUYlxT0","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s EXACTLY how much I made from 10 million views on YouTube, and I\u2019ll go in detail about how YouTubers make money and how the income is generated.

Seeing that was just motivation for me, and I\u2019d think \u201chey, you know what, stuff like this is possible if you give out good, honest content that\u2019s hopefully entertaining\u2026you\u2019re consistent with it\u2026you really care about what you produce\u2026you treat people with respect\u2026this is something to one day aspire towards.\u201d\n\nSo that\u2019s just my intention with this video, and now I get a chance to throw my hat in the ring as someone who would watch those video. So I mean all of this as a way of inspiration, because that\u2019s how it was for me, or just to satisfy anyone\u2019s curiosity as to how much a youtube channel can make. \n\nNow the thing I\u2019ve noticed that happens is that when ONE video gets a LOT of views, THE OTHER videos tend to get more views, too. And it makes sense, if someone watches one video and enjoys it, chances are, they\u2019re going to watch OTHER videos of yours, too. You also have \u201cRecommended\u201d videos come up on the side or below the video, as well\u2026so if you have a one million view video, chances are, 10-20% of those people go on to watch OTHER videos - and you\u2019ll see a trickle of views throughout everything. So even though most of my views and income came from just a few videos, the overflow into other videos increases the revenue even further.\n\nTWO THINGS I WANT TO SAY WITH THIS:\n\nIn terms of how much I make, I realize this is SIGNIFICANTLY more than other YouTube channels make\u2026by a LOT. I need to say this because inevitably, there\u2019s someone in the comments that says I\u2019m lying because \u201cSocialBlade says I make less.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: In terms of calculating how much a YouTube channel makes, it\u2019s really important to understand that ad rates differ from channel to channel and there are SO MANY FACTORS to take into consideration. This might include the type of channel, the topic of the video, how long that video is, the watch time of that video, how many ads are in that video, and what advertisers are wiling to bid for that video. \n\nSecond, the way my channel typically works is that probably 80% of my views are from NON SUBSCRIBERS\u2026meaning that YouTube pushes my video out to a mass audience and says \u201cHey\u2026we think you need to see this, watch this.\u201d And if you ignore it, Youtube is like \u201cno\u2026.really\u2026you NEED to see this.\u201d And it keeps showing up until you finally give in and watch it. And then once you do watch it, Youtube is like \u201cHey\u2026we saw you watched the video\u2026here\u2019s a DOZEN others EXACTLY like it.\u201d That\u2019s the circle of life here on YouTube. \n\nSo I was EXTREMELY fortunate this month that this didn\u2019t happen just once\u2026it happened FOUR TIMES. ALL WITHIN THE SAME 2 WEEKS. The Tesla video, the $250,000,000 man video, and my two Apple Credit Card Videos made up about 60% of my views. That was just a LUCKY blessing from the almighty YouTube algorithm.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed that generally videos like this get pushed a LOT during the first week or two, and after that, it drops down to almost nothing. So these videos aren\u2019t making me anything like they were a few weeks ago when they were getting pushed.\n\nAnd again, I just want to thank you for your support and for watching the channel. I REALLY do my best to make these videos as tastefully as I can, because all of this is meant to show everyone what you can do, to encourage more people on youtube to make educational content\u2026and just save money. And for all of you watching to this point, you\u2019re the best\u2026like, everyone in the comments just feels like family to me at this point. When you start to talk to people week after week, month after month, for over two years\u2026like, I feel like I know so many of you even though we\u2019ve never met. So thank you,, I hope I been able to help or add value to all of you just as much as you\u2019ve helped me, and we can continue just making the world a better place.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-17T22:30:01Z","tags":["passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","passive income online","how to make passive income","how to make money online","how to make passive income online","how to make money on youtube","how much does youtube pay","how much do youtubers make","how much do youtubers earn","how much i made from 10 million views","10 million view viral video","how to get paid on youtube","how do youtubers make money","ways to make money online","passive income investments"],"title":"How much I made from 10 Million Views in 30 Days","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hCC7tUYlxT0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hCC7tUYlxT0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hCC7tUYlxT0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hCC7tUYlxT0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hCC7tUYlxT0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"9121","dislikeCount":"1610","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"123313","viewCount":"1304513"}},{"id":"xkaDAUAXuDk","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered why rich people are cheap? Well, it turns out there might actually be evidence to prove why - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nTo understand this, we have to dig deeper into the psychology of becoming wealthy, and get to the source of where it all begins. One of the more pertinent revelations was that 86% of Millionaires were self made. And even more remarkable was that 78% of them started out as middle class or poor. \n\nFrom that, we can dispel the notion that rich people mostly come from wealthy families and inherit their money. In fact, the vast majority of them built up their wealth the old fashioned way: through hard work, diligent saving, and long term investing. \n\nBusiness Insider found that it took the average self-made millionaire 32 years to reach a one million dollar net worth. Even more astonishing, fewer than 1% of millionaires were able to do that before the age of 40. \n\nThe first, logical conclusion from this research is that: rich people didn\u2019t get rich by wasting money. \nWhat many people fail to realize is that the personality trait of someone who diligently saves and invests their money to one day become a millionaire, doesn\u2019t magically change the day they become wealthy. \n\nSecondly, speaking of keeping their money\u2026to most millionaires, every little bit counts. \n\nThis becomes very evident when you start breaking down the statistics. A survey conducted by Millionaire Corner found that 1 out of 3 people with a net worth above $5 million dollars\u2026shop at, you wanna take a guess? The answer is: Walmart. That\u2019s right. 1 \/3 people worth over $5 million shop at Walmart. And we can go even further. 50% of those high net worth individuals shop at Costco, and 25% of them shop at Target. \n\nThird, studies have shown that a person\u2019s spending habits are largely dependent on how quickly and easily they make their money.\nAnd, no surprise\u2026the faster you make money, the quicker you tend to spend it.  The National Endowment for Financial Education found that up to 70% of people who receive a large amount of money upfront, blow it within a few years. \n\nPsychologically, earning a LOT of money, very suddenly, has a large impact on how much that person is likely to spend, and when a person\u2019s wealth isn\u2019t derived from their own financial habits and discipline over long periods of time, they\u2019re less likely to keep it. People who receive large windfalls also have a harder time conceptualizing just how much they really have or how long it will actually last them, because they\u2019ve had no prior experience dealing with wealth. \n\nNow fourth, when it comes to that, the majority of millionaires understand that their wealth isn\u2019t permanent, so they\u2019re more likely to save. \nAccording to the 2015 Survey of Affluence and Wealth, which analyzes data from the top 10% of earners worldwide, found that 81% of respondents were concerned about unquantified risk. This led to an over-abundance of savings, knowing that wealth can very easily be short lived.  The reality is that wealth can be very much fleeting, and most self-made millionaires recognize this - and plan for a time when they WON\u2019T be making the money they are right now. \n\nAnd the fifth thing to remember, is the millionaires often recognize the long term value of money. \nSaving $20 per week on groceries by going to Walmart might not seem like a lot of money when someone\u2019s worth $5 million dollars. However, what many people fail to realize is just how much $20 per week adds up when saved and invested. \n\nAnd sixth, saving money becomes a habit that\u2019s hard to break. \n\nLike the studies discussed earlier, the majority of rich people became rich through decades of living frugally and investing. Longtime habits like this are not easily broken, especially when they\u2019ve become engrained time and time again for, on average, the 32 years it takes for someone to become a millionaire. \n\nSo, given all of this information, it\u2019s easy to see how the idea developed over time that \u201crich people are cheap.\u201d \nAnd as of now, there\u2019s been enough research and data to suggest that, overall - this is relatively true, that rich people DO INDEED place a higher emphasis on saving money. It\u2019s because of that they\u2019re often rich to begin with.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-15T22:30:00Z","tags":["investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing in stocks for beginners","investing in real estate","investing 101","how to make money","how to make money online","passive income","passive income ideas","financial independence","financial independence retire early","how to save money","best ways to save money","why are rich people cheap","why rich people are so cheap","rich people are cheap","best ways to invest","how to invest 1000","how to invest 10000","real estate investing"],"title":"Why Rich People Are Cheap","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xkaDAUAXuDk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xkaDAUAXuDk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xkaDAUAXuDk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xkaDAUAXuDk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xkaDAUAXuDk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4315","dislikeCount":"458","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"44149","viewCount":"524749"}},{"id":"95W29GEc6Bo","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about Bitcoin and what I THINK caused the recent jump in price - enjoy!

When this happens, many investors decide to shift their money around to different asset classes\u2026typically, we\u2019ll see that in bonds, gold, and Bitcoin. \n\nThe second theory, is that it\u2019s slowly gaining more mainstream acceptance.\nOne of the unforeseen benefits of bitcoin DROPPING was that, for the first time in awhile, its price wasn\u2019t fluctuating 10-20% in a day and it could ACTUALLY be used for what it was created for: a currency. You\u2019re noticing many more \u201cmainstream\u201d businesses begin to actually USE bitcoin\u2026this includes Starbucks, Nordstrom, Whole Foods, and Home Depot. While it\u2019s rumored that this is just an experiment for now, it\u2019s evident that more and more people have begun to take it lot seriously. \nhttp:\/\/fortune.com\/2019\/05\/13\/bitcoin-comes-to-whole-foods-major-retailers-in-coup-for-digital-currency\/\n\nThe third theory\u2026and perhaps a more controversial one\u2026for entertainment purposes only\u2026is that the price is currently being altered, yet again. \nThis is too long to type out, refer to 5:55 of the video for an in-depth look into my thoughts. \n\nThe fourth theory: FOMO\nIt\u2019s people recognizing that the price is going up, and they don\u2019t want to miss their chance at getting rich. So they buy in and the price goes up a little more. Then, as the price goes up, MORE people jump in because they don\u2019t want to be left out, too - and then the price goes up even more. And then it happens again, and again, and again\u2026and given the history of Bitcoin, this could - potentially - go up for quite a long time, until it doesn\u2019t. And when it comes to investing, that is NEVER the habit of a profitable, long term investor. EVER.\n\nDo NOT invest in something just because you have the urgency to not want to miss out, or to think \u201cthis is your chance to get rich.\u201d \n\nAnd in terms of where I see this going in the future, I\u2019ll just end it with this\u2026no one knows. If you\u2019re OK putting your money in Bitcoin, and you accept the risk that you could very well lose a significant portion of your money, then by all means, go for it. \n\nAgain, that\u2019s not to say that one day Bitcoin won\u2019t be worth a ton of money - or it might be adopted on a large scale - and if you really, truly believe in it, by all means. But don\u2019t jump in because of FOMO, do your research, and don\u2019t EVER invest money you can\u2019t afford to lose. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-14T20:00:02Z","tags":["Investing","Bitcoin","bitcoin explained","bitcoin news","how to invest","investing strategies","investing strategies for beginners","how to invest online","investing online","how to make money online","should you buy bitcoin","bitcoin price","investing in your 20s","how to get rich","passive income"],"title":"WARNING: The Truth About Bitcoin","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/95W29GEc6Bo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/95W29GEc6Bo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/95W29GEc6Bo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/95W29GEc6Bo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/95W29GEc6Bo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4707","dislikeCount":"1049","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13935","viewCount":"315075"}},{"id":"JC1W26IWB3A","snippet":{"description":"These are my recommendations and strategies that I\u2019ve figured out along the way, that you can utilize to really make the most out of your 20\u2019s, financially.

The best way to make a ton of money and become wealthy, is by starting a business, and have that business be mobile. Most of the time, a business will make you WAY more money than your investments will EVER make. \n\nSo when you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s, PLAY TO WIN and make as much money as you can. Then, WITH THAT MONEY, invest \u201cNOT TO LOSE\u201d so you actually keep it. That way, you\u2019ll always have your foundation working for you, no matter what\u2026so remember, be aggressive with business, be safe with investments. \n\nThird: TAKE RISKS. \nYou have a VERY unique time right now where, if you try something and fail, you have plenty of time to recover. If you lose money, it\u2019s no big deal. If something doesn\u2019t work out, oh well, it\u2019s not the end of the world. \n\nThis also applies to INVESTING in your 20\u2019s, as well\u2026you can make much riskier investments, because you have a much longer timeframe to recover from any losses.\n\nFourth: Reconsider College.\nHonestly, for most people who really want to become WEALTHY early in life - college does very little for you. In fact, most of the time it\u2019ll set you back between the cost of college, and the opportunity cost of wasting 4 years in a classroom where you could be out there actually doing something. \n\nFifth: AVOID LIFESTYLE INFLATION. \nIf you make more money, keep your expenses the same - don\u2019t change a thing - and invest the difference.\n\nSixth: Stay away from bad debt. \nIf your DEBT isn\u2019t MAKING you money, AVOID IT. Plain and simple. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-13T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in real estate","how to invest 1000 dollars","how to invest money","how to invest in your 20s real estate","how to be wealthy","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","how to start a business","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","stock market investing"],"title":"How To Invest In Your 20\u2019s to be Wealthy In Your 30\u2019s","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JC1W26IWB3A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JC1W26IWB3A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JC1W26IWB3A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JC1W26IWB3A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JC1W26IWB3A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M58S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6974","dislikeCount":"911","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"84881","viewCount":"1321831"}},{"id":"dSTR_CJQGJk","snippet":{"description":"If you want to make more money right now, here are 5 real world, practical ways to make that happen - which, most importantly, actually work and pretty much anyone can do them.

Job hoppers are believed to have a higher learning curve, be higher performers, and even to be more loyal. They\u2019re seen as taking charge of their own careers, they keep their skills sharpened, they can adapt to a variety of tasks, they know how to get a job if they need one, and those are ALL qualities any employer would want to have. \nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cameronkeng\/2014\/06\/22\/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less\/#6b8e42c1e07f\n\nNow, the THIRD way to make more money pretty quickly, without a significant amount of effort, is to take advantage of promotional offers. \nCredit Card Churning: \nThis is the practice of opening up new credit cards for the signup bonus, meeting the minimum spending requirements for money you ordinarily would spend, and then getting all the free stuff. \nResource: https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/the-best-credit-cards\n\nSECOND, you can also do this with BANK ACCOUNTS. \nBasically, banks will give you a bonus just for opening an account with them - usually this ranges from $150-$500 or so, depending on the offer and the bank. \nResource: https:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/best-bank-account-bonuses\/\n\nTHIRD: WeBull Free Stock Option: https:\/\/activity.webull.com\/landing\/index.html?cs=a&s=GrahamS\nWeBull will give you a totally free stock just for signing up using the link, and then you\u2019ll get a second free stock when you deposit $100. Each stock will be worth anywhere from $3-$300.\n\nRobinHood Free Stock: https:\/\/share.robinhood.com\/ardalas\nRobinhood is another free stock trading platform that\u2019ll give you a stock worth $3 to $150 when you sign up.\n\nFOURTH way to make extra money: Check for Unclaimed Funds. \nCheck Unclaimed.org or MissingMoney.com and search your name in the data base to see what comes up. This is a REALLY easy way to get money you would otherwise have just forgotten about. \n\nThe Fifth way to make extra money is by negotiating your expenses and saving the difference. \nI\u2019m just a firm believer that a penny saved, is actually more like 1.5 pennies earned depending on your tax rate. So the ROI for saving is worth a LOT higher than the ROI of earning EXTRA money. So I recommend you go through all of your expenses, and see what you don\u2019t need and can either cancel altogether, or negotiate for a lower price. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-10T22:30:02Z","tags":["how to make more money","how to make money online","how to make money as a teenager","how to make money fast","how to save money","how to save money with a low income","how to save money fast","how to invest","investing for beginners","investing in stocks for beginners","investing in real estate","investing 101","how to make passive income","how to ask for a raise","how to negotiate","passive income","passive income strategies","passive income ideas","passive income online"],"title":"5 Ways To Make More Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dSTR_CJQGJk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dSTR_CJQGJk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dSTR_CJQGJk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dSTR_CJQGJk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dSTR_CJQGJk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M15S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1558","dislikeCount":"208","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"8168","viewCount":"130965"}},{"id":"aYTqF756OYQ","snippet":{"description":"Meet Matt McKeever, the Real Estate Investor who now owns 16 buildings, 58 units, with 102 Tenants.

All of them were purchased so I could fix them up and then rent them out. And until 8 months ago, I did ALL the managerial work myself. But last year when I had a vacancy from a tenant who was relocating for work, I just didn\u2019t have the time to show the property to anyone else. I was so busy working as a real estate agent and trying to pump out 3x youtube videos per week that I didn\u2019t have the time to answer every phone call that came in, I didn\u2019t have the time to manage the work needed to fix it up, and I knew that I pretty much had no other choice other than to hire a property manager to handle it all for me.\n\nIn the beginning, I definitely had some issues: \n\nMy first complaint was that I disliked the pictures they used. \n\nMy second complaint was that they added a 20% surcharge to all the renovation work the property needed, which on a $3000 renovation, was an extra $600. \n\nMy third complaint was that they aren\u2019t as careful about picking tenants as I am, just because it isn\u2019t their place.\n\nNow all of that was over 8 months ago, so here\u2019s what\u2019s happened since then:\n\nFirst of all, I rented the property out for 15% MORE than my last tenant was paying\u2026that was a combination of the rental market just going up in value, and that I always rent my properties under market value just to rent it out quickly and attract a good tenant.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s been REALLY, REALLY nice just to have the peace of mind not to THINK about this property at all. P\n\nThird, it\u2019s nice that they keep track of ALL income and expenses for me, I don\u2019t do a single thing except give their end of the year statement to my CPA who handles everything else on my tax return. \n\nFourth, I have to admit, I like the distance between myself and the tenant. And big lesson for all the real estate investors out there: the more friendly you are, the more you get taken advantage of. Tenants can, and will, push limits and the more you budge, the more they get away with. \n\nFifth, my overall experience is that - after 8 months - hiring a property manager was ABSOLUTELY worth it, and I should have done it much sooner. I\u2019m slowly going to be incorporating them into the others, and hopefully one day I\u2019ll be fully removed from the day-to-day aspects of managing rentals.\n\nAnd for anyone watching who\u2019s thinking about investing in real estate, or if you have rental property already\u2026my advice is to first do it yourself, learn how the business works, learn how to manage tenants\u2026and once you get to the point where your time is better spent elsewhere, THEN get a property manager. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-06T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate investing tips","real estate investing strategies","real estate 101","property management","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income strategies","how to make money online","passive income online","real estate agent tips"],"title":"What happened with my Property Manager\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xv8CGchPoHw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xv8CGchPoHw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xv8CGchPoHw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xv8CGchPoHw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xv8CGchPoHw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1184","dislikeCount":"125","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7948","viewCount":"113567"}},{"id":"8Z2DOF_C_Ak","snippet":{"description":"Even though most of us know how to properly use credit cards by now, these are Top 5 most common credit card \u201cmyths\u201d I\u2019ve heard and whether or not there\u2019s any truth to them - enjoy!

And paying more interest on a credit card DOES NOT increase your score any further than if you paid it off entirely, in full. \n\nInstead, here\u2019s what REALLY helps your credit score\u2026and it\u2019s important to understand this, because I\u2019ll be referring to this later in the video:\n\n35% of your credit score consists of your PAYMENT HISTORY: This means you pay your credit by the time it\u2019s due, without any late payments. And when it comes to this, paying off your bill IN FULL or just making the minimum payment and leaving a balance will affect your score THE EXACT SAME in this category, as long as you just pay on time. \n\n30% of your score is calculated by your credit utilization: this is amount you have available to use, versus how much you actually use.\n\n15% of your score is calculated by the length of your credit history\u2026the longer you have credit, the more robust your score will be.\n\n10% of your credit score is calculated by \u201cnew credit\u201d - generally the newer your credit lines, the lower your score will be, and this has a small impact. \n\n10% of your score is calculated by the number and mix of credit lines of you have\u2026it helps to have multiple credit cards, an auto loan, lease payments, mortgage payments, or a variety of different \u201ctypes\u201d of credit showing you\u2019re responsible at paying all of those off on time. \n\nSECOND MYTH: Too much credit makes it harder to get a house or car loan\n\nBack in the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, the conventional thought among mortgage lenders was that if a borrower had access to too much available credit, they posed a higher risk of default because they\u2019d have the ability and temptation to use all of it. However, in the late 1980\u2019s, the FICO scoring method began analyzing their credit files\u2026and that revealed that borrowers were NOT more likely to default on their payment if they had more credit available to them. And the \u201ctemptation\u201d of having more credit would not \u201ccorrupt\u201d an otherwise responsible borrower who paid on time. In fact, they found that the more available credit borrowers had, the safer they were, and the higher the credit score they should have!\n\nTHIRD MYTH: You should cancel cards you no longer use\nUnfortunately, doing this could end up dramatically lowering your credit score and in most circumstances, this is a REALLY bad idea that you should avoid. If you have an old credit card you don\u2019t use, just keep it that way\u2026make sure to still keep it open, put it in a drawer, forget about it, put it in the frozen in a block of ice, give it to me so I can buy stuff with it\u2026I really don\u2019t care what you do. As long as you don\u2019t close it.\n\nFOURTH MYTH: Opening up a credit card will lower your score. \nThe answer to this is one\u2026is YES. Opening up a credit card WILL have a negative impact on your score\u2026but this isn\u2019t as bad as people generally make it out to be. From my experience, overall, opening up a new credit card has such a minimal effect on your credit score\u2026and in some cases, I\u2019ve opened up new credit cards and seen my score actually INCREASE. So when it comes to this, I don\u2019t really worry about it. If it does impact your score, it\u2019s minimal\u2026and long term, there are usually more benefits adding different lines of credit to your account. \n\nFIFTH MYTH: You should use old credit cards to prevent them from being cancelled\nAnd this myth is true. Credit Card companies only have the ability to extend a limited amount of credit to people, and they only make money when people use those cards\u2026so when they extend credit out to someone who just NEVER uses their account, they\u2019ll often cancel those cards so they can extend that credit line to someone else who will actually use it and make them money. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB","publishedAt":"2019-05-03T22:30:02Z","tags":["credit cards","credit cards for beginners","credit cards explained","credit card information","how to increase your credit score","how to increase your credit score fast","how to increase your credit card limit","credit card mistakes","how to increase your credit score 100 pts","how to build your credit score","credit score techniques","perfect credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","credit score to buy a house","passive income","how to make money online"],"title":"What Credit Card Companies Don\u2019t Tell You","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Z2DOF_C_Ak\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Z2DOF_C_Ak\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Z2DOF_C_Ak\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Z2DOF_C_Ak\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Z2DOF_C_Ak\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M22S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1571","dislikeCount":"238","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"15080","viewCount":"285871"}},{"id":"t-5veYUeatw","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about how to retire early by investing in real estate, and this will will cover it all: real estate, passive income, financial independence, retiring early\u2026and smashing the like button.

Then come up with an average number that you NEED to replace in income every month. Here\u2019s your challenge: For the next 4 months, TRACK EVERYTHING you spend money on. Your goal AT FIRST should be to earn enough rental income JUST to cover your NECESSARY expenses. \n\nNext, save up a down payment of about 10-20% of the properties purchase price. \nAnd in terms of saving this amount of money, you NEED to make it a priority. If that means you cut back on vacations, take up a part time job, or scale back on your expenses just to save a little more - do it.\n\nNow once you\u2019ve got that down payment saved, the second step is to buy a 2-4 unit building that you can move into yourself. \nHere\u2019s why this step is so important:\nWhen you buy a property as a PRIMARY RESIDENCE - meaning you\u2019re going to move in and personally live there - you can qualify for what\u2019s called conventional owner occupant financing. This means you\u2019ll get a lower interest rate and you\u2019ll qualify for a lower down payment, compared to buying an INVESTMENT property. The ONLY requirement when doing this is that you MUST live in the property for 12-24 months. After that, you can do whatever you want with the property - and meanwhile, you\u2019ve locked in a low interest rate and a low down payment. \n\nThird, IDEALLY you should fix up the property.\nAny time you\u2019re looking to not only increase the properties value, but also increase the cashflow\u2026fixing it up is the way to go. My favorite places to buy are just the ones that look a little out dated. For someone just starting out, I don\u2019t recommend you take on too big of a project. This should be something that would take any handyman or contractor under one month to do, from start to finish. \n\nSo now, what do you do once you\u2019re done fixing it up? RENT OUT THE OTHER UNITS! \nThis is where the cost of the other units should ideally cover ALL of your property expenses\u2026this includes your mortgage, property taxes, insurance, repairs, maintenance, and anything else that comes up. \n\nYou\u2019re now going to do what\u2019s called a CASH OUT REFINANCE. \nThis means your bank will give you a NEW loan, based on the new, HIGHER value of your property after you fixed it up\u2026and you profit the difference in CASH. \n\nThis means you now can use that money to find ANOTHER place to buy because you have your money back! \nThe GENIUS with this concept is that if you just keep taking this extra rental income, and re-investing BACK into more real estate, you can start to see these numbers grow VERY, very quickly. Because now, in addition to re-using your own equity to buy more properties, you\u2019ll have extra rental income every month to invest in EVEN MORE REAL ESTATE. This is just compound interest working on a very extreme level. \n\nThe ONLY requirement on your end, is to save up the initial down payment and renovation budget\u2026NEVER spent the rental income while you\u2019re re-investing it back into your portfolio, and put in the work to do this consistently until you\u2019ve made enough rental income to cover your expenses. \n\nSo as you can see, this is such a great method for retiring early\u2026as long as you decide to dedicate ONE DECADE of your life to doing this part time, you can be set for EVERYTHING after that, just by this!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-05-01T22:30:00Z","tags":["How to Retire Early from Real Estate Investing","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","how to retire early","how to make passive income","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income for beginners","passive income 101","financial independence","real estate investing with no money","passive income online","retire early tips","brrrr method","how to flip real estate","how to buy real estate","how to save money"],"title":"How to Retire Early from Real Estate Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/t-5veYUeatw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/t-5veYUeatw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/t-5veYUeatw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/t-5veYUeatw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/t-5veYUeatw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M38S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2917","dislikeCount":"452","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"39625","viewCount":"691785"}},{"id":"AGauMQ8_LrA","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss the recent interest rate changes from Ally Bank, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, and Wealthfront - Enjoy!

The bank will then make a profit on the spread between the loan that they give someone else, and what they pay YOU as interest. \n\nAnd when it comes to how much banks can reasonably charge someone for a loan, for the most part, they\u2019re based on the 5 and 10 year treasury yield, which is largely driven by market expectation of supply and demand. Since the yield has been dropping, savings accounts begin to pay out less.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s really important to understand that the interest rate you get from a Savings Account WILL fluctuate over time\nNone of these rates are set in stone, and a bank can raise or lower rates at any point in time, at their discretion. If the FED decides to RAISE interest rates, you will get paid more from your savings account\u2026and if the market expects a rate CUT, then you will get paid LESS from a savings account. \n\nThird\u2026this is NOT that big of a deal, and I\u2019m really surprised how upset people are getting over this.\nWith Ally Bank and Macrus by Goldman Sachs, we\u2019re talking about a .1% interest rate cut\u2026that means for every $10,000 you have, you are getting paid 83 CENTS LESS PER MONTH. And after taxes, that\u2019s like a difference of 60 CENTS per month, for every $10,000 you have deposited. That\u2019s NOT that big of a deal. \n\nBut when it comes to this, I do absolutely need to mention the elephant in the room\u2026Wealthfront. \nThey just took an entirely opposite approach from EVERY other bank out there, by RAISING their cash account interest rate from 2.51% - 2.57%, just moments after Ally Bank announced they were lowering theirs. \n\nNow all of this is PURELY just my opinion\u2026not financial advice\u2026BUT, I think Wealthfront did this on purpose because they saw a weakness in their competitors, and determined THIS was the moment that they could make some BIG power moves to gain marketshare\u2026and I have to say, it worked. \n\nMy biggest concern, however, is whether or not the 2.57% interest rate is sustainable\u2026I have a feeling this might be a teaser rate to gain some traction, and once they feel like they\u2019ve got a large enough foothold on the market, they\u2019ll lower them back down. \n\nBut honestly, only time will tell\u2026and for a no frills, pure cash account JUST to keep your money in\u2026Wealthfront seems pretty decent, and SO FAR I\u2019ve been happy with them. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-28T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to invest","investing","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing 101","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","passive income for beginners","wealthfront","robinhood","ally bank","marcus goldman sachs","best savings account","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate 101","investing money","investing apps","investing in your 20s"],"title":"Why I\u2019m leaving Ally Bank","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AGauMQ8_LrA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AGauMQ8_LrA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AGauMQ8_LrA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AGauMQ8_LrA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AGauMQ8_LrA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2470","dislikeCount":"378","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13627","viewCount":"380522"}},{"id":"xk9D4UPybMI","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss how to make passive income with $0 - and the truth about using your time to generate money online.

Find out what your value proposition is, and make that VERY well known - because you won\u2019t get something for nothing. \n\nThe first, obviously, is by starting this youtube channel.\nYou don\u2019t need to be some creative genius to make youtube videos. And don\u2019t give me the excuse that you don\u2019t have a personality for youtube\u2026I didn\u2019t think I did, either. Plus my early videos were AWFUL\u2026if you have fun doing it, by all means, go for it. Just make the types of videos you, yourself, would want to watch.\n\nSecondly, in a addition to that, speaking of informational products, I later created two programs - one, how to grow your business as a real estate agent. And the second, how to grow a business on youtube. \nThe concept is pretty simple: why teach one person, at one time? It\u2019s incredibly inefficient\u2026when instead, I can record the information ONCE in a condensed form, and reach thousands of people in the same amount of time it takes to teach one? Informational courses do INSANELY well, and there\u2019s a reason why everyone is doing them right now. They cost nothing to make, there\u2019s no overhead, they can reach anyone on the planet, and as long as you put the customer first, give more information than they pay for, and are all around helpful - you can do decently well, and I\u2019m sure some courses out there will have a fairly long lifespan is you make them as thorough as possible. \n\nThird, some of you have probably noticed my amazon affiliate store where I link to the items I use for recording. \nAmazon affiliates is absolutely the easiest thing for a beginner to implement, because it\u2019s simple to sign up for, it\u2019s easy to drive traffic to amazon, and you get paid anytime someone buys ANYTHING through your link. \n\nThe fourth way you could make passive income with $0 is through social media - like Facebook or Instagram.\nIf you have a hobby, or involved in something - I guarantee there are at least 10,000-,100,000 people out there who feel the same way. Use facebook and instagram to your advantage to grow a completely organic following around that - no paid promotion, no spending money on anything, do it all organically. That audience will be valuable in the event you decide to monetize in the future. \n\nFifth is running an AirBnb business\nThis is when you go to a property that\u2019s on the market for rent, approach the owner, and explain that you\u2019ll manage the airbnb for him for a percentage of the profits. That way, the home owner could make MORE money than if they rented the house out on a long term lease - the owner has no management at all - AND you can make a profit for doing the work and setting it up. \n\nBesides that, you have the typical mentions of blogging\u2026everyone says that, so I don\u2019t want to be super cliche\u2026or running affiliate marketing and driving traffic to someone else and getting paid for it\u2026all of those are viable ways to make money, IF you\u2019re willing to put in the time to learn and get good at it. This could be as simple as hosting a very inexpensive website, ranking topics on google, and organically growing it over time. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-26T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to make passive income","how to make passive income online","passive income","passive income strategies","how to make money","how to make money online","social media marketing","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","stock market investing","how to make passive income with 0","how to make money fast","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire"],"title":"How To Make Passive Income With $0","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xk9D4UPybMI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xk9D4UPybMI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xk9D4UPybMI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xk9D4UPybMI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xk9D4UPybMI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M40S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1742","dislikeCount":"416","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"17178","viewCount":"266467"}},{"id":"7ZedbecroYA","snippet":{"description":"Nearly 60% of adults do not have enough money saved to cover a $1000 emergency\u2026so here are 5 simple tips on how to save more money, even with a low income.

Just kidding\u2026obviously. But my first \u201cTrick\u201d that I use is that if there\u2019s anything I\u2019m looking to buy\u2026don\u2019t \u201cBUY IT NOW\u201d..instead, I always just \u201cbuy it tomorrow\u201d\nThis one is really just about cutting down on impulse purchases that you make without really thinking about it\u2026because this one gets really interesting once you start digging deeper. Many studies have shown that shopping can release dopamine in the brain, which then brings about a sensation of well-being and happiness. And if we take a step further, research has shown that the dopamine hit doesn\u2019t actually come from the purchase itself\u2026it comes from the ANTICIPATION of the purchase. \n\nFrom this, we can conclude that BUYING something won\u2019t necessarily give you that fun excitement you\u2019re looking for\u2026and you can get all the same enjoyment from shopping\u2026by not actually buying anything, and instead, window shopping and then saving the money.\nhttps:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/brain-wise\/201510\/shopping-dopamine-and-anticipation\n\nSecond, assuming you\u2019ve waited a day and you\u2019re thinking about buying something - think to yourself: \u201cif someone offered me the cash value for this item - would I take it?\u201d\nSometimes we forget about how much something is going to cost us when we\u2019re so fixated on just getting the thing that we want. But start thinking to yourself: if I had the choice between buying this item, or getting paid that exact amount of money - which would I rather have? Because, in essence\u2026when you decide not to buy something and save the difference - it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re getting paid to save. \n\nThe third trick to saving more money is to think to yourself \u201chow many hours will this cost me to pay for it?\u201d\nBasically, we have a limited amount of time on this planet - and it\u2019s important we make the best use of our time, not only from a financial standpoint, but also from personal fulfillment. Given that, it\u2019s vital that we spend our money on things that are most important to us - and since our time is a very limited resource, we shouldn\u2019t spend our time working for things that don\u2019t bring us long term value. \n\nNow fourth, a fun exercise you can do is whenever you save money by not buying something, or by spending less - is by immediately transferring the difference into another account. \nThis is a great way to not only make sure you actually keep the money you\u2019re saving, but it\u2019s also really effective because you can begin seeing the immediate results of cutting back. I think that once you begin seeing it work firsthand, you\u2019ll be more likely to get excited at the aspect of having some extra cash laying around - and you\u2019ll be more likely to stick with it. \n\nAnd fifth\u2026most importantly, think of what your money is worth in its future value. \nWhen you save and invest your money, it\u2019s going to grow over time\u2026when you spend it, it\u2019s almost like your halting its growth that it would have been worth, had you saved it, instead. So, instead of spending $20 on avocado toast, you took that $20 and invested it over the next 40 years\u2026if you just took the average, historic return of the stock market - adjusted for inflation, with dividends reinvested\u2026that\u2019s a lot to say\u2026that $20 would be worth about $300 in future value. \n\nAnd lastly, if you\u2019re already doing all of the above, and you\u2019re still not saving enough\u2026you need to make more money.  EVERYONE will get to a point, eventually, where they cannot possibly save anymore\u2026and it\u2019s at that point where you should begin to shift your efforts from saving, to learning how to increase your income. \n\nThis could be learning a new skill, picking up a side job, looking to switch careers, smashing the like button, you name it - the point is, increasing your income is the necessary last step when it comes to saving money. \n\nAnd I really believe that it\u2019s by implementing these strategies, slowly over time, and sticking with it, that you have the potential to begin saving a LOT more money - without really feeling it, until you look at your bank account and see all those extra Benjamins. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-24T22:30:01Z","tags":["how to save money","how to save money fast","how to save money with low income","how to save money as a teenager","how to save money for a car","how to save money for a house","how to save money for college","how to make money","how to make moeny fast","how to make passive income","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","money saving tips","money saving tricks","how to save 10000 fast"],"title":"5 Tricks That Save A LOT of Money FAST","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7ZedbecroYA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7ZedbecroYA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7ZedbecroYA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7ZedbecroYA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7ZedbecroYA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M4S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3068","dislikeCount":"621","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"42071","viewCount":"906898"}},{"id":"ZvgDorJU21E","snippet":{"description":"I made this video about 6 months ago, where I went over the most profitable savings account you could get\u2026since then, rates have changed, and here is an updated version with the newest amounts - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFirst, we have my long time personal favorite\u2026Ally Bank. \nI\u2019ve used Ally Bank for YEARS now and they\u2019ve been my go to in terms of banking. I run all of my rental income through this one because they allow me to have unlimited checking accounts for free, there\u2019s no fees for anything, they\u2019re FDIC insured up to $250,000\u2026and best part of all, they offer 2.2% interest with their savings account, of course, with no minimums. \n\nSecond, we have another REALLY popular online bank that might just be a littttlllee more profitable than Ally\u2026and that\u2019s Marcus by Goldman Sachs.\nThis savings account now offers 2.25% interest, no monthly maintenance fees, no minimums, they\u2019re FDIC insured up to $250,000, all around decent. However\u2026even though they pay slightly more - it doesn\u2019t appear as though you can use mobile deposit for checks directly into your savings account - which to me, is a downside. \n\nThird, if we\u2019re going to take it up a notch\u2026CIT bank, now offering 2.4% Interest. \nNot to be confused with Citi Bank.\n\nNow in order to get that rate, you need to do one of two things: either keep an average balance of $25,000 in the account - or deposit at least $100 per month. But assuming you can do one of those, they have no fees, they\u2019re FDIC insured, they\u2019re available to anyone in the United States.\n\nFourth, this one isn\u2019t listed ANYWHERE but so many people commented this on my last video so I had to mention it\u2026Redneck Bank. \nThey\u2019re offering 2.5% on their savings accounts, and 3% on their checking account, which is absolutely incredible. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\nOn their checking account, you\u2019ll get 3% interest up to the first $10,000. And then you\u2019ll get 2.5% interest in their savings account, up to $50,000. \n\nThey\u2019ve got no monthly fees, no minimums, FDIC insured, stellar customer service, and a mobile app that you can deposit checks too. \n\nFifth - this might be the best - and that would be the Wealthfront cash account. \nThey\u2019re offering 2.51% interest on their cash account, with FDIC insurance up to $1 Million Dollars. With this, there\u2019s also no fees, no minimums\u2026just a straight up account that offers 2.51% interest. After reading a LOT of their reviews, it seems like it\u2019s a REALLY good option - so I\u2019m giving it a shot, and moving some of my money over. \n\nAnd finally\u2026one last honorary mention, since everyone was commenting this on the last video\u2026Tmobile is now offering a 4% interest checking account. \nAnyone can open it up, no fees, no minimum balance\u2026just 4% interest. However, it\u2019s limited to the first $3000 only. And you must deposit $200 per month to get the 4% rate. To me, it just isn\u2019t worth it\u2026especially considering you can get 2.51% up to ANY amount, without a regular deposit per month, with wealthfront. BUT\u2026.I do want to mention it because if you have $3000 to hold in cash, and you want to get the highest rate possible\u2026this is it, even if it\u2019s a bit of a hassle. \n\nJust remember: The point of this is NOT to be a substitute for investing your money. The entire point of this is to KEEP your moneys value - or grow it a little bit - until you re-invest it elsewhere.\n\nThanks for watching! \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-21T22:30:00Z","tags":["robinhood","best savings account","high interest savings account","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make passive income","passive income 101","passive income ideas","passive income online","how to save money","how to save money fast","how i became a millionaire","wealthfront","ally bank","marcus by goldman sachs","tmobile checking","robinhood app","how to invest","how to invest your money","investing in stocks","investing in real estate"],"title":"The 5 MOST PROFITABLE Savings Accounts of 2019","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZvgDorJU21E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZvgDorJU21E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZvgDorJU21E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZvgDorJU21E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZvgDorJU21E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2837","dislikeCount":"383","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"27306","viewCount":"523452"}},{"id":"uAwOSeiO1hw","snippet":{"description":"These are 5 things I wish I knew when I was younger, and why these are important to learn - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\n\nThe first thing I wish I knew was knowing when to ask for help. \nAnd if I\u2019m any indication of what other people might thinking, then I have a feeling this one is INCREDIBLY common for most people. Learning when to ask for help is an INSANELY beneficial skill to have - plus it begins to help you become more assertive to get things done when you can effectively ask someone else for assistance. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s so important that you realize just how insignificant everything is. \nI nearly guarantee that whatever is bothering you RIGHT NOW, WILL NOT MATTER IN A YEAR FROM NOW. This took me a very, very long time to internalize\u2026but once I did, it\u2019s changed my entire mindset. When you take a step back and really think about it, everything that happens is SO insignificant in the entire universe. Our entire existence is a fraction of the blink of an eye\u2026we are so small in the entire galaxy\u2026and I don\u2019t say this make you feel worthless or anything, but this should help you realize that whatever you\u2019re going through likely isn\u2019t as big of a deal as you think, and you will be ok and move on. \n\nThird, with that, it\u2019s really important to know what to let go. \nTrust me when I say this\u2026not EVERYTHING is worth arguing over, and it\u2019s very important to learn to pick and chose your battles. Most of them are not worth it, and accomplish nothing. On the other hand, if there\u2019s something that\u2019s WORTH fighting for - that can actually have a POSITIVE impact - then do it, and it better be important. Understanding the differences is absolutely vital. \n\n\nFourth thing I wish I knew was that it\u2019s OK to fail and it\u2019s ok to be wrong. \nThe way I see it, every failure happens for a reason\u2026and I just believe that life is supposed to present certain situations to you so you can learn from them and become a better person in the long run. If something happens, I always think to myself\u2026this is really just a blessing in disguise, and I\u2019m THAT much stronger of a person because of it. I guarantee if you mess up big time, you will not make that same mistake again\u2026and you be better because of it. So embrace failing, embrace being wrong, and EXPECT it to happen - that way, you can get it out of the way quickly and keep going.\n\nAnd fifth, this one is a small one that I just want to emphasize to everyone\u2026just show up on time. \nDon\u2019t be late. Don\u2019t cancel last minute. Just make commitments\u2026and stick with them. Half the battle is LITERALLY just showing up on time\u2026it isn\u2019t always the smartest person, or the most talented who gets the opportunities\u2026sometimes it\u2019s the person who just shows up, at the right place, at the right time. And that\u2019s all there is to it. So few people ever do that\u2026that when you ARE that person who shows up, it\u2019s almost like you have super powers or something. People act SURPRISED when you show up early, because it\u2019s NOT NORMAL. And THAT\u2019S how you get ahead. \n\nAnd the more times you show up on time, the more likely you are to put yourself in situations for opportunity. And if you want to show up early, here is a very subtle reminder to hit the notification bell - so you can be here as soon as the video posts, and I\u2019m always here the first hour answering comments. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-19T22:30:02Z","tags":["investing","investing 101","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","investing in stocks for beginners","investing in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to make passive income","passive income strategies","passive income ideas","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to save money","how to save money fast","5 things i wish I knew","real estate","real estate tips"],"title":"What I wish I knew as a Teenager","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uAwOSeiO1hw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uAwOSeiO1hw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uAwOSeiO1hw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uAwOSeiO1hw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uAwOSeiO1hw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M55S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1844","dislikeCount":"216","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16458","viewCount":"160742"}},{"id":"K4PcktiJdgg","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about the holy grail of business, investing, and financial independence: How To Make Passive Income With $1000. \n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nNow the FIRST method is probably the most common, it\u2019s also the most EASY\u2026and that\u2019s using $1000 to buy Dividend Stocks. \nA stock pretty much represents a small ownership in a company. And in exchange for being a very, very, VERY small owner in the company - you get a tiny amount of their earnings, which is usually paid out every 4 months as a dividend. And when it comes to dividend stocks, there\u2019s no shortage of them out there with varying degrees of profit.\n\nWeBull Link: https:\/\/activity.webull.com\/landing\/index.html?cs=a&s=GrahamS\n\nNow the SECOND way to make passive income for $1000 is my personal favorite, and this is what I do\u2026and that\u2019s an INDEX FUND. \nAn index fund is basically a collection of companies and stocks that you can buy into, so you own a small percentage of EVERYTHING. I personally like index funds because they\u2019re extremely diversified, they don\u2019t cost a lot of money, they tend to be stable, consistent, and most index funds perform BETTER than even professional hedge fund managers. \n\nSPEAKING of real estate\u2026the third way of making passive income with $1000 is buying into a REIT. \nThis stands for Real Estate Investment Trust\u2026so just like being able to buy a stock in a company, imagine this like you\u2019re buying a stock in a property. Real estate investment trusts basically pool money from investors, buy up properties within a certain category - like medical buildings, shopping centers, senior citizen centers, or residential apartment buildings\u2026and then pay out a portion of their profit as a dividend.\n\nNow the fourth way to make passive income with $1000 is to look into bonds. \nCompanies, states, governments, and so on, will offer you a chance to invest in THEM\u2026and they will pay YOU back with interest for giving them a loan. They set the terms of the investment, and it\u2019s up to you to invest in them or not. Typically, bonds might have a holding period of a few months to 10 years or more\u2026the choice is up to you in terms of what you want to invest in. \n\nNow those were some VERY simple ways you could start making some passive income with $1000 that pretty much ANYONE can do, that take no work whatsoever, and are fairly safe\u2026but if you\u2019re willing to put in some work, $1000 IS enough to get started with a few other projects:\n\nFirst, obviously, is a YouTube channel. \nHere\u2019s the thing with YouTube: it\u2019s very much an ACTIVE business. You spend a LOT of time growing your audience, perfecting your message, interacting with everyone, honing your skills, and editing\u2026endless editing. And it\u2019s continuous if you want to GROW\u2026the youtube algorithm rewards consistency, so you MUST keep posting. BUT\u2026once you get a backlog of videos up on the site, and you become monetized\u2026you can make SO much money from a $1000 investment. \n\nSECOND, with $1000, you should be able to make some VERY good passive income through affiliate marketing. \nAgain, this is something I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to mention because it takes WORK to get this up and running\u2026but for someone willing to put in that work, it\u2019s absolutely worth it. With affiliate marketing, you spend the time to market someone else\u2019s product and you get paid a percentage of what you bring in. Amazon affiliates is the easiest one\u2026you basically have the entire catalog of amazon to chose from, and you\u2019ll get paid a commission for bringing people to the site when they place an order. \n\nBut like I said, overall, for passive income - $1000 is the RIGHT amount JUST to get started and to dip your toes in the water to see what it\u2019s all about.

Or, in layman\u2019s terms\u2026it\u2019s basically just their version of a secured credit card: \n\nLink to the $40 Gift Card Offer: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/iss\/credit\/creditbuilder?pr=conplcc\n\nHere\u2019s how this works: Credit Cards are given to people who have a proven track record of being able to repay their debts\u2026this could be in the form of an auto loan, a mortgage payment, or most commonly\u2026money spent on a credit card. But here\u2019s the weird catch-22 that makes absolutely no sense in our backwards credit scoring system\u2026in order to GET credit, you must first HAVE credit. But no one will GIVE you credit, unless you already HAVE credit. \n\nThe solution to this, for anyone who wants to build up their credit score, is by getting a secured credit card. That is what Amazon decided to go for, and here\u2019s how their card will work:\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll determine what your credit limit will be.  \nThis just depends on how large of a deposit you submit\u2026you can give them anywhere from $100 to $1000, and that will be your new credit line.\n\nSecond, after you get your credit card, just make your payments on time. \nIt sounds common sense\u2026but I need to say this. Always pay your credit card on time. This will will help build your credit score. \n\nThird, after 7 months, your account will be reviewed to see if you\u2019re eligible for an upgrade to an unsecured card. \nIf this happens, your deposit will be returned and you\u2019ll just graduate to the \u201cnormal\u201d Amazon Prime Credit Card - potentially with a higher credit limit. \n\nNow what makes this one DIFFERENT from almost every other secured credit card out there, is that they actually give you a small sign up bonus and some perks:\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll get a $40 gift card for signing up\nSecond, you\u2019ll get 5% back on Amazon purchases if you have Amazon Prime\nAnd third\u2026it\u2019s not really a perk, but there\u2019s no annual fee. So being free is nice\u2026I always like free. \n\nBut now, here\u2019s the TRILLION DOLLAR Amazon question\u2026how good is this card, compared to what else is already out there? \n\nFor instance, we have my personal favorite that I always recommend to everyone here just building their credit: The Discover It Secured. \nThis one gives you unlimited 1% cash back on all purchases, and 2% cash back at gas stations and restaurants. With a $0 annual fee. \n\nSo when you compare the Amazon Credit Card with the Discover It Credit Card\u2026I actually think The Amazon Card is now a slightly better choice, IF you do a lot of shopping on Amazon. \n\nAnd overall..like I said, I think it\u2019s a decent card. If you\u2019re just building your credit score, I\u2019d RECOMMEND getting this card\u2026and that\u2019s something I don\u2019t say often, besides with the Discover It Secured. And the fact that they offer better cash back AND a sign up bonus of a $40 gift card makes it better than the Apple Credit Card purely from a rewards standpoint, especially if you shop on Amazon\u2026and you have no credit to begin with. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-12T22:30:00Z","tags":["credit card","credit card churning","credit cards for beginners","secured credit cards","amazon credit card","how to improve your credit score","how to improve your credit score fast","how to improve your credit fast","credit score increase","credit score explained","credit score to buy a house","credit score to buy a car","credit score dave ramsey","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","personal finance"],"title":"Amazon Just Launched A New Credit Card\u2026","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SDN6aqmhgF0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SDN6aqmhgF0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SDN6aqmhgF0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SDN6aqmhgF0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SDN6aqmhgF0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2011","dislikeCount":"319","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"15926","viewCount":"266405"}},{"id":"FFrRkNuhnAs","snippet":{"description":"Thanks to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring.

By seeing this firsthand, you\u2019ll be able to better optimize your budget - cut back in certain areas - and have more money left over that you can invest with. \n\nSecondly, and I know it sounds cliche, but pay yourself first. \nThis gets you in the habit of prioritizing what\u2019s most important here\u2026YOU. It\u2019s getting in the habit of you treating yourself, your investments, and your retirement as basically the #1 bill you MUST pay every month. And this just increases the likelihood that you\u2019ll actually save that amount. \n\nThird, be VERY aware of lifestyle inflation.\nThis is what happens when you slowly start to make more money over time, and you slowly start to treat yourself a little more. Maybe you get a promotion and get just a slightly nicer place. Maybe you start eating out at slightly nicer restaurants. Maybe you starting buying new clothes slightly more often. Nothing overly noticeable overnight\u2026but over time, it adds up. \n\nFourth, ANYTIME you invest - have a long term outlook. \nThis is really FOUNDATION to investing and making money. For the majority of people, market timing doesn\u2019t work. There have been study, after study, after study which prove that even the best HEDGE FUNDS in the world cannot beat the average return of the SP500\u2026and lets be real, if THEY can\u2019t do it consistently over 10 years, what makes you think you\u2019ll have a shot at it? Having a long term outlook also tends to have better tax advantages, too.\n\nFifth, when it comes to investing - Invest your time FIRST, money second. \nJumping in right off the bat with a huge cash investment isn\u2019t ALWAYS the smartest choice to make. Sometimes it\u2019s a lot better to invest your time upfront learning about something, or trying it out firsthand before you dump cash into it. There\u2019s always a chance that you decide your time and money might just be better spent elsewhere once you begin learning more about it. Plus, even if you have NO MONEY right now and don\u2019t know where you start, you have time to invest.\n\nSixth, the BIGGEST piece of advice I can give you is that IF you want to make a LOT of money, you need to do something that pays on results, NOT time. \nANYTIME you\u2019re getting paid by the hour, there\u2019s ALWAYS a limit to how much you can make. You can only physically work so many hours in a day, until your income plateaus very quickly. Getting paid on RESULTS, however, means that your income has NO LIMIT - which can result in a VERY high income, very quickly. I also like that, when you get paid for results, you have DIRECT control of how much you money you make. Controlling your income and making more becomes MUCH more difficult to do. \n\nSeventh, my personal favorite - if there\u2019s something you want to buy, make your investments pay for it. \nIf you follow this one piece of advice, you will NEVER run out of money - and this is how I\u2019ve built my entire lifestyle, pretty much. Find a way for everything you buy to make its money back and pay for itself. Then suddenly, almost everything you do is now an investment. \n\nJust remember - something like this takes A LONG time to do - don\u2019t expect this to happen overnight. But if you begin PLANNING this mindset now and following everything that I\u2019ve mentioned so far, it\u2019s absolutely something you can achieve LATER if you stay disciplined with your finances, live below your means, invest EVERYTHING, and do this consistently. \n\nOh, and I lied\u2026one more\u2026ideally, in terms of making money, do something you enjoy doing. \nYou should be so enthusiastic about what you\u2019re doing to the point where it just becomes FUN, and also happens to make money. Unless you enjoy what you do, you\u2019ll get burnt out and quit. Finding something you LOVE doing means that you can work indefinitely without feeling burnt out or deprived of something in your life. And by doing so, chances are, you\u2019ll make a lot more money. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-10T22:30:00Z","tags":["investing for beginners","investing in stocks for beginners","investing in real estate","investing 101","invest your money","investing in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make passive income","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income for beginners","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to become a millionaire","how I became a millionaire","index fund investing"],"title":"7 Highly Effective Habits of Making Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FFrRkNuhnAs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FFrRkNuhnAs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FFrRkNuhnAs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FFrRkNuhnAs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FFrRkNuhnAs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1810","dislikeCount":"277","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19004","viewCount":"311595"}},{"id":"X2yRSuO77hg","snippet":{"description":"I\u2019ve gotten way too many comments asking about what I think of relationships vs working a career, so here is a video addressing it - enjoy!

Here are my thoughts, backed up by data and research. Enjoy. Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMerch: http:\/\/www.GrahamStephanStore.com\/\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nAccording to The Modern Wealth Survey conducted by Charles Schwab, the average number that someone felt they\u2019d need to consider themselves \u201cwealthy\u201d is $2,270,000. \n\nNow first of all, lets look at this objectively\u2026$2,300,000 dollars IS a lot of money. Considering that the median net worth of the average US household is just under $100,000\u2026at $2.3 million, you\u2019re doing SIGNIFICANTLY better compared to most people.  \n\nHowever\u2026when it comes to feeling \u201crich,\u201d here are a few things that some people don\u2019t consider:\n\nThe first is cost of living. \nFor example, in New York\u2026$2.3 million dollars is REALLY equivalent to about $1,960,000 in terms of what you get for your money. \nWhereas in Mississippi, $2.3 million dollars is REALLY equivalent to $2,610,000 in terms of what you get. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/how-far-does-1-go-in-your-state-2016-08-10\n\nThis is also backed up by another study by Charles Schwab which found that, in Charolette North Carolina, $1.8 million was the amount needed to feel wealthy. But if you move to San Fransisco, and that amount jumps to $4.2 million. \nhttps:\/\/www.supermoney.com\/2016\/05\/much-money-take-considered-rich-us\/\n\nNOW SECONDLY\u2026when looking at a sizable sum like $2.3 million dollars, it\u2019s a lot less important to focus on the total amount you have, but instead how much that money will realistically last you for the rest of your lifetime. \n\nLike I mentioned earlier, $2.3 million invested should be able to safely generate an income between $55,000 and $90,000 per year conservatively, depending on where it\u2019s invested, for the rest of your lifetime without you ever having to worry about running out. However, feeling \u201crich\u201d earning between $55,000 to $90,000 annually doesn\u2019t quite cut it according to surveys, apparently\u2026\n\nThis is because according to a study by YouGov, MOST people surveyed felt that someone earning $90,000 a year was \u201cneither rich, nor poor.\u201d And earning $100,000 or more per year became the crossing point where 56% of people surveyed felt like that would make them \u201cRich.\u201d  \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/01\/23\/how-much-money-americans-think-you-need-to-make-to-be-rich.html\n\nAnd what\u2019s even more surprising is that throughout ALL income brackets under $150,000\u2026less than 10% of them felt rich. This was the same result when they surveyed people earning $40,000 per year as it was for people earning over $90,000 per year\u2026despite how much they make, 90% don\u2019t feel like they make enough to consider themselves rich. \n\nThe reason behind this, is that we ALWAYS compare our income with those who are doing better than us, and how much money we make quickly just becomes our new \u201cnormal.\u201d A poll was conducted several years ago that highlights this perfectly\u2026\n\nAlmost HALF of the people earning $30,000-$49,000 per year felt that making $100,000-$500,000 per year would make them rich. But if you asked people earning over $100,000 per year what income THEY would feel rich at, nearly HALF of those people felt like they\u2019d need to make more than $500,000 per year to consider themselves \u201crich.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/www.brookings.edu\/opinions\/wealth-inequality-and-the-me-im-not-rich-problem\/\n\nBasically, YouGov found that the more money you make - the higher the bar is set, and the more you need to make to think of yourself as \u201cRich.\u201d https:\/\/today.yougov.com\/topics\/economy\/articles-reports\/2019\/01\/13\/how-much-money-do-you-need-earn-year-be-rich\n\nThis isn\u2019t just my opinion, either\u2026more studies have shown that even once you reach MILLIONAIRE status, that the majority of them now believe it\u2019s $7 MILLION to feel wealthy:\nhttps:\/\/outline.com\/VbRtSG\n\nAt the end of the day, feeling \u201crich\u201d is a state of mind NOT characterized by numbers, but instead by your own gratitude for appreciating what you have. This very much goes in line with the saying: wherever you go, there you are. That\u2019s why I believe having $2.3 million is enough to BE rich\u2026but not enough to FEEL it once you\u2019re there.

You have the the cost of college rising faster than my investments, combined with a nearly 300% increase in college graduates, combined with abysmal wage growth\u2026all blended together with parental pressure to go into DEBT for a degree that no longer has the prestige it once did. \n\nAnd this is where the issue begins\u2026most millennial are starting out their career IN DEBT, with more interest accruing every day, with almost non existent wage growth\u2026and I\u2019m not surprised to see how their net worth has dropped 34% since 1996. \n\nSECONDLY\u2026we need to address the inefficiencies of making money. \nFrom what I see, we\u2019re slowly entering an era where jobs are much less applied for\u2026instead, they\u2019re created. With the prolificness of the internet, I\u2019m seeing more and more people opt to start their own businesses rather than work for someone else. \n\nAnd by following that, people are overlooking the obvious:\nThat starting your own business, or pursuing a trade, or honing a skill can have a MUCH HIGHER ROI than a 4 year college degree. \n\nNow I understand this is a very one-sided argument\u2026I know what people are going to say. \n\nFirst, not everyone can be an entrepreneur. \nI agree. If becoming an entrepreneur is not your thing, don\u2019t do it. If you prefer something more practicable, a steady paycheck might be better choice. However, be VERY considerate about where you go to college and how much that costs. Perhaps consider 2 years of community college and then transfer to complete the last 2 years to save on cost. \n\nOR\u2026look into a trade school. There are PLENTY of trades that will ALWAYS be in demand that make a LOT of money. \nContractors, electricians, plumbers, welders\u2026even just learning how to code could be an invaluable skill. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m sure people will say there are benefits of college that aren\u2019t just financial. \nI\u2019m not here to dismiss that. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of social benefits, and just overall life experience benefits of going to school that can help considerably - but I also believe there are JUST as many, if not MORE benefits of not going, and being FORCED to put yourself out there and make things happen - otherwise nothing will happen. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s really just about evaluating both the ROI of a college degree from the financial standpoint, and the realities that making making in 2019 is changing dramatically. When you can make more in a MONTH than a doctor makes in a year by selling wolf mugs on Facebook\u2026.then you know things are changing up quickly. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-06-03T22:30:00Z","tags":["investing for beginners","investing in stocks for beginners","stock market investing for beginners","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money down","how to make money","how to make money online","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","how to invest money","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","millenial money","financial independence","real estate investing 101","stock market investing 101"],"title":"Why Millennial Net Worth Dropped -34%","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TJNlnRRQ5pw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TJNlnRRQ5pw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TJNlnRRQ5pw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TJNlnRRQ5pw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TJNlnRRQ5pw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M17S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2794","dislikeCount":"218","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11964","viewCount":"202659"}},{"id":"kebonpz4bD0","snippet":{"description":"Here are my Top 5 Favorite Investing Apps in 2019 - and each of their pros and cons.

That\u2019s right, I said it\u2026it\u2019s FREE. \n\nNow, I will say, this app is NOT perfect, and there are a few small downsides I see:\n1. I\u2019ve heard customer service is lacking in the event you have any issues. For this reason, I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend trading with a HUGE amount of money if you\u2019re going to be using this\n2. You\u2019re not able to purchase fractional shares\u2026this isn\u2019t the end of the world, but it would be nice to be able to get fractional shares if you can. \n3. No dividend re-invest (DRIP)\n4. No retirement accounts\n\nSECOND: M1 Finance: https:\/\/m1finance.8bxp97.net\/c\/2219471\/696710\/10646\nM1 Finance is an investment app with\u2026my favorite\u2026NO FEES. Now since I\u2019m reviewing this second to Robinhood, I should note a major difference between the two:\n\nRobinhood is an app that\u2019s GREAT for trading stocks\u2026if you\u2019re buying and selling all day, Robinhood is the best choice. \n\nA HUGE benefit to using M1 Finance is that they allow you to buy Fractional Shares. The other benefit with this is that they allow dividend re-investing, which allows you to continually purchase more stocks with the money those stocks generate. \n\nIf there\u2019s ANY downside here, it\u2019s that it\u2019s not really the ideal platform for DAY TRADING stocks\u2026this is because they don\u2019t allow you to buy and sell a stock within the same day..\nhttps:\/\/support.m1finance.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/221053447-Buy-and-Sell-the-Same-Security-in-a-Day\n\nSo overall, I\u2019m super happy with M1 Finance and would recommend this as a good app to use.\n\nTHIRD: Acorns Investing\nSign up and get $5: https:\/\/acorns.com\/invite\/GK4CWW\n Acorns is an an app that helps automate your investing. And their most notable feature, in my opinion, would be their \u201cround up\u201d feature - this lets you invest the spare change from what you spend, and you can just \u201cround up\u201d every single purchase to the nearest dollar to invest the difference. \n\nOverall, this is a REALLY decent app if just for the round-up feature alone. However, the downside is that the $1 per month charge heavily eats into your profit if you only happen to have a few hundred dollars invested, or ONLY use it for the round up feature. \n\nBut, once you have more than $5000 invested in Acorns, the $1 per month fee is pretty much on par with Vanguard, and beyond that dollar amount, they even become CHEAPER. \n\nFOURTH: WeBull\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThis one is fairly similar to Robinhood in the sense that it\u2019s a free stock trading app where you can buy and sell stocks with ZERO commissions\u2026and on the surface, they\u2019re very much alike. \n\nBut where WeBull really pulls ahead of Robinhood, is in their charts\u2026as you begin to get more serious into stock trading, WeBull just offers a lot more with their analytics. \n\nOverall, if I were to say anything negative about them - I would just say that it takes a little bit to figure out how to navigate the app and their charts, but for a free stock trading app, I\u2019d highly recommend it. \n\nFIFTH: Fidelity Investing\nThe reason I like this so much is that their app allows you to invest without any minimums, without any fees, into many of their completely free index funds\u2026so everything within this is totally free. \n\nNow I need to mention, this is NOT good to use if you\u2019re looking to buy and sell individual stocks - because they will charge you a $4.95 commission per trade. So don\u2019t ever do that when you could just use M1 Finance, WeBull, or Robinhood to do that for nothing\u2026BUT, if you\u2019re looking to invest in their own index funds\u2026which most of you should be doing\u2026this is ideal.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-31T22:30:00Z","tags":["best investing apps","robinhood app","robinhood app review","m1 finance","m1 finance review","betterment","betterment review","stash app review","webull","webull review","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in stocks for beginners","stock market investing","stock market investing for beginners","real estate investing","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"The Top 5 BEST Investing Apps","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kebonpz4bD0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kebonpz4bD0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kebonpz4bD0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kebonpz4bD0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kebonpz4bD0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4573","dislikeCount":"805","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"65267","viewCount":"926757"}},{"id":"w-ZmLcBKUZo","snippet":{"description":"How To Stop Being Lazy: Watch this video, follow these 5 steps, and suddenly get motivated by actually doing stuff. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nSecond Channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCa-ckhlKL98F8YXKQ-BALiw\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFirst, it\u2019s important to recognize that feeling lazy is totally NORMAL. \nUnless your Gary Vaynerchuk. In which case, you should get that checked out\u2026but besides that, being lazy happens to EVERYONE, and it happens way more than people would like to admit. Recognizing that this happens is just a part of moving on from this, and not wallowing in self-pity or thinking that you aren\u2019t good enough for something, or that you\u2019ve just wasted so much time, so what\u2019s a little more laziness\u2026because THAT just makes things SO MUCH worse. So accept that it\u2019s normal, it happens to everyone, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you, and that\u2019ll allow you on to the next step. \n\nSecond, DO NOT overthink things. \nThis is probably the BIGGEST hurdle people have when they\u2019re presented with something they should be doing, but they\u2019re not in the mood to get it done\u2026people OVER THINK about it. Meanwhile, your subconscious slowly ruminates on the task, and mentally transforms it from something that would\u2019ve been an easy thing to get done, into the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest while not having gotten off of your couch for years. \n\nThe LESS thinking you do about it, the better. As soon as you catch yourself \u201cTHINKING\u201d of how much you don\u2019t want to do something, cut that out immediately\u2026it does absolutely nothing productive, and it wastes mental energy that you could\u2019ve just spent actually getting it done. So don\u2019t think.\n\nThird: START DOING WHAT YOU NEED TO IMMEDIATELY. \nJust try out this out: anytime you\u2019re feeling lazy, don\u2019t think\u2026just immediately start doing it. Start so quick that your mind doesn\u2019t even have time to process what you\u2019re actually doing\u2026then by the time you\u2019re doing it, you\u2019ll already feel more motivated to finish what you started. \n\nPlus, something amazing happens once you just start\u2026somehow you end up getting motivated, just because you\u2019re beginning to see the end result of finishing what you started. \n\nFourth, Break it down into smaller tasks that seem more manageable. \nThis way, nothing ever gets overwhelming, and you\u2019re less likely to mentally use the excuse of \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d Each step, by itself, is usually pretty simple\u2026so use that to your advantage. It\u2019s the equivalent of just focusing on the next step, the next 10 minutes, the next small task\u2026and doing that repetitively without looking too far ahead\u2026and then before you know it, you\u2019ll have a video like this fully filmed and edited, even though you started off by not wanting to do anything today! \n\nFifth, GET RID OF DISTRACTIONS\nDo your best to identify your biggest time wasters\u2026and then cancel them out so they\u2019ll no longer be a distraction. Identifying what these points are, and then CANCELING THEM OUT, makes doing EVERYTHING ELSE so much easier. \n\nAnd finally, it\u2019s really important to realize that beyond all of this, the motivation to do something is always going to be a fleeting feeling, and relying on \u201cfeeling motivated\u201d is going to be completely unreliable. Instead, what\u2019ll make the biggest difference, is just this: DISCIPLINE. \n\nIt\u2019s just the discipline to stick with this, no matter what happens\u2026no matter if you feel lazy, no matter if you\u2019re wasting time on instagram, no matter if you haven\u2019t even smashed the like button already. Consistency is absolutely everything, and that\u2019s the ONLY WAY to ever get long lasting results. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-29T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to stop being lazy","how to stop being lazy and unmotivated","how to get motivated","how to make money","how to make money fast","how to make money online","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","stock market investing","stock market investing for beginners","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to make passive income","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to invest in your 20s","passive income 101"],"title":"How To Stop Being Lazy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/w-ZmLcBKUZo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/w-ZmLcBKUZo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/w-ZmLcBKUZo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/w-ZmLcBKUZo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/w-ZmLcBKUZo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2149","dislikeCount":"307","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"24365","viewCount":"299352"}},{"id":"WIkuxRaHLcE","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss Betterment and their 2.69% savings account, and whether or not this could be worth it - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nSecond Channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCa-ckhlKL98F8YXKQ-BALiw\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nBetterment is what\u2019s called a \u201cRobo Advisor,\u201d which asks you questions based on your savings, earnings, and investing goals\u2026and then they\u2019ll build you a portfolio tailored to your situation. This is perfect for beginners, who are often overwhelmed by all the investment options out there, and just want a simple, easy approach to making their money make more money. \n\nIn terms of WHAT Betterment invests in, it\u2019s pretty much a broad selection of index funds through Vanguard, along with a few other ETFs.\n\nWhen it comes to this, Betterment charges you a 0.25% Management Fee on your money. And I\u2019m personally NOT a fan of 0.25% management fees. This fee is over 6x HIGHER than what Vanguard charges for their VTI fund. \n\nNow, I will admit\u2026Betterment has ONE advantage over Vanguard, because they can automatically do what\u2019s called Tax Loss Harvesting. In a PERFECT scenario, the tax benefits from tax loss harvesting COULD pay for their 0.25% management fee and make it worth it.\n\nBut in terms of their savings account: \nThere are zero fees and zero minimum balances. Money in this account is also FDIC insured up to $1 million dollars, which they\u2019re able to do by spreading your money throughout several partner banks. \n\nHowever, in order to unlock the 2.69% interest rate, you\u2019ll need to sign up to be on their new checking account waitlist. But for that 2.69% interest, their fine print states this is only a promotional offer until December 31, 2019. That means, pretty much by the time I post this video, you can only get about 5 months worth of this interest rate\u2026before there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll discontinue it and lower their payout.\n\nNow of course, they make it clear this interest rate is not guaranteed and may change at any time\u2026and in their defense, Wealthfront can chose to lower it\u2019s 2.57% at any time, as could any other bank\u2026so if you DO decide to go to with Betterment and their 2.69% account, just understand that it might not be permanent, and to manage your expectations. \n\nI see this as a decent move from Betterment to increase attention to their platform, and if people move their money over to a savings accounts, they\u2019re THAT much more likely to then invest with Betterment. And then from that, Betterment is likely to receive a .25% management fee to help offset their cost. \n\nReally, at the end of the day, this is just about customer acquisition - and in order to gain a stronger audience, they MUST go above and beyond in order to stand out, which they\u2019ve done with their 2.69% savings account. But just remember, in my own opinion, paying a .25% management fee is way too high compared to MANY of the other alternatives out there\u2026and the 2.69% interest rate IS absolutely incredible, but it\u2019s not guaranteed to last\u2026and that small difference is something VERY important that everyone should understand, just to be able to manage your expectations of what to expect. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-26T22:30:00Z","tags":["betterment","betterment review","betterment savings account","betterment app","betterment vs wealthfront","best savings account","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","stock market investing","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing 101","passive income","how to make money","how to make money online","investing for beginners","investing 101","robinhood app"],"title":"The #1 PROBLEM with Betterment Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WIkuxRaHLcE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WIkuxRaHLcE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WIkuxRaHLcE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WIkuxRaHLcE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WIkuxRaHLcE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M17S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1204","dislikeCount":"233","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10902","viewCount":"156433"}},{"id":"uf-cFhbpNc0","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s exactly what I think of the current real estate market, how to invest in real estate in 2019, and whether or not prices might go down - enjoy!

Real Estate is the exact same way. Real estate prices are heavily influenced by specific market conditions of demand, proximity to employment, and current supply of inventory\u2026this will vary DRAMATICALLY from Location to Location. \n\nSecond, in terms of housing PRICES themselves - it\u2019s important to distinguish that MANY real estate markets STILL have not recovered from their previous all time highs once you account for inflation. \nhttps:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4097882-definitely-housing-bubble\n\nPrices just naturally rise over time, and as markets continue to develop, we\u2019re going to constantly be reaching all time highs\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily over valued. Same applies to the stock market, we\u2019re going to naturally continue hitting all time highs\u2026and that isn\u2019t a reason NOT to buy a home. It\u2019s just a normal cycle where prices will continually get more expensive over time. \n\nThird, a MAJOR point the article missed is that for most people, the value of their home isn\u2019t going to really make much of a difference in the short term:\nFor EVERYONE who\u2019s buying a home with the intention to live in it for 10 years or more, then price it\u2019s worth within the next few years makes absolutely no difference whatsoever, when you aren\u2019t selling. I think that\u2019s the most difficult part for people to understand, because EVERYONE thinks to themselves: I want to wait for prices to drop first, THEN I can buy something!! \n\nInstead, anytime you\u2019re buying real estate, the #1 thing you can do is buy with the intention of holding it long term. \n\nSecondly, and this is common sense, but you\u2019d be surprised\u2026only buy something that you can comfortably afford on a fixed payment. \n\nThird, do your best to buy a property under market value.\n\nAnd fourth\u2026if you\u2019re buying something as an INVESTMENT where you plan to make money from it\u2026CASHFLOW IS KING, not necessarily the value of the property in relation to what you paid. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-24T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate 101","real estate investing strategies","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","investing in real estate","investing for beginners","how to invest in your 20s","how to make passive income","passive income 101","passive income ideas","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","real estate prediction","how to invest in stocks","stock market investing"],"title":"Are Real Estate Prices about to Collapse?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uf-cFhbpNc0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uf-cFhbpNc0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uf-cFhbpNc0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uf-cFhbpNc0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uf-cFhbpNc0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1877","dislikeCount":"559","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19715","viewCount":"394110"}},{"id":"_0DsgWYPerw","snippet":{"description":"Lets review Stash Investing, how it works, and the reasons why I won\u2019t be investing with them - enjoy!

Like if you have $4000 with Stash, you\u2019re paying $12 per year just as a fee for investing. If you invest more than $5000, their management fee lowers $1 per month to 0.25%.\n\nAgain, it might not SEEM like a lot\u2026but when you consider Vanguard charges 0.04%, Fidelity charges NOTHING, and even Acorns just charges a flat $1 per month up to a million dollars invested\u2026stash is very, very expensive at 0.25%. So from THAT perspective alone, I\u2019m absolutely not a fan of it.\u00a0\nThey offer what\u2019s called Stock Back - this is a feature where they will give you BACK a fraction of a stock on what you purchase, as a reward for using the debit card. According to them: \u201cUpon a qualifying debit card purchase, you will earn a fractional share of Stock. \u00a0Stock reward amounts will be a dollar amount equal to 0.125% of the aggregate amount of the qualifying purchase, or, if greater, a fixed dollar amount of $0.01 per qualifying purchase.\u201c\n\nSo if you spend $100 with Amazon\u2026you\u2019re getting back a whopping 12.5 CENTS in stock. 12.5 CENTS!! Just get a 2% Citi Double Cash Card\u2026and when you spend $100, you\u2019ll get $2 back!! That\u2019s $1.87 cents MORE for the same purchase, than with Stash.\u00a0\n\nAs usual, I should just say this: it\u2019s better to do SOMETHING than nothing\u2026so if Stash gets you investing, even if it costs you a higher amount every month\u2026it\u2019s BETTER than not doing anything at all, and not investing. \n\nBut\u2026for EVERYONE ELSE with even a moderate amount of self control and don\u2019t mind spending an extra 5 minutes doing their own research\u2026there are many, many, MANY cheaper options for what you get.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s great that people are getting excited about investing, but there are sooooo many cheaper alternatives out there that it just isn\u2019t worth it from that perspective. And I hope they can improve their reward and pricing tiers so I can review it again and give it something a little better.\u00a0\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-22T22:30:00Z","tags":["stash","stash investing","stash investing review","stash app review","stash app","acorns investing","acorns app","acorns investment app","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in stocks for beginners","stock market investing","stock market 101","how to invest in real estate","index fund investing","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","robinhood app","roth ira","how to invest in your 20s","passive income","passive income 101","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"Why I\u2019ll never use Stash investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_0DsgWYPerw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_0DsgWYPerw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_0DsgWYPerw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_0DsgWYPerw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_0DsgWYPerw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2519","dislikeCount":"482","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"40180","viewCount":"363954"}},{"id":"V9X30VkLRtY","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s exactly how the tax system works and how much I\u2019d spend on taxes throughout my 7 incomes sources - enjoy!

So hopefully this brings some clarification to everyone watching - and answer your own curiosity as to how much my tax bill is..\n\nYou first have whats called your federal tax bracket, which is how much you owe the IRS, depending how much money you make. \n\nIn addition to that, we\u2019ve got state income taxes depending on how much net income you have. \n\nThird, the income I make may be considered \u201cself employment income,\u201d meaning it\u2019s subject to self employment taxes\u2026which, here in the United States, is an ADDITIONAL tax rate of 15.3%.\n\nThe REALITY is that self employed business owners have the benefit of getting a LOT of tax deductions and write offs available to them to bring down their taxable income.\n\nThis encourages business owners to not only continually re-invest back into their business to reduce their tax bill, but also give them more PROFIT left over that will *hopefully* circulate back into the economy, whether they invest in real estate, buy stocks, spend more on avocado toast and 20 cent coffee\u2026\n\nI think this also ENCOURAGES people to start their own businesses, because you can fully utilize the tax code as its meant to be used.\n\nIn addition to that, if you\u2019re self employed, you can chose to open up what\u2019s called an S-Corporation. I have this setup, where all of my income and expenses first go through the corporation, and then to me SEPARATELY as an employee of that business. \n\nSo in terms of how much money I\u2019d pay in taxes\u2026It really depends on what my gross income is at the end of the year, and how much of that I chose to re-invest back into the business as a write off. At a certain point in my tax bracket, it makes sense to purchase a better youtube studio, buy better equipment, and purchase things that will improve this channel in such a way that also lowers my tax liability.\n\nAnd if there\u2019s any take away from this entire video, it\u2019s this:\n\nThe reality of making money and becoming wealthy FIRST begins with saving money. \n\nBut when you get to the point where you cannot feasibly save ANY MORE MONEY, THAT is when you need to begin MAKING MORE MONEY.\n\nBut THEN you get to a point where you\u2019re making a sizable income, and TAX REDUCTION becomes just as important as SAVING MONEY. These are strategies to KEEP the money you make, because the money you KEEP can be GREATER than the money you earn. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-19T22:30:00Z","tags":["investing","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","how to invest","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to save on taxes","passive income","passive income for beginners","passive income online","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to make money how to make money fast","tax write offs"],"title":"How much I pay in taxes on a $163,800 per month income","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V9X30VkLRtY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V9X30VkLRtY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V9X30VkLRtY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V9X30VkLRtY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V9X30VkLRtY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M23S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5540","dislikeCount":"1063","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"61349","viewCount":"857423"}},{"id":"KrKAJ-06-Ys","snippet":{"description":"By request, here\u2019s a breakdown of how much I spend every month on my personal expenses, and what I spend my money on - enjoy!

Don\u2019t focus so much on the end number, but instead, the processes to get there - and the philosophies behind it\n\nFIRST: YouTube Ad Revenue. \nThis is something I NEVER imagined could be a reality, but here we are\u2026and this single channel alone is now generating over $100,000 per month. That\u2019s with no employees, no overhead expenses, no advertising\u2026it\u2019s just me, a camera, my garage, and computer\u2026that\u2019s it. I do 100% of what you see here, I just have a TON of fun doing this, and realize how unbelievable it Is to make so much money working on something you love doing. \n\nSECOND: The Graham Stephan Show. \nHere is a very obvious plug if you want to go subscribe there, I\u2019m posting every other day I don\u2019t post on this main channel - so between these two channels, I\u2019m posting every single day. And I\u2019m really happy to say that in the FIRST month of posting on The Graham Stephan Show channel, it made just over $15,000\u2026in ONE month, THE FIRST MONTH, with less than 20 uploads total\u2026that\u2019s just INSANE. \n\nTHIRD: Two programs - The Real Estate Agent Academy and The YouTube Creator Academy\nSo far, this year, it\u2019s paid off to tune of $23,500 averaged per month in 2019. Again, that\u2019s with no overhead, I don\u2019t advertise it\u2026I just place it in the description, or I might do the occasional coupon code every now and then\u2026and that\u2019s it. Here\u2019s my philosophy behind it - if I\u2019m going to sell a course like this, it NEEDS to be something I fully and completely stand behind - AND it needs to be worth MORE than what someone will pay for it. Like, I want you to get MORE value than what you pay ME\u2026that way, I know you\u2019ll be happy, I know you\u2019ll come back for OTHER things I might offer in the future, and that means a better long term outcome for everyone. \n\nFOURTH: Real Estate Agent Sales\nNow so far, in 2019, I\u2019ve sold $6.6 million worth of real estate between two properties\u2026now due to my focus here on YouTube, I split this with a colleague  who took over a portion of the work, so obviously I\u2019m not taking the full 2.5% commission on $6.6 million. I also currently have a $5.5 million listing going up today, and another for $7.5 million home that I\u2019m a co-listing agent on.\n\nFIFTH: Net Rental Income\nIn 2011 and 2012, I bought three properties\u2026it was two houses and a triplex. I kept saving my commissions as a real estate agent, and In 2016, I bought another house and fixed it up - then later rented it out. Then in 2017, I bought a duplex\u2026and in 2018, I bought another duplex. All in all now, after paying 3 mortgages, expenses, taxes, everything\u2026I\u2019m left with about $4800 per month in NET income between the 6 properties. \n\nSIXTH: Mortgage Equity Paydown\nThat also means that every month I\u2019m slowly increasing my equity in the property, and with that, my net worth. In total from the 3 mortgages, I\u2019m gaining about $2800 per month in equity on those properties to the point where after awhile, the mortgages will be paid off - the properties will be owned free and\n\nSEVENTH: Savings Account Interest\nI\u2019m going to leave this one a little vague because I don\u2019t want to paint a target on my back, but I\u2019m saving up for another property right now and that money generates about $1700 per month in interest within a savings account. This isn\u2019t going to be the case a year from now, but my whole thing is that I\u2019ll just save away everything I make in a high yield savings account - and when I get enough, and find the right deal, I\u2019ll buy a property. \n\nEIGHT: Amazon Affiliates Commission. \nThis typically averages anywhere from $600 on the low end, to $1400 on the high end - but recently, it\u2019s averaged about $1000 per month. \n\nAnd I really want to thank you again for all of your continued support, because if it wasn\u2019t for you, none of this would be possible\u2026and in return, I promise to always be honest, always try to do my best to provide something of value, and hopefully we can all make more money together and be super mega rich one day off 20 cent iced coffee, and hitting the like button!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-15T22:30:00Z","tags":["passive income","passive income ideas","passive income for beginners","investing for beginners","investing strategies","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate agent","real estate agent day in the life","how to make money online","how to save money","how to save money fast","ally bank","wealthfront","robinhood","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to become a millionaire in 3 years","how to build wealth"],"title":"How I Built 7 Income Sources That Make $163,800 Per Month","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/px317izkJ6w\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/px317izkJ6w\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/px317izkJ6w\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/px317izkJ6w\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/px317izkJ6w\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT22M46S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"7195","dislikeCount":"2182","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"115225","viewCount":"1602861"}},{"id":"8YOwqDOHRUo","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss why 74% of millennial aren\u2019t buying homes or real estate investing - enjoy!

Home ownership, in that situation, doesn\u2019t make sense\u2026why tie yourself down to a property when next year you might be on the opposite side of the country?\n\nWe\u2019re also, as an entire society, slowly shifting away from owning - and into a sharing or renting economy. Why own a car you use a few times a week, when you can just uber instead? Why go to a hotel when you can AirBnb? The ability to rent just gives you more convenience, for a smaller, short term cost. \n\nBut, is renting like this really the smart financial move? Or are millennials just paying extra for the convenience of being able to move whenever they want without being tied down?\n\nObviously, if the real estate market declines, then chances are - renting becomes cheaper. And if the real estate market continues to appreciate, then BUYING becomes cheaper\u2026but overall, it\u2019s important to understand a few things when you buy a home:\n\n1. First, there is an opportunity cost to your down payment anytime you buy a house. If you\u2019re putting $50,000 down on a property, you\u2019re giving up the opportunity to invest that money elsewhere at a higher return. \n2. Second, your cost isn\u2019t just your mortgage payment\u2026it\u2019s also your property taxes, it\u2019s insurance, and it\u2019s normal property repairs which add up over time. \n3. Third, buying and selling a property is expensive\u2026between commissions and closing costs, it\u2019s about 6% of the selling price right off the top. So you\u2019ll need to sell your property 6% higher JUST to break even without coming out of pocket. \n\nOverall, however, the rule of thumb is that if you\u2019re going to be living in the property more than 8-10 years, then buying tends to be the cheaper alternative. Any less than that, and you\u2019re speculating that values will increase at such a rate to cover your costs\u2026and if they don\u2019t, you lose money. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising, at all, that millennials are less likely to buy\u2026on average, they\u2019re less likely to be in the financial position to buy than previous generations, and the expectation of buying real estate is much lower than in previous generations. The mindset has shifted towards a temporary, flexible, convenient lifestyle, and owning real estate to live in - on average - is something people do as they settle down long term. \n\nSo in the end, if millennials aren\u2019t buying\u2026that\u2019s good news for me, because as a landlord, that means they\u2019re renting. And also, it means less competition for me when I\u2019m buying real estate\u2026so all around, if you\u2019re investing, it\u2019s a win from a financial perspective. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my thoughts on what\u2019s going on and the recent trend away from buying - it\u2019s a shame so many people can\u2019t afford to own real estate, but from a lack of demand, it\u2019s a decent time to be a landlord. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-12T22:30:00Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","how to buy real estate","real estate investing 101","investing in real estate","investing in stocks","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in your 30s","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to build your credit","how to make passive income","passive income 101","passive income ideas","rental property investing"],"title":"Why  Millennials Aren\u2019t Buying Homes","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8YOwqDOHRUo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8YOwqDOHRUo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8YOwqDOHRUo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8YOwqDOHRUo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8YOwqDOHRUo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4111","dislikeCount":"870","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"36721","viewCount":"620379"}},{"id":"cr9u6Mha_rY","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss how to invest $500 per month, and the best places you can invest your money to build wealth - enjoy!

For example, if you invest $500 per month into a 401K, you\u2019ll be taxed as though you make $500 per month LESS on your paycheck. That saves you money upfront, allowing you to invest MORE money than you\u2019d have left over AFTER paying taxes. \n\nFrom my perspective, the 401k really only makes sense in a few scenarios:\n\nThe first is when your employer offers what\u2019s called a 401K match\u2026this is when they will match your contribution, dollar-for-dollar, up to a certain amount. Essentially, this means you\u2019re doubling your money immediately with zero risk whatsoever. \n\nSecondly, a 401k makes sense if you\u2019re in a HIGH tax bracket now\u2026and expect to retire on much less, in a LOWER tax bracket. The variable here is if you end up making more money in retirement, then you\u2019ll pay more in taxes LATER than you would have just paid now. And, if the tax rates go UP in retirement\u2026then you might also pay more. \n\nFOURTH: Paying down any high interest rate debt you have. \nIf you invest your money, on average, you\u2019d likely expect about a 6-12% return in a broad index fund\u2026and to do that, you\u2019re taking on some risk that there will be years where you LOSE money. On the other hand, paying down debt is like getting a guaranteed return on your money at whatever interest rate you\u2019re paying. \n\nSo paying off a 15% interest credit card balance is like getting an immediate, guaranteed 15% return on your money. Same applies to ANY outstanding loan you have. My basic rule of thumb is this: If you\u2019re paying above a 4.5% interest rate on your money, it\u2019s probably best just to pay it off, because you\u2019re getting ABOUT what an investment would generate after taxes. So there\u2019s no downside. \n\nFIFTH: Invest in yourself\nWhen we look at the ROI of investing $500 per month, in the very beginning, it\u2019s not much. Even at a 10% return within a year, we\u2019re talking about a few hundred dollars. The BEST ROI, however, comes from none other than yourself. YOU have the ability to make a few hundred dollars IN A DAY with the proper education or certification, and especially when your young, making more money can set you up on a completely new trajectory in terms of building wealth. \n\nSIXTH: A taxable account\nBy doing this, you can invest $500 per month into individual stocks or index funds you find interesting\u2026you can basically just invest your money normally, without any retirement benefits later on. BUT, by doing this, you\u2019d have access to ALL of your money, anytime you need it, without paying an penalties for cashing out before the age of 59.5 \n\nSEVENTH: Start a business\nThat might be enough to buy some basic equipment to get going, it might be enough to get a website built and order inventory, it might be enough to start up a small agency that you can run remotely, it could be enough to even just buy some landscaping equipment and start mowing lawns. The possibilities are basically limitless. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-10T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest 500","how to invest 500 per month","how to invest in stocks","how to invest with no money","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","stock market investing","stock market investing for beginners","how to build wealth","how to build wealth with no money","how to become a millionaire","investing for beginners","investing 101","how to save money","how to pay off debt","how to invest 1000","how to invest 10000","how to invest 100"],"title":"How To Invest $500 Per Month","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cr9u6Mha_rY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cr9u6Mha_rY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cr9u6Mha_rY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cr9u6Mha_rY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cr9u6Mha_rY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M21S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2741","dislikeCount":"469","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"25854","viewCount":"580702"}},{"id":"xKmJNvSvmKw","snippet":{"description":"Lets go over the BEST, common sense investing advice that is not only EASY, but it\u2019ll also stand the test of time REGARDLESS of whatever you want to invest in.

Especially when it comes to your hard earned money, it\u2019s worth it to spend an hour of research learning about your investments and whether or not it\u2019s the right option for you.\n\nThird: THERE IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN DEGREE OF RISK. \nThere is not one single investment that doesn\u2019t carry SOME level of risk, and SOME small chance of losing money\u2026even if it\u2019s a fraction of a percent chance of ever happening. Nothing is EVER certain, and nothing is EVER guaranteed\u2026Be comfortable knowing that there might be a small degree of risk in order to make money\u2026the more you understand this, the better you will be as an investor, and the better you\u2019ll be at managing that risk. \n\nFourth: Think long term whenever you\u2019re investing.\nThe reality is that, in the short term, we have much less certainty about what\u2019s going to be happening\u2026prices could go down, markets could act irrationally, and there\u2019s the chance of losing money on paper. But generally, the longer you invest\u2026 the lower your chances are of losing money\u2026this because the longer you invest, the more likely you are to weather any down periods and come out ahead in the green. \n\nFifth, any time it comes to investing, MAKE IT A CONSISTENT HABIT. \nWhen it comes to investing, you need to invest consistently, over time, on auto pilot\u2026it doesn\u2019t mean you need to be actively involved all the time, but you will need to consciously remember to set aside a portion of your income every month that goes into your investment fund.\n\nSixth, when it comes to investing, understand this concept: A dollar saved is worth $1.50 earned. \nIn order for you to have $1 right now in your pocket, you likely needed to make about $1.50 from a job, before paying taxes\u2026and before commuting costs\u2026and before other job expenses we haven\u2019t considered. Just for you to have $1 left over, after taxes. \n\nAnd finally, number seven\u2026don\u2019t get emotional about your investments. \nI you find yourself getting emotional about your investments, either you invested more money than you\u2019re comfortable with, or you didn\u2019t do your proper research to understand what you were getting into. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-08T22:30:02Z","tags":["investing","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest for beginners","investing 101","passive income","passive income 101","passive income ideas","how to make money","how to save money","how to make money online","how to make money fast","how to become a millionaire","robinhood","stock market explained","investing advice","best investing advice","graham stephan"],"title":"The Best Investing Advice of 2020","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xKmJNvSvmKw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xKmJNvSvmKw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xKmJNvSvmKw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xKmJNvSvmKw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xKmJNvSvmKw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M58S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1672","dislikeCount":"254","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13450","viewCount":"215892"}},{"id":"Y0amF_F6EvI","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss and review Acorns Investment App, go over all of its features, and whether or not it\u2019s actually a good value - Enjoy!

And their most notable feature, in my opinion, would be their \u201cround up\u201d feature - this lets you invest the spare change from what you spend, and you can just \u201cround up\u201d every single purchase to the nearest dollar to invest the difference. \n\nThey also give you the option to setup recurring investments on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis\u2026 again, the entire purpose of this app is just to help automate regular and consistent investing. They\u2019ll also let you see, real time, what your investments COULD be worth depending on your contributions\u2026so it\u2019s really meant to get you thinking about the long term. \n\nNow in terms of WHAT they invest in, they say \u201cYour investments are then diversified across more than 7,000 stocks and bonds and automatically rebalanced when the market fluctuates.\u201d So basically, they\u2019re investing in broad funds that track the market, very similar to the vanguard index funds I always talk about on the channel. \n\nAnd when it comes to this, Acorns is what\u2019s called a Robo-Advisor - this has definitely gained some popularity lately with other companies like Wealthfront, Bettermint, and M1 Finance to name a few. \n\nIf we go to their pricing tier, we can see that their basic service begins at $1 per month:\nWith that, you get the Automated investing where they round up the charge and invest the difference\n\nThen, for $2 per month, you get access to all of that, plus Acorns Later - which is their IRA. \n\nAnd finally\u2026for $3 per month, you\u2019ll get access to their checking account with debit card. \n\nSo overall, looking through everything on Acorns and spending way too much time on this\u2026here are my thoughts and what I REALLY think of it:\nAcorns simplifies investing and making it incredibly easy, to the point where you don\u2019t need to think about it. The concept of rounding up is clever, it\u2019s gimmicky, and I can see how it works. If Americans aren\u2019t going to think about investment, they can just invest on Autopilot without making any difference whatsoever except for setting up an Acorns account. So from that perspective, I really like it. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026what I consider a negative for Acorns, is that if you just want to straight up invest a small amount of money into an index fund\u2026and what to do it for TOTALLY FREE, you can do that with Fidelity. \n\nIf you\u2019re investing with more money, Acorns slowly becomes more and more worth it as the $1 fee becomes a smaller percentage of the total amount you have invested.\n\nBUT\u2026I\u2019ll admit, using Acorns is WAY better than doing nothing. For people who just can\u2019t seem to save and invest any money, or don\u2019t really take an interest to investing\u2026this is BY FAR better than the alternative of just not investing. \n\nJust my opinion, not financial advice. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-05T22:30:02Z","tags":["acorns","acorns investing","acorns investment app","acorns review","acorns vs robinhood","acorns vs stash","how to invest","investing for beginners","investing strategies","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","investing 101","investing in your 20s","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","passive income","robinhood","passive income ideas","how to retire","financial independence","roth ira","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"What you MUST know about Acorns Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Y0amF_F6EvI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Y0amF_F6EvI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Y0amF_F6EvI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Y0amF_F6EvI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Y0amF_F6EvI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M31S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"5236","dislikeCount":"2165","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"165978","viewCount":"1423769"}},{"id":"2-JOpEBew6g","snippet":{"description":"Lets debunk the highly criticized topic of personal finance: will buying coffee make you poor?

It isn\u2019t going to make a big difference in your budget, and it isn\u2019t going to prevent you from buying a property. However, I think the bigger issue isn\u2019t so much a small purchase every now and then\u2026instead, it\u2019s the cumulation of MANY small purchases, scattered throughout your day, that you just don\u2019t pay attention to, that can wreck havoc on your budget. \n\nAnd this is where I believe most people get lost: they take the \u201cdon\u2019t buy coffee\u201d advice way too literally, without understanding the deeper metaphor of what they\u2019re REALLY saying: that you CANNOT be frivolously spending money unless you can afford it, without being able to justify its value. \n\nSo will a coffee make you poor? It\u2019s Debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, if you just invested that $5 cup of coffee every day for 45 years\u2026and you got a 7% return adjusted for inflation\u2026you\u2019d have $557,000 left over at your disposal. That\u2019s the power of meticulously tracking your spending, and realizing how much it\u2019s worth in the long term - and that your $5 daily coffee is a splurge and should be treated as such. \n\nBut on the other hand, life is to be enjoyed. Life isn\u2019t about looking at numbers on a computer screen and realizing you haven\u2019t enjoyed yourself or experienced everything life has to offer.

How much money are you leaving on the table by doing so, and could you ever go BACK to making the same amount of money if you wanted to? \n\nThird, the author describes people thinking of you as a misfit for retiring early\u2026\nMaybe I\u2019m just in Los Angeles, where it seems like no one has a job and everyone just hangs out at Cafe\u2019s and Equinox all day\u2026so I\u2019ll just say, this is only one that I can\u2019t fully conceptualize quite yet. \n\nBut\u2026number 4 gets me\u2026he says, you\u2019ll be surprised that you\u2019re not THAT much happier\nThere\u2019s a saying that goes something like this: wherever you go, there you are. That applies to EVERYTHING. If you\u2019re naturally an unhappy person, that\u2019ll continue forward into retirement\u2026if you\u2019re an optimistic, happy person\u2026that\u2019ll continue forward into retirement. But don\u2019t expect retirement to solve ALL of your emotional well-being problems. \n\nAnd finally, 5, he mentions boredom\u2026\nThis one is very real\u2026I\u2019ve never \u201cRetired\u201d from anything, but if I don\u2019t have any plans, if I\u2019m not working on something, or doing SOMETHING productive\u2026I just don\u2019t feel good. I feel lethargic, I feel tired, I feel unmotivated, I don\u2019t feel challenged, and I get the feeling that I\u2019m just wasting my life. That might sound extreme, but more than a few days without doing anything and I partially go crazy\u2026I just feel like I\u2019m deteriorating. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s really the entire point of the CNBC article - that early retirement is not necessarily a cure to life\u2019s problems. It\u2019s not the light at the end of the tunnel that people make it out to be. While it can certainly solve some LOGISTICAL issues of time and money, it won\u2019t cure unhappiness - and it won\u2019t make you feel any better of a person. \n\nAnd when it comes to me, here\u2019s my thoughts and why I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be able to retire:\nTo me, the concept of \u201cretiring\u201d is leaving behind a career, or lifestyle you didn\u2019t enjoy - and escape into something new that\u2019s more fulfilling. But when it comes to that, I\u2019ve gotta say\u2026if I were retired, I\u2019d just be doing the EXACT same thing that I\u2019m doing now. \n\nMaybe this won\u2019t be the case in a few years from now, but at this moment - I just get so much enjoyment from being able to make youtube videos, express my thoughts, get creative with ideas, and hopefully share my insight with everyone watching. That, to me, is basically just like having fun all day\u2026and there\u2019s no reason to ever leave something I just enjoy so much.\n\nThat, to me, is what early retirement is all about - it\u2019s not about quitting a job you hate, or thinking it\u2019s going to be the end all be all\u2026if anything, it\u2019s really just the beginning to a more rewarding lifestyle where YOU dictate the terms and you decide what you want to work on.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-07-01T22:30:00Z","tags":["investing","investing for beginners","investing in real estate","investing in stocks","real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","real estate investing 101","how to make passive income","passive income 101","passive income ideas","passive income explained","passive income online","retire early","financial independence","personal finance","how to save money","how to save money fast","why i wont retire","millionaire"],"title":"Why I won\u2019t retire","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7pL88MIpKeA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7pL88MIpKeA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7pL88MIpKeA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7pL88MIpKeA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7pL88MIpKeA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M42S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1856","dislikeCount":"168","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"10672","viewCount":"153810"}},{"id":"2TTX43x5ZJ4","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about the worst financial mistakes that I\u2019ve made, the lesson I\u2019ve learned, and how you can avoid making the same mistakes I\u2019ve made\u2026enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFirst: Day Trading Penny Stocks As A Teenager\nHere\u2019s what I learned: Don\u2019t invest in anything you don\u2019t fully understand, do NOT invest in volatile Penny Stocks, and NEVER follow someone else\u2019s advice blindly on the internet. Investing takes time and patience\u2026and you CANNOT rush things because you\u2019re overly excited about making money.\n\nSecond: Working your way up\nHere\u2019s what I learned: If there\u2019s something you want to do, just go right for it - don\u2019t waste your time and energy trying to \u201cprove\u201d yourself, thinking that eventually you\u2019ll get there if you work hard enough\u2026just skip that, and start doing what you want. \n\nThird: Go have fun \nIf anything, I made more money by hanging out with friends because some of those friends either used me to buy or sell a home, or they referred me more business\u2026so if you\u2019re in a similar position, go out and enjoy yourself. It\u2019s not a big deal. \n\nFourth: Working with too many people\nLearn to be selective with your time, and don\u2019t work with everyone for too long. At a certain point, the ONLY way to continue making more money is to focus only on the bigger picture - and get rid of anything else that stands in your way, or takes up too much of your time. \n\nFifth: Being too comfortable\nIf you find yourself feeling bored, unchallenged, and dis-satisfied with where you are right now, CHANGE THINGS. Your mind CONSTANTLY needs new stimuli, you need to constantly be moving forward in order to be fulfilled and grow as a person.\n\nSixth: Timing the market\nIt\u2019s better to find a good deal and buy it, then it is trying to time the markets perfectly at their top and low. Buy with the intention of holding long term.\n\nSeventh: Not understanding taxes\nI highly recommend EVERYONE watching, who has any type of self employed business income\u2026or even any type of income over $100,000\u2026hire someone REALLY good to do your taxes. \n\nEighth: Not getting a credit card\nHad I just opened a credit card at 18 and had a decent credit score by 21, I could\u2019ve easily doubled the real estate I bought back in 2011\u2026and that would\u2019ve been HUGE for me now, almost 10 years later. So don\u2019t make that mistake like I did\u2026if you\u2019re watching this, over the age of 16 years old, and you don\u2019t have a credit card\u2026get a credit card. Thank me later.\n\nAnd those are my worst financial mistakes that I have made so far, and what I\u2019ve learned from them going forward. Like I said, some of them were a little more nuanced than usual\u2026but all of them were so important in helping me get here today. And if you can take a shortcut by AVOIDING the same mistakes that I made, then at least they weren\u2019t made in vain. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-30T22:30:00Z","tags":["worst financial mistakes","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to save money on low income","how to budget","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","passive income","passive income ideas","investing advice","real estate for beginners","robinhood app"],"title":"My Worst Financial Mistakes","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2TTX43x5ZJ4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2TTX43x5ZJ4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2TTX43x5ZJ4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2TTX43x5ZJ4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2TTX43x5ZJ4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1833","dislikeCount":"275","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19828","viewCount":"422431"}},{"id":"8KJkTG0D3ag","snippet":{"description":"Touring a $44 Million Dollar Custom Built Mansion in the Hollywood Hills with Jason Oppenheim - enjoy!

How much is your down payment worth to you, if you just invested it, instead? Having money tied up in a home means less money you can invest ELSEWHERE, at a potentially higher return\u2026\n\nSecond, you shouldn\u2019t buy a home if you\u2019ve only budgeted for your mortgage payment. \nFirst of all, you have property taxes\u2026this varies throughout the United States, but it can range anywhere as low as 0.18% annually in Louisiana\u2026 all the way to nearly 2% annually in New Jersey. \n\nSecondly, you\u2019ll have insurance charges \u2026You\u2019ll usually need, at minimum, home owners insurance that covers your property against certain risks. And then, depending on where the property is located, OTHER insurances could be required - like flood insurance, fire insurance, or earthquake insurance\u2026\n\nThird\u2026your extra payments don\u2019t just stop there, because as a home owner, you\u2019re going to be responsible for all the repairs and maintenance that were previously taken care of by the landlord. \nThis could be as minor as paying for utilities that your landlord would previously pay for, like maybe your water bill, or paying for the gardener to come every other week\u2026.all the way to replacing a roof, a water heater, a cracked  waterpipe, repairing a broken air conditioner, the list goes on. \n\nFourth, buying and selling real estate comes with a VERY large transaction cost. \nFirst, when you\u2019re buying - you\u2019ll have to pay for home inspections, escrow charges, title fees, and loan origination charges - not to mention a whole bunch of other miscellaneous things that come up during the process. Between all of this, you could easily expect to pay 1-2.5% of the homes value upfront when you buy a property.  In addition to that, the transaction costs are MUCH higher when you sell - this is because there\u2019s often real estate agent commissions involved, transfer taxes, escrow charges, more title fees, and more random crap that continually adds up. When everything is said and done, selling a home can easily cost you another 4-6% of the homes value by the time you\u2019re done. \n\nAnd fifth, when buying a home - unless you\u2019re doing it specifically as a long term investment, chances are, you won\u2019t be gaining a lot of equity within the first few years.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, if you buy the right place at the right time and sell after a few years, there\u2019s the possibility of making a decent amount of money while also getting a place to live for free. But assuming the market DOESN\u2019T go up, or stays relatively flat - and if you decide to sell after a few years - chances are, that\u2019s going to cost you more than you would\u2019ve just spent renting instead. \n\nAnd all of that really comes down to determining the true cost of ownership for everything you don\u2019t initially think about, and then running the numbers to determine which is better for your own situation. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-26T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to buy a home","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest as a teenager","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","rich vs poor","rent vs buy a home","rent vs buy","lease vs buy","real estate investing 101","investing for beginners","stock market investing","investing 101"],"title":"Why you SHOULDN'T buy a home","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lrVnO9ja07o\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lrVnO9ja07o\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lrVnO9ja07o\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lrVnO9ja07o\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lrVnO9ja07o\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M47S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1482","dislikeCount":"538","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16468","viewCount":"304440"}},{"id":"sd9w8Zc-QrU","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about Robert Kiyosaki, and why you\u2019re likely seeing so many of his Rich Dad Poor Dad videos showing up lately - Enjoy!

The fact that he was able to articulate such a complex topic in a way that children and young adults would be able to comprehend and internalize, was VERY impressive - and for that, I\u2019m grateful. \n\nAnd when he says our school system has failed our entire generation - I think he\u2019s RIGHT! Not only is the cost of education way too expensive, but schools don\u2019t teach financial education, they don\u2019t teach you how to save on your taxes, they don\u2019t teach you to think objectively and find your own answers\u2026if anything, I believe schools are too structured, to a fault. \n\nBy keeping your focus within such a narrow confine, and by guiding you throughout the memorization of useless test answers, they teach you to follow someone else\u2019s instruction rather than make your own independent decisions. So it\u2019s no wonder why we have people who can\u2019t operate without being told what to do, when to do it, and how to get it done. Hence, they train people to become \u201cemployees.\u201d\n\nBut despite that, for anyone who\u2019s suddenly started seeing his videos come out from the YouTube algorithm - it seems, to me, like a push towards his book promotion.\n\nWhich, I\u2019ll admit - is an effective way to market, so I can\u2019t blame him for doing what works. But overall, from all of this, my thoughts on Robert Kiyosaki haven\u2019t changed\u2026I think he\u2019s got some GREAT general principles and life advice that\u2019s perfect for someone who just needs a kick in the pants to change their mindset, and get them THINKING about entrepreneurship. But beyond the simple basics\u2026I just don\u2019t see it. I\u2019d like to see some more practical, step by step, actionable advice rather than vaguely broad concepts - and I suppose that\u2019s where the disconnect stems from. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-23T22:30:01Z","tags":["robert kiyosaki","rich dad poor dad","robert kiyosaki real estate investing","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing 101","real estate investing with no money","how to invest","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","investing in your 20s","investing for teens","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","how to make 100 per day","how to make money online"],"title":"My thoughts on Robert Kiyosaki","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sd9w8Zc-QrU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sd9w8Zc-QrU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sd9w8Zc-QrU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sd9w8Zc-QrU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/sd9w8Zc-QrU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M10S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"7942","dislikeCount":"5521","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"61498","viewCount":"1367465"}},{"id":"EBrQPo-FS4A","snippet":{"description":"Ever wondered how the super rich invest their money?

And from that, they\u2019ve decided to shift their focus towards one investment in particular: REAL ESTATE\n\nThat\u2019s right, my favorite subject in the entire world besides my own 20-cent iced coffee\u2026REAL ESTATE, which now accounts for 28% of its portfolio allocation. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/11\/15\/wealthiest-people-are-investing-in-real-estate-private-equity.html\n\nAnd Tiger 21 isn\u2019t the only investment group who agrees\u2026we\u2019re seeing a strong surge in real estate ETFs and Investment Trusts, which have led the markets recently among all of the asset classes. \nhttps:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4284762-u-s-real-estate-investment-trusts-led-markets-second-week\n\nPlus, Real Estate Investment Trusts going up in price aren\u2019t the only sign that people are beginning to pay closer attention to real estate\u2026because a recent survey from BankRate shows that 1 in 3 Americans believe that Real Estate is the BEST place to put your money over the next 10 years\u2026and real estate won by a significant margin over stocks, cash, bonds, and gold. \nhttps:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/financial-security-july-2019\/\n\nI believe much of this comes really down to three simple words: Low Interest Rates. \n\nLow Interest Rate are like a fertilizer for real estate prices\u2026and it\u2019s also like the catnip for real estate investors, because they KNOW that low interest rates usually translate into LOTS OF PROFIT. \n\nSince the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates, it just made Real Estate a LOT more affordable for buyers\u2026this means that buyers can pay MORE for a property, potentially increasing demand and further driving up prices. \n\nBut that\u2019s not the ONLY reason the ultra-rich are bullish on real estate right now\u2026because there\u2019s another, more subtle reason that not as many people are discussing: That\u2019s INFLATION. \n\nReal estate prices generally BENEFIT from inflation - because overall, throughout our history, real estate prices have increased in value, in conjunction with inflation. So, for example, if we see 2% inflation next year, one might expect to see real estate values increase at a similar rate. \nhttps:\/\/i0.wp.com\/inflationdata.com\/articles\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Inflation-Adj-Housing-Prices.jpg?ssl=1\n\nSo given this information, given the record low interest rates, and given the external pressure to KEEP interest rates low\u2026one can start to see why real estate is slowly becoming a safe haven investment for so many people, including myself. \n\nBut as always, this video is only for entertainment and informational purposes\u2026and isn\u2019t investment advice! \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-21T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest money","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to build wealth fast","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to buy a rental property","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income for beginners","passive income 101","investing for beginners","how to make money online","roth ira","robinhood app"],"title":"The #1 Investment of 2019","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBrQPo-FS4A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBrQPo-FS4A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBrQPo-FS4A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBrQPo-FS4A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EBrQPo-FS4A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1272","dislikeCount":"177","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11506","viewCount":"206833"}},{"id":"Ixf_M_7pMUM","snippet":{"description":"Lets go over how much I spend on dating, and cover some of the best frugal date ideas that you can do to save money - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nSecond Channel http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/TheGrahamStephanShow\/\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFirst, we\u2019ll start with the cheapest date idea out there: The Free Event\nEvery single location out there has free events several times a week that you can just show up to. In Los Angeles, they have free concerts on the Pier. They have art walks. They have free museum days. They have free carnivals. They have food truck meet ups. The options here are literally never ending.\n\nSecond: Go to a cafe and people watch $\nYes, this means actually going and spending money on coffee\u2026which I cringe at a little bit because I HATE spending money on coffee\u2026but lets be real, when you calculate the cost per hour in terms of experience, doing this is really inexpensive. \n\nThird, a personal favorite date idea of mine is to skip the dinner, skip the drinks, and literally just go straight for dessert. \nHere\u2019s my thinking: on a first date, it\u2019s JUST about getting to know the other person\u2026and going all out for dinner and drinks is an expensive way to find out if it\u2019s a good match. So instead, just go straight for dessert\u2026first of all, it\u2019s a fun unique idea. Second of all, everyone loves dessert. Third, it can be a memorable, fun experience. And fourth, it\u2019s way cheaper than dinner. \n\nFourth, if you want to go for the typical dinner date - you can still do that, on a budget, by going to one of those really good hole-in-the-wall-spots.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: those hole in the wall spaces are usually REALLY REALLY good, there\u2019s usually a REALLY cool story behind how you found that spot in the first place\u2026and, obviously, they\u2019re typically inexpensive. \n\nAnd finally, if you ARE going to go all out with a dinner and drinks\u2026at least do me a favor and do it on a budget, and that would be on a happy hour. \n\nOngoing Date Ideas:\n\nGo for a hike! \nYou have some great conversation, you get some exercise, and you enjoy each others company. The cost for that is $0\n\nJUST COOK FOOD AT HOME! \nPlus, it\u2019s fun just to cook food with someone else\u2026it becomes much more like a fun experience than it does just a routine of sitting down and eating dinner at some restaurant. And it\u2019s also more personal and enjoyable because you cooked it yourself.\n\nBuild something from IKEA. \nIdeally, this should cost you NOTHING extra because you\u2019d just be buying normal stuff from IKEA anyway\u2026and, if anything, now you SAVE money because you can enlist the help of your significant other to help you build it for free. \n\nAnd fourth, if you want a fun frugal date idea that you can also spin off as being romantic - go for a picnic. \nThis is a perfect blend between going to a restaurant\u2026but also cooking at home\u2026for the price of cooking at home. Plus, picnics are fun and it doesn\u2019t seem like people ever do them anymore. \n\nAnd finally, if you\u2019re going to go out to a restaurant and want that whole experience\u2026you might want to look into splitting a meal. \nJUST MAKE SURE, if you do this, that both of you can agree on what to get - and make sure you have a similar taste in foods. \n\nAnd beyond that, anything else you could do for \u201cdates\u201d is pretty much just up your imagination\u2026go check out some car shows for free, pick a really good show on Netflix to binge watch, go make fun of crazy threads on Reddit, go check out antique shops or farmers markets\u2026you don\u2019t need to absolutely shun spending money, but you can still have such amazing experiences without totally making yourself go broke!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-19T22:30:00Z","tags":["how much i spend on dating","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to save money on low income","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","stock market investing","investing for beginners","frugal dating tips","dating ideas","investing 101","how to make passive income","how to save more money","passive income ideas"],"title":"How much I spend on dating","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ixf_M_7pMUM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ixf_M_7pMUM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ixf_M_7pMUM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ixf_M_7pMUM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ixf_M_7pMUM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2278","dislikeCount":"326","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12395","viewCount":"287766"}},{"id":"GH8tprSoFpc","snippet":{"description":"Go to http:\/\/audible.com\/grahamstephan or text \u2018grahamstephan\u2019 to 500 500 to get one free audiobook, 2 free Audible originals & a 30 day free trial!

Almost every self-made millionaire is like this\u2026unless they\u2019re retired doing whatever, they\u2019re treating their time exactly as if it\u2019s money. By thinking this way, they can make decisions they know will be the best for the long term\u2026and helps not waste time. I really challenge you to begin practicing this daily habit, too\u2026calculate how much your time is worth during your \u201cprime\u201d hours\u2026and do your best to make the best use of that time!\n\nFOURTH: Make a to-do list the night before\nAnd when doing this, make sure your to-do list is actionable and specific, so you can hold yourself accountable to getting it done. And there\u2019s a term for doing this, called the SMART goal:\n\nSpecific\nMeasurable\nAchievable\nRealistic\nTime based\n\nWhen you apply ALL of this to your list making, and prepare this AHEAD of time, you\u2019ll find yourself WILDLY more productive during the day - and you\u2019ll just find a way to get more done. And think of it this way: the sooner you get things done, the more time you\u2019ll have to do other things!\n\nFIFTH: BUDGET\nThe entire point of budgeting is just to make sure you optimize your saving, and make sure you actually have enough money left over to invest and have the money make you more money. This is one of those things that, even if you\u2019re a millionaire, you want to make sure you STAY a millionaire! \n\nIt\u2019s also equally as important that, anytime you make MORE money in your career\u2026that you keep your budget THE EXACT SAME AND SAVE THE DIFFERENCE. \n\nSIXTH: IT\u2019S LONG TERM\nThey don\u2019t expect immediate results, but they can see the long term benefits of putting in the work now. So focus every day on your end game - and make it VERY clear exactly what you want. If you don\u2019t know what that is\u2026how do you expect to get there? So spend time, each and every day, just being clear on what you want and why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out, but you should know the direction you want to go, and roughly where you want to be in the future. \n\nFor business inquiries ONLY, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-16T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to invest in your 20s","investing for beginners","investing in your 20s","how to become a millionaire","habits of millionaires","my morning routine","self made millionaire","how to make passive income","how to make money online","passive income","passive income for beginners","money tips"],"title":"The 6 Millionaire Habits To Make More Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GH8tprSoFpc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GH8tprSoFpc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GH8tprSoFpc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GH8tprSoFpc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GH8tprSoFpc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M22S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1235","dislikeCount":"208","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"14585","viewCount":"243475"}},{"id":"Gu7-vlVFUnw","snippet":{"description":"Stock Market Investing has been rather volatile lately - here\u2019s how you can invest in 2019, in such a way to be profitable long term, according to data - enjoy!

But the surprising result was that the SECOND investor, who just invested the $2000 immediately, had a total investment return of $81,560 - that\u2019s only $5300 LESS than the investor who had literally PERFECT timing, every single year, over 20 years. \nhttps:\/\/www.schwab.com\/resource-center\/insights\/content\/does-market-timing-work\n\nBrad Barber and Terrence Odean analyzed over 66,000 households from 1991 and 1996, and found that the investors who trade the most often earned an annual return of 11.4%\u2026which sounds decent, until you see that the overall market returned 17.9% during that same time period. \nhttps:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/0022-1082.00226\nhttps:\/\/faculty.haas.berkeley.edu\/odean\/Papers%20current%20versions\/behavior%20of%20individual%20investors.pdf\n\nIf you look at the DOWS WORST 20 day performances, you\u2019ll notice that majority of the the best single-day point increases tend to occur within roughly two weeks of its worst single-day declines.\u00a0\nhttps:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2018\/03\/28\/this-is-precisely-why-timing-the-market-isnt-worth.aspx\n\nThis means that if you just happen to sell off your investment to wait until the market drops, you might just miss some of the most profitable trading days afterwards. \nhttps:\/\/www.putnam.com\/literature\/pdf\/II508-ac37f7ad02b2d8889f7e5361f0e8ac86.pdf\n\nSo with all of this data in mind, here\u2019s how you can beat the stock market in 2019 - regardless of what happens: \n\nDON\u2019T TRY TO TIME THE MARKET AND DON\u2019T SELL WHEN THINGS DROP IN PRICE. \n\nInstead, the ONLY method which is HISTORICALLY PROVEN TO ACTUALLY WORK OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS - is just to invest as soon as you have the money, hold that investment over 20 years or longer, and do absolutely nothing when it goes down in value. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s how simple investing really is.\n\nThere is ALWAYS going to be \u201csomething\u201d that could impact stock market returns, but whether or not we see a negative yield that year is nearly unpredictable. This continues throughout the last 100 years\u2026so us in 2019 is nothing new, the context might be different but the results will very much be in line with history:\nhttps:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=wAblMinB3UMC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=stock+market+performance+watergate+cuban+missile&source=bl&ots=lXZmz3h8HB&sig=ACfU3U3VBwAdXbACZVpE23FKsbV58xBNyg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNrY3lxP7jAhWKLHwKHbhAD2U4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nLow prices are a time for HUGE opportunity\u2026we should just see this as a part of a normal market cycle, and continue forward with business as usual\u2026and most importantly, just buy and hold long term.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nSecond Channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCa-ckhlKL98F8YXKQ-BALiw\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\n\nFIRST: GET A CREDIT CARD\nDoing this is VERY easy - as a first credit card, I highly recommend The Discover It Secured Card. \nAll you need to do is put down a small deposit, and they will give you a credit card with a limit equal to that amount. To build your credit, all you need to do is put a minimal amount on the credit card each month, then pay it off in full to avoid paying any interest. It\u2019s as simple as that, the entire process should take you less than 15 minutes to do.\n\nSECOND: GET A BANK ACCOUNT\nI think it\u2019s incredibly important that you have a bank account that\u2019s solely in your own name, that ONLY you have access to - this is just one step closer to becoming a productive, financially responsible adult. Again, this step is just about learning how to manage money on your own, and eventually becoming an independent adult who can support themselves financially\u2026and smash the like button.\n\nTHIRD: GET A ROTH IRA\nA Roth IRA is a tax advantaged retirement account that lets you contribute post tax money\u2026meaning taxes have already been taking out of what you earned\u2026and by the time you\u2019re 59.5, all the PROFIT in that account can be accessed completely tax free. \n\nFOURTH: STAY OUT OF CONSUMER DEBT\n I\u2019m not referring to a low interest rate mortgage on a rental property, or any type of leverage that makes you more money\u2026instead, I\u2019m referring to credit card debt, expensive personal loans, high interest auto loans, or ANY other type of loan that serves no purpose other than to make your life awful. The responsible way to handle purchases is to only buy things that you can afford, put it in a credit card\u2026and then PAY THE CREDIT CARD OFF IN FULL before its due. \n\nFIFTH: GET A JOB\nI sound like some old man saying this, but no joke, if there\u2019s ANYTHING that set me up for a successful future, and that got me started on the right path early in life\u2026it was this. GET A JOB. Anything. Even if it\u2019s a few hours per week, JUST GET SOME WORK EXPERIENCE. Doesn\u2019t matter how much money you make, just work\u2026the experience that you\u2019ll get from a part time job will be worth it 100x over by the time you\u2019re older.\n\nSIXTH: LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS\nDo not buy stupid stuff to impress people who don\u2019t matter. Do not waste your money on things that aren\u2019t going to benefit you long term. I\u2019m a firm believer that it\u2019s totally okay and acceptable to live SUPER cheaply in your 20\u2019s, to set up the rest of your life to live comfortably.\n\nSEVENTH: DONT GO TO COLLEGE JUST TO GO TO COLLEGE\nHere\u2019s my solution: if you don\u2019t know what you want to do with your life, either go and get work experience until you figure it out - or go to a 2-year community college part time while you work. This way, you can save a TON of money - you can continue working at the same time - and that gives you more time to figure out what you really want to do. \n\nEIGHTH: INVESTING ADVICE FOR TEENAGERS:\nFor most people out there, just invest in a broad low-cost index fund, invest consistently, and invest with the expectation of holding it for the next 30-40 years. That\u2019s literally it. An index fund like FZROX, VTSAX, FIAX, or a target date retirement fund through Vanguard would do the trick. If you just do this one investment, chances are, this will become you full retirement when you\u2019re older. \n\nNow, If you ARE going to take on more risk, while you\u2019re young is the time to do it. If you want to start that business, DO IT. If you\u2019re successful at it, then you\u2019re further ahead financially. Either way, you win\u2026even if you LOSE, it\u2019s better you lose a small amount when you\u2019re 18, then a LARGE amount when you\u2019re 35.\n\nSo don\u2019t let those mistakes be made in vain\u2026if everyone can learn from what I did wrong, then at least my mistakes went to a good purpose.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-09T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest as a teen","what to do when you turn 18","how to invest as a teenager","investing for teenager","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest 1000","how to invest 10000","stock market investing","real estate investing","credit cards","credit score explained","how to build your credit score","how to save money","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"The Millionaire Investing Advice For Teenagers","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EKIhc3tS0os\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EKIhc3tS0os\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EKIhc3tS0os\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EKIhc3tS0os\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/EKIhc3tS0os\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT18M54S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"7456","dislikeCount":"1436","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"131138","viewCount":"1850084"}},{"id":"qEXXkkQDfCo","snippet":{"description":"We\u2019ve all heard the saying: The Rich Get Richer.

This is the Central Bank of the United States, and their job is to control the quantity of money flowing into the economy. \n\nHaving low interest rates CAN stimulate the economy, but generally at the expense of devaluing wages and raising the cost of living. This isn\u2019t always a BAD thing, but what often ends of happening is that the FIRST people to borrow money are often the ones who are credit-worthy, who have money to begin with. \n\nWealthy people are often the first to borrow money at pre-inflated prices, and as they continue to use and invest with cheap money, they slowly start to drive up prices. By the time everyone else can begin investing, prices have already gone up, leaving them without as much room for profit as the early investors. Hence, the rich get richer. \n\nHere\u2019s what this means for you, and how you can benefit from it:\n\nFirst, understand that your CREDIT SCORE IS EVERYTHING. \nIf you\u2019re not already working to improve your credit score, do this RIGHT NOW - get a credit card, pay it off in full, on time, every single month - and get it to the point where you can take advantage of low interest rates to profit from. If you\u2019re confused about how to build your credit, I have a video less than 20 minutes long that I will link to in the description - watch that, and it\u2019ll tell you exactly how to build your credit score. \n\nSecond, SAVE YOUR MONEY. \nIt makes NO difference how much money you\u2019re making, if you can\u2019t save a significant portion of that to invest when you see an opportunity. Even when the stock market plummets in price\u2026if you SAVE your money, you\u2019ll have the gas to put in that Ferrari to go faster than ANYONE ELSE. \n\nThird, INVEST YOUR MONEY\nIf there\u2019s ANYTHING rich people are good at, it\u2019s INVESTING their money\u2026and it\u2019s INVESTING their money at a time where most people can\u2019t or won\u2019t. These are also the people who invest LONG TERM, and aren\u2019t phased by a drop in prices\u2026rich people don\u2019t panic sell out of fear of losing money, instead, they\u2019ll often double down because their investment just went on sale, and now is an opportunity to invest even more money. \n\nFourth, THINK LONG TERM. \nThe BIGGEST mistake you could possibly make is to get emotional about a stock purchase, panic, and sell as soon as it goes down\u2026if there\u2019s anything wealthy investors are good at, it\u2019s buying  an investment with the expectation of holding it long term.\n\nBy holding long term, this also means you\u2019re less likely to sell at a loss, at a time where maybe you shouldn\u2019t be selling\u2026and many studies have shown that time in the market, not timing the market, has led to the greatest chance of success. \n\nSo, yes - to answer the title of this video, the rich have a MUCH easier time getting richer\u2026but once you begin leveraging your money to do all the heavy lifting for you, recessions and low interest rates turn into a sale of just about everything. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-07T22:30:02Z","tags":["how the rich get richer","why the rich get richer","how to be rich","how to get rich","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","passive income"],"title":"How the Rich get Richer","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qEXXkkQDfCo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qEXXkkQDfCo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qEXXkkQDfCo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qEXXkkQDfCo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qEXXkkQDfCo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M26S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1387","dislikeCount":"212","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12970","viewCount":"169743"}},{"id":"S9x1FoosIDo","snippet":{"description":"Here is exactly how you can pay off debt fast, and how to save money as easily as possible - Enjoy!

The first is Mint.com\n2. My second recommendation that I\u2019ve used is PersonalCapital.com\n3. And third, you could also use a software called YouNeedABudget\n\nThe whole point of this is just to be aware of where your money is going, and from that, you can better figure out how to put best use to where it\u2019s going.\n\nTHIRD: Make a NEED TO SPEND vs WANT TO SPEND LIST\n\nYour \u201cNEED TO SPEND\u201d list might be the bare minimum food budget, your housing payment, your insurance payment, or anything else that\u2019s absolutely ESSENTIAL. \n\nThen, the other expense column will be your WANT TO SPEND\u2026this could be anything else. \n\nFOURTH: You need to REMOVE EVERYTHING you possibly can from your \u201cWANT TO SPEND\u201d category. \nI also recommend, when doing this, that you consider SELLING some of the things you don\u2019t need, or are costing you a ridiculous amount of money. \n\nFIFTH: Look into debt consolidation\nIn addition to this, you could also look into getting a 0% interest credit card - and transferring the credit card balance to THAT card to save on the interest. \n\nSIX: PAY OFF DEBT\nThe first method is called the SNOWBALL METHOD, popularized by the one and only\u2026DAVE RAMSEY. \nThis method suggests that you pay off your smallest balance first, then slowly work up to your way up to the largest balance until it\u2019s all paid off. \n\nThe next is called the avalanche method. Instead of arranging your debts by total balance, you arrange them from the highest interest rate first, to the lowest interest rate last. This ensures that you\u2019re putting your money towards its best use, which will cost you the LEAST amount of money in the long term if you stick with it. \n\nMy recommendation is to check out the  Vertex calculator\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.vertex42.com\/Calculators\/debt-reduction-calculator.html\n\nSEVENTH: Pick up a side hustle \nSorry to be super obvious here, but if you literally don\u2019t make enough - it doesn\u2019t matter how much you save, you need to make more money.\n\nAnd with all of this, YOU MUST DO ALL OF THIS CONSISTENTLY!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-08-05T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to get out of debt","how to pay off debt","how to pay off debt fast","how to pay off debt with low income","how to budget","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","investing for beginners","how to invest in your 20s","real estate investing","stock market investing","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","dave ramsey","how to save money","how to save money fast"],"title":"The FASTEST Way To Pay Off Debt","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S9x1FoosIDo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S9x1FoosIDo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S9x1FoosIDo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S9x1FoosIDo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S9x1FoosIDo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M39S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4704","dislikeCount":"524","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"28459","viewCount":"489526"}},{"id":"WR6CNOnbhO8","snippet":{"description":"Today we\u2019re touring a Hidden California Mansion - Enjoy!

The most COMMON return for an individual stock, over it\u2019s lifetime\u2026was a loss of 100%. And only 48% of stocks delivered ANY positive returns, whatsoever. \n\nGiven that, over the long term of day trading\u2026your likelihood of losing money is INCREDIBLY high without a SIGNIFICANT amount of diversification\u2026and money\u2026.and lucky timing\u2026to pick those \u201cwinners\u201d\nhttps:\/\/www.kiplinger.com\/article\/investing\/T052-C007-S001-why-most-stocks-are-stinkers-and-what-to-do-about.html\n\n\nSecondly, given that information\u2026it was found that many investors are OVERCONFIDENT about their investment decisions, leading them to trade more aggressively\u2026and lose more money.\n\nA study published in 2017 found that when day traders are successful, many of them disproportionally attribute their success to ability\u2026rather than luck. Which ultimately leads them to making riskier investments, and further contributing to these losing statistics.\n\nThird, your own EMOTION while day trading will likely be the hardest barrier to overcome\u2026\nAnd when investing, we have FOUR main emotions that come to mind:\nHope - Greed - Fear - And Regret\nNeedless to say, oftentimes those 4 emotions will overpower ANY logic when it comes to the exhilarating thrills of making money and investing\u2026\n\nFourth, unless your trading with a LOT of money - you\u2019ll likely WANT to make riskier, profit driven investments to justify the time you spend investing. \nThis might cause people with less money to make RISKIER investments in the pursuit of making 1000% profits\u2026not 30% profits\u2026therefore, increasing their likelihood that they\u2019ll lose money. \n\nAnd fifth, the main reason I believe people lose money by day trading is because they believe it\u2019s a quick, easy way to make money from their computer or phone with very little work. \n\nThese are people who don\u2019t have a plan, they have no idea when they want to enter or exit a stock, hey don\u2019t do their own research, they want to \u201cget rich quick,\u201d and they\u2019ll often jump into trades on a whim because someone recommended it on reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-30T22:30:00Z","tags":["stock market","stock market investing","stock market for beginners","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in stocks for beginners","stock market 101","how to invest in your teens","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","robinhood","robinhood app","how to make money","how to make money online","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to become a millionaire"],"title":"Why 80% Of Day Traders Lose Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g4TrGD2tDek\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g4TrGD2tDek\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g4TrGD2tDek\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g4TrGD2tDek\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/g4TrGD2tDek\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M4S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4025","dislikeCount":"1187","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"34927","viewCount":"582903"}},{"id":"I9wlrADKPBE","snippet":{"description":"These are my BEST financial decisions that I\u2019ve made throughout the last 12 years, and how this has helped me build my net worth - enjoy!

I began working full time right out of high school, I had ZERO debt, I paid for everything outright, and I was able to use those 4 \u201ccollege\u201d years to get MASSIVELY ahead of my peers, not only monetarily, but in terms of work experience. \n\nSECOND: SAVING EVERYTHING I EARNED\nMy entire rationalization was this\u2026I thought that if I could save ALL of my income\u2026.I could increase my net worth and build my wealth faster than the person who\u2019s 20 years older than me, making 4x what I was making, but spending all of it\u2026and I knew that being young, I could afford to spend LESS than someone who was older and had a lot of overheard\u2026It was from building those habits early on that carried forward, and all of that really just became the foundation of where I am today. \n\nTHIRD: INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE\nIt was really those early real estate purchases that ABSOLUTELY changed my entire outlook on not only investing, but being able to see the rewards of diligent hard work. It was such an incredible feeling to look at a house, and know that I\u2019m the owner\u2026that THAT ownership was the result of so many late nights, so much hard work, so much self doubt, and seeing it right in front of me just made it all feel \u201cWorth it.\u201d \n\nBut things REALLY shifted for me, mentally, once I started receiving rent every month. The idea that I could get PAID, every single month\u2026without having to actively work towards that income\u2026was absolutely addicting. It was as though, every single day, I woke up with an extra $20 underneath my pillow\u2026like a real estate tooth fairy. \n\nFOURTH: LIVING IN A DUPLEX\nI came across a REALLY good deal on a duplex that I absolutely LOVED\u2026and the numbers just became too irresistible not to move in\u2026because that duplex would cost me almost NOTHING to live in, meaning I could LIVE THERE FOR FREE. That\u2019s because, after the rent I received from the other unit, the tax write offs associated with owning a property and using the garage as my office, and the equity I was building by paying down the mortgage...it was a total break even. Plus, I\u2019d be able to MAKE MONEY by fixing it up and see the property value increase. So when I saw that opportunity, I decided to take full advantage of it and move in. That was EASILY one of my best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. \n\nFIFTH: AVOIDING LIFESTYLE INFLATION\nThis is what happens when you slowly start to make more money over time, and you slowly start to treat yourself a little more. Maybe you get a slightly nicer car\u2026you start eating out a little more often\u2026but this slowly just becomes your new level of \u201cnormal,\u201d and it slowly starts to add up. \n\nI\u2019ve made a VERY conscious effort on my part to stay away from lifestyle inflation, and only spend whatever money the rental properties generate\u2026this way, my level of spending can continue indefinitely without me having to actively work, and everything ELSE I make - whether it be from YouTube or real estate sales - is re-invested, to make even more passive income. \n\nAnd it\u2019s really from the cumulation of those choices that\u2019s led me to where I am today, and each one of those choices led to the other\u2026without the building block of saving as much money as I could, I don\u2019t think ANY of this would\u2019ve worked out as well as it did. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-27T22:30:01Z","tags":["best financial decisions","best financial advice","best money advice","investing 101","investing for beginners","investing basics","how to invest for teenagers","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate 101","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to save money","how to save money fast","credit score","credit score explained"],"title":"My 5 BEST Financial Decisions","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/I9wlrADKPBE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/I9wlrADKPBE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/I9wlrADKPBE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/I9wlrADKPBE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/I9wlrADKPBE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M45S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"782","dislikeCount":"144","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"11835","viewCount":"217961"}},{"id":"JXRf_re82g4","snippet":{"description":"I bring my dad on the channel to answer questions about my upbringing, childhood, and his advice to everyone watching - Enjoy!

They found that the positive effects of money began diminishing by the time a person begins making about $75,000 per year. \nhttps:\/\/www.princeton.edu\/~deaton\/downloads\/deaton_kahneman_high_income_improves_evaluation_August2010.pdf\n\nIn 2018, Purdue University took a survey sample of more than 1.7 million people throughout 164 countries, and found that the $75,000 figure was ideal for emotional well being, meaning a persons every day level of satisfaction\u2026but $95,000 was ideal for what they call \u201clife evaluation,\u201d which measures how a person thinks and acts on their long term goals and aspirations. \n\nAlthough, here\u2019s where things take a slightly DIFFERENT turn\u2026The Journey of Consumer Psychology found that money DOES buy happiness, if you just know how to properly spend it\u2026and here\u2019s where things get interesting, because according to them, here\u2019s what CAN make you happy:\n\nFirst, spend money on experiences - not things.\nIt was found that the effects of buying material items quickly begin to fade once we get used to them - but experiences are something that our mind continues to look back on, bringing us more positive emotion. \n\nSecondly, spend more WITH people. \nStudies were conducted in which people were given money, and then tracked how they spent it - either on themselves, or with others. The group that spent the money with others reported a much higher level of enjoyment than the group who spent it on themselves. Anything we do to improve our connections with others tends to improve our happiness as well\u2014and that includes spending money. \n\nThird, spend money frequently on SMALL things - rather than infrequently on LARGE things\nOur minds ability to adapt and get used to even the BEST purchases that money can buy is inevitable\u2026so given that, it was found that our minds are less likely to adapt to a variety of smaller purchases - than we are ONE very large one. \n\nFourth, spend LESS money on insurance\nPurchasing extended warranties or other forms of purchase protection was associated with the likelihood that someone would regret their purchase, and that many people view a purchase with their FUTURE REGRET in mind.\n\nFifth, pay for things upfront - enjoy them later\nPeople can derive an INCREDIBLE amount of enjoyment and happiness from ANTICIPATING an event, sometimes even MORE so than the actual event itself.\n\nSixth, think about what you\u2019re NOT thinking about\nIt was found that the farther out an event was to happen, the more fondly we tend to look at It. But as the event gets closer, we begin to think of all the intricacies that were previously overlooked\u2026By more thoroughly thinking through EVERY part of that purchase, a person is more reasonably able to match their expectation with happiness in terms of what they buy. \n\nSeventh, comparison is the thief of joy\nResearch shows that people change their opinions about what they want to purchase, by showing them larger, but LESS DESIRABLE comparisons that they could get, instead.\n\nAnd eighth, follow the heard - not your head\nStudies have found that the best indicator of whether or not WE will enjoy something, is whether or not OTHER people have enjoyed it, as well.\n\nThe good news, is that you don\u2019t need to be a multi-millionaire to be just as happy as one\u2026because they\u2019re no more happier than anyone else. And by seeing the positives in a situation, appreciating what you have, and by spending your money strategically on the things that matter the most - statistically, you\u2019re the most likely to be happy and hit the like button. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-23T22:30:00Z","tags":["can money buy happiness","money happiness","how much money do i need","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in your teens","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to build wealth fast","how to make passive income","passive income 101","credit card","credit card 101","how to increase your credit score","how to be a millionaire","how to be a millionaire in 3 years"],"title":"Money Can Buy You Happiness.

That allows you to profit the difference between what you pay in interest, and what that money makes you. \n\nNow secondly, another HUGELY important reason I invest in real estate\u2026as well as pretty much everyone else out there, ever\u2026is Cashflow. \nThis means that you\u2019ll be getting a consistent amount of money returning to your pocket, each and every month, as your tenants pay you rent. \n\nThird, lets talk about another HUGE benefit of real estate investing\u2026and one of the topics I also dread the most\u2026TAXES\nThankfully, real estate has some AMAZING tax benefits that often means you won\u2019t be paying any taxes at all on the money you make\u2026here\u2019s what I mean:\n\nFirst of all, basically EVERYTHING in real estate is a write off against your rental income\u2026\nFor example, you can write off your mortgage interest as an expense\u2026meaning that\u2019s a tax write off.\nThe property taxes you pay\u2026that\u2019s also a tax write off.\nYour cost to insure the property\u2026that\u2019s also a tax write off. \nAny costs you spend repairing the property\u2026that can also be a tax write off.\n\nIn addition to that, you also have what\u2019s called: DEPRECIATION\n\nThis is a tax-loss strategy where you can depreciate the cost of the property over 27.5 years against your rental income\u2026because, according to the IRS, the property is seen to be \u201closing value\u201d over time as it ages and deteriorates, and you need to be compensated for that. \n\nNow speaking of depreciation\u2026.lets flip it around, and talk about another MAJOR reason I invest in real estate\u2026APPRECIATION. \nOver the long term, your property should go up in value as demand increases, and as inflation causes everything around us to rise in price\u2026including your property\u2026and this means that, one day, it\u2019ll be worth MORE than you bought it for. \n\nNow speaking of all this money and property value talk...and not paying taxes legally talk\u2026.that brings us to one of my FAVORITE reasons to invest in real estate\u2026and that would be the almighty CASH OUT REFINANCE. \n\nIt\u2019s like saying \u201cI have $100 worth of profit I want to use but it\u2019s locked up, and I don\u2019t want to unlock it otherwise I\u2019ll pay taxes. So instead, I\u2019ll borrow $100 from a bank, who then holds on to MY $100 in the event I don\u2019t repay them\u2026now I have $100 to spend, and I\u2019m never taxed on that money.\n\nThen, once you get that new mortgage\u2026the same rules as above apply. The interest is a write off against your income, and it allows you to leverage that money to make even MORE money\u2026viola! Real estate for the win! \n\nThis really only scratches the surface of how people make money doing this\u2026other advantages include being able to buy a property below what it\u2019s worth, being able to fix it up to increase its value and cashflow, not to mention the almighty 1031 exchange that allows to you defer taxes anytime you sell real estate to buy a similar property.\n\nIt\u2019s really because of everything I just mentioned which is why I\u2019ve put so much focus on real estate investing over the last almost 8 years!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-20T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","investing for beginners","investing in real estate","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income in real estate","real estate 101","credit score","how to increase your credit score"],"title":"Why I Own Over $4,000,000 In Real Estate","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LB2t0qtSHbw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LB2t0qtSHbw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LB2t0qtSHbw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LB2t0qtSHbw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LB2t0qtSHbw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M8S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1392","dislikeCount":"135","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13477","viewCount":"144575"}},{"id":"eJXq_2mlYEk","snippet":{"description":"These are my Top 5 All Time Favorite Credit Cards and why I got them - enjoy!

In addition to that, there\u2019s some other advantages that make the card a good deal\u2026for instance, you\u2019ll get $100 per year as an airline credit if you chose to check your bags or purchase in flight meals. You\u2019ll also get purchase protection up to $10,000 per purchase\u2026so if your item is lost, stolen, or damaged in the first few months, they\u2019ll take care of it for you. They\u2019ll also extend your warranty for up to 2 years on eligible products\u2026so if you buy something and it breaks, chances are, American Express would cover it. \n\nMore Info: https:\/\/amex.co\/2kNwIsV\n\nSecond: The American Express Platinum. \nReferral Link: http:\/\/refer.amex.us\/GRAHASN7wu?XLINK=MYCP\nWhen I signed up this card, I got 60,000 points. In addition to that, it gets you into one of my favorite places in the entire world: American Express Centurion Lounge. In addition to that, you\u2019ll also get a $100 Hotel Credit on select hotels\u2026discounts on other hotel services\u2026a $200 airline credit towards the airline of your choice\u2026and then you\u2019ll get top of the line purchase and loss protection.  \n\nNow, yes\u2026this card does come with a $550 per year annual fee. And to be eligible to even get the card, you\u2019ll typically need a strong credit score, combined with a decent income\u2026but provided you\u2019ll actually USE these benefits, it could EASILY pay for the annual fee so many times over.\n\nThird: The Chase Sapphire Reserve\nNow they\u2019ll give you 50,000 points for signing up when you spend $4000 in the first 3 months. And when you redeem those points through chase, they\u2019re worth 50% more\u2026meaning 50,000 points will give you $750 worth of value. \n\nIn addition to that, they\u2019ll also give you a $300 annual travel credit. And best part of all, is that with this card, you get access to their Priority Pass Airport Lounge. However, there is an annual fee of $450 per year. BUT, between the $750 worth of the sign up bonus\u2026the $300 airline credit\u2026and the priority pass lounge access, not to mention a TON of other rewards for the card that are just too much to mention\u2026the $450 just pays for itself very quickly. \n\nFourth: The JP Morgan Reserve Credit Card\nNow not always, but USUALLY to get access to the JP Morgan Private Bank, and to get access to this credit card, you need $10 million in assets\u2026hence, the $10 million dollar credit card. And even though, I admit, this card is almost identical to the Chase Sapphire Reserve in terms of benefits\u2026it does have a few unique advantages, like complimentary United Lounge Access.\n\nFifth: Chase Ink Business Preferred\nTypically you can find 80,000-100,000 point sign up offers. The GREAT thing with this card is that there\u2019s only an annual fee of $95 per year\u2026which, in my opinion, is a small price to pay for $1200+ worth of free travel. \n\nNow as far as overall rewards go\u2026it\u2019s decent. Nothing spectacular, although you can get 3x points on spending on social media advertising and other business expenses\u2026which is nice, but not as nice as some of the other cards I\u2019ve mentioned. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the card links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

At the time, I wasn\u2019t necessarily in the market for a new car\u2026but after going on their website, analyzing the tax benefits, and running the numbers, I quickly came to the conclusion that the car was only going to cost me\u2026out of pocket\u2026$78 per month to own within the first year. \n\nIt was also at that time that I posted the video detailing the financial breakdown, tax deductions, and rebates which brought the car down to the $78 per month, along with my experience buying a Tesla online. And almost immediately\u2026that video just took off. \n\nWithin the first 28 days of posting that video, it gathered over 3 million views\u2026over 20 million minutes of watch time\u2026and from that, $25,000 in revenue. And to my dismay\u2026it didn\u2019t stop there. In total\u2026within the last 5 months\u2026that one single video made about $50,000, enough to pay for the car in its entirety.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, that wasn\u2019t intentional\u2026I never expected that video to do so well, and never thought my channel would EVER generate so many views\u2026most of that just happened by a stroke of luck and a gift from the almighty youtube algorithm Gods\u2026but looking back, in hindsight, buying this Tesla was the single best purchase I have ever made. \n\nAnd overall, I\u2019m pleased to say, I absolutely LOVE the car. \n\nCosmetically, the car needed some improvement\u2026like many of you said, the original aero-wheels weren\u2019t doing the car any favors\u2026so I swapped them out for light weight, flow forged Blaque Diamond Wheels. And instead of paying for the upgraded paint on Tesla\u2019s website, I had my buddy at The Wrap District wrap the car in Satin Black with Gloss Black Trim. \n\nTo accentuate the car a little further, I went ahead and painted the calipers and emblems in Acid Green\u2026so now the car looks \n\nSo overall, I\u2019ve been incredibly happy owning the Tesla Model 3, and can quite literally say this car been the best car I have ever owned. Not only that, but by pure stroke of luck\u2026this car ended up paying for itself within a few months\u2026and bringing an entirely new audience to the channel. \n\nSo for that, I want to thank you - I\u2019ll continue to share every step of this youtube journey, answer the important questions everyone wants to know\u2026like how much I made from that video\u2026and I\u2019ll continue to ask everyone to smash the like button for the youtube algorithm. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-16T22:30:00Z","tags":["tesla","tesla model 3","2019 tesla","model 3","78 tesla","the 78 tesla","tesla graham","how i got a free car","how to save","how to save money","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","stock market investing","stock market investing for beginners","investing 101","passive income","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","how to make money online","how to invest in your 20s"],"title":"How I got a Tesla for Free","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mLScCY2DEJA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mLScCY2DEJA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mLScCY2DEJA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mLScCY2DEJA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mLScCY2DEJA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2297","dislikeCount":"1371","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"34711","viewCount":"594942"}},{"id":"oALFays59tg","snippet":{"description":"These are the worst tenant stories from my experience as a real estate agent and real estate investor, and how to avoid this from happening to you - enjoy!

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nI\u2019m sure a big misconception people have about me is that I\u2019m like this extroverted people-person who shouldn\u2019t have any problem whatsoever socially\u2026and that\u2019s very, very wrong. \n\nIn fact, the person you see today is something I\u2019ve worked YEARS on to cultivate and build up to\u2026because I\u2019m not NATURALLY that outgoing, or social, even though it might seem like that on YouTube. Deep down, I\u2019m pretty reserved, I don\u2019t like being the center of attention, I get nervous in big crowds, I suddenly become hyper aware of everything I\u2019m doing, and I\u2019m very much an introvert.\n\nBut despite that, I\u2019ve really made an effort not to let that get in the way, slow me down, negatively impact my life, and hinder my ability to otherwise put myself out there\u2026so this is my story, how I was able to overcome it, and my advice for anyone else out there who\u2019s maybe feeling similar to myself. \n\nHere are a few really easy strategies that made it INCREDIBLY easy to make new friends:\n\nThe first was straight from the book: how to win friends and influence people, which encouraged you to be inquisitive about the other person - because people LOVE talking about themselves. I loved this strategy, too - because it took all the pressure off of myself, and I could just stand there and let the other person do all of the work. \n\nOr another one was simply just acknowledging the situation for what it is\u2026sometimes I\u2019ll just flat out say \u201cHey, I\u2019m Graham\u2026I don\u2019t know anyone here, I feel super weird about it, but I figured I\u2019d just introduce myself so I\u2019m not that random dude standing in the corner.\u201d BAM. Everyone\u2019s been there, everyone can relate to that, so they\u2019ll immediately just open up to you because you were honest. \n\nI also realized that people REALLY respect you for fully just embracing yourself, almost no matter how you act. As long as you are unapologetically yourself, people LOVE that - because pretty much everyone, deep down, is afraid of being their true selves\u2026so when they see someone else doing it, it makes them feel incredibly comfortable because there is no \u201cfakeness\u201d or \u201cfront\u201d - what you see is what you get. So fully embrace who you are, or any weird things about you - and that\u2019ll work in your favor. \n\nSo if you\u2019ve ever felt the same way, or ever felt stuck like you don\u2019t know what to do - just know, it gets better, but you\u2019re going to have to make an effort to improve things. Start saying YES more often, go to local meet ups to things you\u2019re interested in, try reconnecting with old friends, and start doing that regularly\u2026it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to turn into this crazy social person, but it does mean that you can adapt as needed and not let that get in the way of you becoming your best self. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-11T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to become an extrovert","how to be an extrovert","how to invest","how to invest in your 20s","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to save money on low income","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","passive income","how to become a millionaire","passive income ideas"],"title":"My struggle with social anxiety","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xUfX07b1RHE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xUfX07b1RHE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xUfX07b1RHE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xUfX07b1RHE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xUfX07b1RHE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1841","dislikeCount":"141","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12900","viewCount":"184179"}},{"id":"TPX_OTvGk9k","snippet":{"description":"This is my advice for everyone between the ages of 18 - 35 on how to manage their money, what to save, and how to invest - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\n\nFirst Mistake: Spending too much money \nThat\u2019s why my #1 piece of advice, ESPECIALLY for anyone who\u2019s 18 to 35 years old, is to SPEND LESS THAN YOU MAKE. I know, it might be common sense to you and I\u2026but it\u2019s not to common sense to a LOT of people. Especially when you consider that 40% of Americans couldn\u2019t cover an unexpected $1000 emergency. So the EASIEST way to get out of that trap, is to simply: track your spending and cut back on discretionary expenses. \n\nSecond Mistake: Getting Into Consumer Debt\nI really believe that having ANY amount of unpaid consumer debt will grossly hinder your ability to build wealth in the future. So if at all possible, avoid consumer debt AT ALL COSTS\u2026use it only as a LAST CASE RESORT if you literally won\u2019t have food on the table, or there\u2019s something that happens and there\u2019s just no other option.\n\nThird Mistake: Lifestyle inflation\nThis is the practice in which we make a little bit more money, and then we start spending just a little more each month. The biggest issue I\u2019ve seen is that people get used to spending almost all the money they make, and when that happens\u2026they almost DON\u2019T KNOW what to do when they have money left over at the end of the month\u2026.so then, they just continue spending it. And that\u2019s where the problem lies. \n\nFourth Mistake: No Emergency Fund\nAn emergency fund is the money you set aside to ONLY be used in case of an emergency, where you have no other option to turn. Ideally, the size of this fund should equal anywhere from 3-6 months of your expenses, and kept easily accessible. \n\nFifth Mistake: Being Too Cautious About Credit With No Credit Card\nGetting a credit card, and learning how to handle it responsibly, is so incredibly important to your financial future. Not only will a credit card provide purchase protection, rewards, or cash back throughout all of your purchases - but you\u2019ll be continually improving your credit score, which will get you the best and lowest rates anytime you buy a property, finance a car, rent an apartment, or do ANYTHING that involves running your credit report. \n\nSixth Mistake: Not Contributing To Your Retirement\nFor instance, the BEST time to contribute to a Roth IRA is when you\u2019re young and not earning a ton of money\u2026this is because you\u2019re in a low tax bracket already, so you have more money left over, and your money has more time to grow. Or a 401K allows you to reduce your taxable income and postpone your tax bill until retirement\u2026not to mention that sometimes employers will match your contribution, dollar for dollar, up to a certain amount. \n\nSeventh Tip:\nNow is your time to absolutely pursue your career aspirations, work harder than you ever thought was possible, save every extra dollar you can. While sure, it\u2019s fine every now and then to relax and have fun\u2026stay disciplined, because if you play this right, you could use these your 20\u2019s to accumulate enough investable assets to carry you forward for the rest of your life. \n\nAnd during all of that, do your best to also focus on INCREASING your INCOME, just as EQUALLY as you are on SAVING IT. Sometimes people just can\u2019t save enough money, and it\u2019s not a fault of their savings or spending habits\u2026it\u2019s just the fact that they don\u2019t earn enough in the first place.\n\nAnd when it all comes to investing\u2026just keep it simple. Broad index funds are the easiest, simplest, and \u201csafest\u201d investments out there when held long term. Or, it\u2019s as simple as spending a few hours a day on BiggerPockets and YouTube researching how to invest in real estate - going and checking out open houses on Sundays - and then eventually looking into purchasing some income property once you have your down payment saved up. \n\nInvesting doesn\u2019t need to be complicated, budgeting doesn\u2019t need to be difficult, it\u2019s all about learning the right financial habits early on and then sticking with them long term - and you\u2019ll be on your way to a ton of millennial money. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-09T22:30:00Z","tags":["millionaire financial advice","millennial money","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to increase your credit score","credit score 101","how to get a credit card","passive income","passive income ideas","passive income for beginners"],"title":"Millionaire Financial Advice For 18-35 Year Olds | Millennial Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPX_OTvGk9k\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPX_OTvGk9k\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPX_OTvGk9k\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPX_OTvGk9k\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPX_OTvGk9k\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M49S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1908","dislikeCount":"301","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"29966","viewCount":"499232"}},{"id":"e9L2ThEX1dU","snippet":{"description":"We just hit one million subscribers on youtube - thank you so much!

From the bottom of my heart, to each and every one of you watching this right now. If there\u2019s any take away that I\u2019ve learned over the last few years\u2026it\u2019s just this:\n\nFirst, always be honest\u2026put longevity, integrity, and transparency above EVERYTHING else. \nI chose to focus on making the types of videos that I, myself, would actually want to watch with no hidden agenda\u2026I really wanted to post a video and feel proud of it, knowing that this was the type of information I wish I had access to when I was younger. \n\nSecondly, I chose to share ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING on this channel\u2026\nI\u2019m always completely open about how much money this channel makes, or what I\u2019m investing in and why\u2026but I also really believe that personal finance is so much more than just numbers on a computer screen\u2026.finance indirectly compasses so many other aspects of our lives, from relationships, self confidence, our failures, and all the other life experiences that make you, who you are today. \n\nThird, I really believe we\u2019re all in this together\u2026\nWhatever I learn or figure out along the way, I share. This isn\u2019t just my journey here\u2026it\u2019s all of ours, and we\u2019re all part of it. We, as people, can do so much more with the help of others than we can by ourselves\u2026and that\u2019s been my mindset from the very beginning.\n\nFourth, be appreciative\u2026\nEven though I\u2019ve worked a LOT to post 3 videos per week, for almost 3 years, doing EVERYTHING on my own, while also working full time in real estate\u2026I\u2019m not naive to think that I did this all myself. This is very much a group effort, and I am absolutely and eternally grateful for you. \n\nAnd fifth\u2026I really believe it\u2019s so important just to love what you do. \nI\u2019ve found that people can tell when you\u2019re really passionate and excited about something, and that shows through in the work that you do. Something as small as that makes the BIGGEST difference\u2026and you know the saying: Choose a job you love, and you will\u00a0never\u00a0have to\u00a0work a day in your life. For me, I never saw these videos as a job\u2026.I just had fun getting to nerd out about my interest in credit cards, real estate, and investing..and that was it. \n\nAnd today, all of that has led up to this exact point in time, where we now crossed this one million subscriber milestone\u2026so thank you, so so much.obviously, you are just as much as part of this as I am. \n\nAnd if there\u2019s anything I want to end this video with, it\u2019s this: don\u2019t EVER believe you can\u2019t do something. EVER. I am a perfect example of someone who didn\u2019t believe I had what it took to ever be in this position\u2026\n\nSo if there\u2019s something that you\u2019ve wanted to do, but you don\u2019t feel like you have what it takes\u2026you do. I promise you, just believe me\u2026I am nothing special, but if you want it badly and put your mind to it without giving it\u2026I know you can make it happen. \n\nThanks for watching!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-06T22:30:00Z","tags":["one million","one million subscribers","how to invest","how to invest money","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","index fund investing","investing for beginners","investing in your 20s","investing in real estate","investing 101","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income for beginners","how to make money online","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s"],"title":"i can't believe this happened.","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/e9L2ThEX1dU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/e9L2ThEX1dU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/e9L2ThEX1dU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/e9L2ThEX1dU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/e9L2ThEX1dU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M5S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3117","dislikeCount":"167","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"19628","viewCount":"142367"}},{"id":"AF7LADxBHyg","snippet":{"description":"We first discussed why you shouldn\u2019t buy a home - now lets discuss why you shouldn\u2019t RENT a home. Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nWhy you SHOULDN\u2019T buy a home: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lrVnO9ja07o\n\nFirst, when you own a home - you won\u2019t EVER have a landlord telling you what to do. \nThis alone can be a HUGE motivator for people to buy a home rather than rent\u2026because we\u2019ve all seen some really, really crazy landlords. \n\nSecondly, when you own a home, you can do WHATEVER you want! \nWant the walls to be painted purple? Go ahead and paint them purple. You want to change the tile in the kitchen? Go ahead and do it. You want to smash the like button for the algorithm? Go ahead and do it. \n\nThird, you won\u2019t ever have to worry about a landlord evicting you or asking you to leave. \nIf you want the ultimate stability to know you aren\u2019t going to need to move a year from now, buying is the best insurance you have. \n\nFourth, speaking of that\u2026another HUGE advantage over buying a home is that you won\u2019t have a landlord who\u2019ll raise you rent each year. \nThat, unfortunately, is one of the biggest unknowns when renting - how much will that same place end up costing you next year, the year after that, and the year after that. \n\nFifth, The biggest advantage for MOST people, is that having a mortgage FORCES them to save money\nIn a way, your home is almost like a piggy bank\u2026every month, you\u2019re putting a little money away where it\u2019s safe. \n\nSixth, In addition to forcing you to save, buying a home also means it\u2019ll LIKELY go up in value over the long term\nThis is also what\u2019s known as \u201cappreciation\u201d\u2026meaning, the home \u201cappreciates\u201d in value. \n\nSeventh, Another HUGE benefit\u2026speaking of appreciation\u2026is that when you buy a home, you can LEVERAGE your money. \nThis means that you can own 100% of a property, while only paying a modest down payment - and then borrowing the rest in the form a mortgage. This means you\u2019ll get to keep 100% of those appreciation profits, even though you didn\u2019t put in 100% of your own money.\n\nEighth\u2026depending on how you file your taxes, your mortgage interest and property taxes an be a tax write off! \nNow all of this depends if you take the standard deduction or you itemize\u2026but if you itemize, you can write off the interest you pay up to the first $750,000 of your mortgage. Same goes with property taxes\u2026again, unfortunately, there\u2019s a State and local tax deduction capped at $10,000\u2026but depending on your tax bracket and how much you pay, your property taxes could potentially be another write off - saving your more money. \n\nNinth\u2026in the event you need access to the money within the property, you can get access to it - ENTIRE TAX FREE - by doing that\u2019s called a Cash out Refinance or a HELOC.\nA cash out refinance just means a bank will loan you against the equity that\u2019s already in your house, and you won\u2019t pay any taxes on that money you borrow. N\n\nAnd FINALLY\u2026if you DO decide to sell the home that you\u2019re living in, you won\u2019t need to pay any taxes on the first $250,000-$500,000 worth of profit. \nThat\u2019s thanks to a homeowners exclusion that says, if you live in a home for 2 of the last 5 years, you get to keep the first $250,000 tax free if you\u2019re single, or $500,000 if you\u2019re married\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-09-04T22:30:01Z","tags":["why you shouldn't rent","rent vs buy","rent vs buy a home","real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to buy a house","real estate investing with no money","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","passive income 101","real estate millionaire"],"title":"Why you SHOULDN'T rent a home","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AF7LADxBHyg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AF7LADxBHyg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AF7LADxBHyg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AF7LADxBHyg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/AF7LADxBHyg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M19S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2031","dislikeCount":"501","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"25594","viewCount":"447730"}},{"id":"ocJH1HRR09g","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss the potential of an index fund bubble, whether or not you should worry, and how to invest long term to build wealth - enjoy!

Here\u2019s what I found.\n\nWhen a stock is going to be added to an index, it\u2019s announced AHEAD OF TIME - BEFORE index fund managers can actually go ahead and buy it. This leaves time for individual investors and speculators to buy in, anticipating it being added to the index within the coming week - and trying to make a profit. \n\nWhen it was researched, it was found that stocks DO generally see a rise in price once it\u2019s ANNOUNCED they\u2019re going to be added to an index - but ONCE they\u2019re actually added to the index, the pent up demand slows down - the stock price drops - and then it returns it a new \u201cnormal.\u201d \nhttps:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4009991-index-front-running-happens-stock-added-index\n\nLong term, however, it was found that adding a stock to an index has no permanent effect on the price \nhttps:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/medialibrary\/media\/research\/staff_reports\/sr484.pdf\n\nFirst, to be a part of an index, you actually have to have the merits to be included\u2026you have to be a successful company, have brand recognition, and otherwise have the attributes and market cap to be considered. \n\nSecond, the way index fund investing works, is that the fund is weighted towards the biggest companies that make up the largest volume\u2026this means that only the biggest companies get most of the index investment, since THOSE make up the biggest portion of that \u201cbasket.\u201d This also means the smaller companies receive very little \u201cindex fund\u201d money, because they make up such a small percentage of the overall index.\n\nThird, once a company is added to an index - it must actually PERFORM well, and much of its stock price movement will be from it\u2019s earnings, performance, and ongoing development. Otherwise, if it doesn\u2019t perform well, it\u2019ll get bumped and the price will go down - causing a small percentage of the overall index to go down, with it. \n\nSo, given all of this\u2026no, I personally don\u2019t see there being any signs of an index fund bubble - and none of my research points anything to confirm this is a cause for concern. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026as with anything, at ANY time in the market cycle, I WOULD recommend you always:\n\nHave a 3-6 month emergency fund in cash at all times - in a high interest savings account\n\nInvest money you aren\u2019t planning to touch for at least 10-20 years\n\nDO NOT PANIC SELL anytime something drops in price - just stay the course and continue as normal\n\nALWAYS Diversify your investments - whether it be through index funds, real estate, or bonds \n\nAnd always\u2026no matter what\u2026smash the like button\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-30T22:30:04Z","tags":["index fund","index fund investing","index fund investing for beginners","vanguard index fund","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to invest in your 20s","investing for beginners","robinhood","robinhood app","robinhood app review","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","passive income 101","investing 101","index fund bubble"],"title":"WARNING: The Index Fund Bubble","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ocJH1HRR09g\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ocJH1HRR09g\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ocJH1HRR09g\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ocJH1HRR09g\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ocJH1HRR09g\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2047","dislikeCount":"820","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"33208","viewCount":"550224"}},{"id":"cTj6xdaI8_s","snippet":{"description":"Here is exactly how much I make selling merch, how print on demand works, and my thoughts on building a business to generate passive income - Enjoy!

HOWEVER, the entire point of doing all of this was so I could test out the demand, and try a proof of concept to see if this was something worth pursuing. \n\nIf I were going to go all out with this, and really dedicate my time to selling merch\u2026knowing what I know now, I\u2019d likely pre-order the most popular items in bulk, going with a fulfillment center like 3PL which would manage the supply and inventory - and they\u2019d charge a small fee per order. Doing that would give me much better profit margins in terms of selling merch. \n\nSecondly, to be completely honest\u2026I thought selling merch would be a REALLY easy thing to do. It seems like EVERY YouTuber is doing it, so I just assumed it would be a super viable business right from the start\u2026but, I quickly realized that was wrong. I thought this was something I could just throw in the description and it would sell itself, but nope\u2026in order for sales to go up, I need to be continually mentioning the store and bringing up it\u2019s awareness. \n\nAnd that brings me to my third realization\u2026I\u2019m not a great salesperson, and I don\u2019t feel good constantly pushing something down your throat. Doing something like that doesn\u2019t come naturally to me, but I also realize it\u2019s something I have to do in order for people to actually know about it\u2026and there\u2019s a fine balance between how much I can mention something before it starts getting really annoying. \n\nGiven that, I was faced with a  realization\u2026I don\u2019t want to pitch a product all the time, so when I DO want to mention something, I have to be VERY selective about it\u2026and the fact is, if I\u2019m going to \u201cpitch something,\u201d it\u2019s MUCH better for me to promote my program than it is my merch line - which which is a pretty low ROI, all things considered. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-28T22:30:01Z","tags":["how much i make selling merch","how to sell merch","how much do youtubers make","income sources","my income sources","how i became a millionaire","how to become a millionaire","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make passive income","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to save money","how to save money fast","robinhood","robinhood app","investing 101","Real Estate 101","passive income"],"title":"How Much Money I Make Selling Merch","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cTj6xdaI8_s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cTj6xdaI8_s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cTj6xdaI8_s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cTj6xdaI8_s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cTj6xdaI8_s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M27S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1232","dislikeCount":"131","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"6104","viewCount":"109612"}},{"id":"Vn9ounAgG3w","snippet":{"description":"Here is EXACTLY how you can increase your credit score fast, and get a perfect 800+ score as easily as possible \u2014 for absolutely free.

EVER. In order to get a perfect credit score, you\u2019ll need to pretty much NEVER miss a payment, ever - otherwise that could completely ruin everything. \n\nSECOND: CREDIT UTILIZATION - 30%\nIn order to get yourself a PERFECT score, the credit bureaus want to see that you aren\u2019t maxing out all of your credit cards, and that you\u2019re keeping a relatively LOW balance compared to the overall credit you have available to you. One of the techniques I use to help with this, is just to have a LOT of available credit - all with really high credit limits. \n\nTHIRD: LENGTH OF CREDIT HISTORY - 15%\nThis just means - the longer you\u2019ve had credit for, and the sooner you start - the BETTER. This is one of the reasons I recommend people begin building their credit score as early as they possibly can, even if it means going and getting a credit card THE DAY THEY TURN 18\u2026this will help build the foundation of your entire credit history very early on. \n\nNow, it is important to remind you that this is calculated as the AVERAGE length of your credit history\u2026not the TOTAL length. So my recommendation is to, first, start building your credit as soon as you possible can - and keep those accounts open and in good standing for as long as possible. This will help you build up a solid fortress of longstanding credit history - so that when you DO apply for new lines of credit, it won\u2019t reduce your average account age as much - and it\u2019ll have less of an impact on your score. \n\nFOURTH: TOTAL NUMBER OF CREDIT LINES - 10%\nFirst, the more credit lines you have - the higher your credit limit - which lowers your overall utilization, and helps your score.\n\nSecond, by having MORE credit available to you, you\u2019re able to show even MORE on-time payments - which, again, will help increase your score. \n\nAnd third, having a mix of credit types - like an auto loan, a mortgage, and credit cards, shows lenders that you can appropriately handle multiple types of loans without defaulting on them. \n\nFIFTH: NUMBER OF CREDIT INQUIRIES - 10%\nAnytime you go and apply for credit, it\u2019s reported to the credit bureaus and shows up on your report as a \u201chard inquiry.\u201d This helps lenders keep track of how many times you\u2019re going and asking for credit\u2026and generally speaking, the more often you\u2019re out there asking for credit, the riskier of a borrower you become. \n\nIn addition to that, if you ARE out there getting new credit cards - that also will LOWER your average credit length - which could further drop your score, as well. \n\nBesides that: \nI HIGHLY recommend you check your credit score every few weeks using a free service like CreditKarma or CreditSesame. Both are FANTASTIC resources that update your score every week - and even though they\u2019re not going to be 100% accurate in terms of calculating what your score will be, they\u2019re going to be fairly close and will give you a comprehensive overview of your entire report. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSome of the card links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

With that type of schedule, also comes a VERY inconsistent income\u2026So that type of inconsistency is something, as an entrepreneur or business owner, you HAVE to get used to and accept. And you DO give up a sense of tranquility in terms of just knowing how much you\u2019ll make and having some type of consistent, predictable schedule. \n\nSecondly, given that type of unpredictable schedule, I\u2019ve absolutely had to sacrifice a big portion of my social life in pursuit of my career\u2026\nWhen you\u2019re working for yourself and setting your own hours, there\u2019s never a time you \u201cClock Out\u201d - and there always seems to be a shortage of hours in the day to get everything done that you need to do. There\u2019s always the feeling that you could be doing a LITTLE more to get ahead, and because of that, you usually end up working a LOT more and keeping yourself VERY busy. \n\nThird, one of my biggest personal sacrifices for the sake of \u201cSuccess\u201d - that I\u2019m sure EVERYONE can relate to on some level - was giving up my \u201cFree Time.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m talking about time in the day where you can afford to just do WHATEVER\u2026maybe a night where you browse TV for a few hours  to see what\u2019s on, or putting on a random movie, or just spending an afternoon taking a nap and lounging around. Because when you\u2019re in the midsts of trying to get yourself ahead, doing that becomes a LUXURY.\n\nWhen you start viewing every little thing you do as having an impact on the rest of your life, you start realizing how limited your free time REALLY IS when you\u2019re trying to get ahead - and you treat it like a very limited commodity. \n\nFourth, another big sacrifice that I\u2019ve had to make throughout the last 12 years\u2026is giving up the ability to travel for fun and go on a vacation. \n\nI\u2019ve always wanted to take a few months off and travel the world\u2026but I\u2019ve always been at the point in my career where if I take time off, I\u2019ll lose a LOT of the momentum I\u2019ve spend years building up to. Positively, since I\u2019ve chosen to delay my vacations, I could afford to now travel in much better accommodations than I could\u2019ve 10 years ago\u2026but even now, travel is incredibly difficult to do with my current schedule. \n\nAnd lastly\u2026my 5th sacrifice, which ties well into the fourth\u2026is the delayed gratification of not giving in to immediate wants and desires. \n\nThroughout my entire career, I have constantly delayed gratification, waited to buy things, lived below my means, taken less expensive alternatives, re-invested my money, and given up a LOT of luxuries for the sake of having more money to invest, and a better future ahead of me\u2026those sacrifices weren\u2019t always easy, but looking back, I wouldn\u2019t have changed ANYTHING. Those sacrifices were absolutely worth it to get to where I am today, and I\u2019m extremely happy with how it\u2019s turned out. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the card links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This also competes against OTHER companies which frequently promote fractional investing - like Stash, Betterment, and even Acorns. \n\nMy personal belief is that old school, brick and mortar brokerages have seen their millennial money slowly draining away to popular stock trading apps and services that automate investing without any hefty fees\u2026think, Robinhood, M1 Finance, Betterment, Acorns, and so on.\n\nSo, Charles Schwab is very much thinking LONG TERM\u2026because they KNOW millennials are going to be the next wave of incoming capital, and it\u2019s important to capture them early, and capture them YOUNG. Just consider this:\n\nRight now, there are 618,000 Millionaire Millennials\u2026and according to a Caldwell Banker report, \u201cBy 2030, millennials will hold five times as much wealth as they have today, and are expected to inherit over $68 trillion from their predecessors in the Great Transfer of Wealth.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/10\/17\/heres-where-the-millennial-millionaires-live-around-the-us.html\n\nIn the next decade, Millennials will have some really serious spending power - and Charles Schwab knows this. They understand that, whoever can capture this millennial market FIRST - will likely have a VERY profitable, and longstanding future ahead of them. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think all of this is likely to go:\n\nFirst, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if bigger brokerages - like Charles Schwab - began copying other features of investing apps, as well. \n\nSecondly, I think apps like Robinhood really need to think about starting their own credit card\u2026it\u2019s about time. \n\nThird, most of those stock trading apps need to roll out banking features\u2026lets be real, if you don\u2019t have a bank and a high interest checking account, you\u2019re a nobody ;)\n\nAnd fourth, if Charles Schwab wants to remain competitive\u2026they NEED to be the BEST for EVERYTHING. \n\nThen - lets not forget what all of this is ACTUALLY for, in the first place\u2026BANKING. That\u2019s where all of this is going to end up.

Just look at the numbers\u2026the average price for a private, 4-year college is nearly 3.5x HIGHER than that of a 4-year in state school.\nhttps:\/\/bigfuture.collegeboard.org\/pay-for-college\/college-costs\/college-costs-faqs\n\nBut maybe, at this point you\u2019re thinking\u2026well, if I go to an Ivy League school and pay a little more money\u2026THAT would make a difference, and THAT would be worth it\u2026.and if you think that way\u2026well, statistically speaking\u2026.you\u2019re wrong. \n\nTwo studies were completed in 1999 and again in 2011 which followed the academic pursuits and income of both Ivy League graduates, and non Ivy-League graduates\u2026and their findings were rather surprising.\nhttps:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w7322.pdf\n\nThis finding suggests that it\u2019s the individual attributes among the students that mattered the most, NOT the college they graduated from\u2026and not from the \u201csocial networking capital\u201d of those prestigious schools. So, no\u2026the type of college you go to will not make a difference in how much money you end up making.  \n\nSECOND: ATTEND A 2 YEAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\nPrice wise\u2026the average annual cost of attending community college is just over $3300 per year\u2026that\u2019s pretty much 1\/3rd the cost of attending a 4-year state school, and 1\/10th the cost of attending a private university. That is a MASSIVE savings, right off the bat, for getting those first 2 years completed and out of the way.\n\nTHIRD: SPEND YOUR TIME - NOT YOUR MONEY\nHere\u2019s what I mean\u2026as a college student, chances are, you don\u2019t have an abundance of money\u2026BUT, you do have your time to use, instead\u2026and one could argue that\u2019s the greatest capital of all. \n\nFOURTH: LIVE OFF CAMPUS\nIt was found that from 2017-2018, students spent an average of $10,800 per year for room and board at public 4-year institutions, and that amount jumps to over $12,200 for private, 4 year colleges and universities. \nhttps:\/\/thescholarshipsystem.com\/blog-for-students-families\/what-is-room-and-board-what-will-it-cost-you\/\n\nFor those reasons, if you\u2019re looking to cut down on these costs significantly\u2026it might be worth it, first, to potentially live at home with your family a little longer. Or you could also look into living OFF CAMPUS, which could still be significantly cheaper than living in the dorms or on campus. \n\nFIFTH: TEXBOOK COSTS\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTo start, the college board found that the average cost of textbooks from 2018-2019 was almost $1300\u2026which, is insane.\n\nFirst, try searching google for a free PDF of your book. All you need to do is type in [title of book] filetype:pdf\u00a0and it should bring up any applicable search results for what you\u2019re looking for. \n\nSecondly, if you can\u2019t find it there - try Amazon or Chegg. They\u2019re both amazing resources where you can rent or purchase textbooks at a MUCH cheaper rate than what your college might charge. \n\n\nSIXTH: CREDIT CARD REWARDS\nThis is essentially the practice in which you open up a credit card with a great sign up bonus, meet the minimum spending requirements, you get the points, and then you can repeat this with other credit cards, as well. And while you\u2019re in college, this is generally the perfect time to do this, because the temporary hit to your credit score won\u2019t really matter in the short term - and long term, you\u2019ll be diversifying your credit history and further strengthening your score. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the card links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The overall message of the post was just this: buying \u201cthings,\u201d getting caught in a consumerist lifestyle, and living to impress others is always going to be a losing battle\u2026so instead, we should strive to REDUCE our overhead, REDUCE our extravagances, and get back to the basics of what we all really value the most: FREEDOM. NOT THINGS.\n\nFirst of all, having any type of financial \u201coverhead\u201d just stresses me out. Having a big mortgage payment, or having a big car payment, or having ANYTHING that l need to be financially obligated to makes me feel trapped, and makes me feel as though I\u2019m on a hamster wheel just running to keep it going. \n\nHaving that \u201cType\u201d of stress causes me to resent the work I do, and stifles my own creativity when it comes to pursuing my own passions - it just drains the fun out of it. This is why I\u2019ve always preferred a financially minimalist lifestyle - the less financial responsibility I have, the more freedom I have\u2026then, the more freedom I have, the less stress I have - and the less stress I have, the happier I am to pursue more creative and fulfilling work.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you what all that saved money really brings you: OPTIONS. That\u2019s it. \n\nMoney is NOT for the purpose of flaunting\u2026it\u2019s NOT for the purpose of trying to IMPRESS random strangers. It is NOT for the purpose of measuring your own self worth, or feeling a sense of superiority over someone else\u2026but, it does give you OPTIONS. That is worth more than ANYTHING I could\u2019ve ever imagined. \n\nFor me, that option was not ever needing to work a job I absolutely loathed\u2026I had the option to pursue the work that meant something, to me\u2026it meant I had the option to spend every day doing something that gives me purpose and meaning to my life\u2026and that NEVER would\u2019ve been the case if I had to sacrifice those values in order to work a job I disliked, just to support the cars, and the houses, and the luxuries I never needed in the first place. \n\nThis is really, at its core, the entire culture of the FIRE movement - Financial Independence, Retire Early.  It\u2019s a community and mindset that you don\u2019t need to be 65 to retire, if you keep track of your expenses, save your income, and grow your wealth to the point where you can live off your investments indefinitely. \n\nAnd THAT is really the entire point of the financial independence movement - it\u2019s spending money on things that really add value to your life, and SAVING with the intention of building a lifestyle that supports that. And while financial independence certainly doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it can absolutely be a goal to work towards and one day achieve - because the less money you spend, the faster you can get there. And the more you can smash the like button. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-14T22:30:01Z","tags":["minimalist","minimalism","financial minimalism","financial minimalist","minimalist living","minimalist home tour","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","investing for beginners","stock market investing","how to make passive income","how to make money online","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to invest in your teens"],"title":"Why I'm a Financial Minimalist","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YUm-7AWwARs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YUm-7AWwARs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YUm-7AWwARs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YUm-7AWwARs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YUm-7AWwARs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M56S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"3056","dislikeCount":"680","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"42567","viewCount":"705008"}},{"id":"9ystJn4uiCI","snippet":{"description":"Today, I react to an article saying that Frugal Millennials Are Ruining The Economy - Enjoy!

And\u2026the answer to that is\u2026.YES\u2026and also, a NO.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that our economy DOES benefit from a surplus of spending...the more money that gets spent, the more it circulates throughout our economy, and the more the entire economy can grow. When the spending stops, that\u2019s bad for business\u2026and bad for growth\u2026 \n\nHowever\u2026if people aren\u2019t spending money\u2026it has to go somewhere. And in this case, the more people are saving - generally, speaking - the more money they can INVEST. This money goes back into businesses, which can use it to further innovate and adapt\u2026which, again, winds up back into our economy...improving it on a macro scale. \n\nSo as long as people aren\u2019t just saving all of their money under a mattress\u2026a higher personal savings rate can be BAD for certain business, GOOD for our economy, and GREAT for the individual who\u2019s able to save more - if it means they can invest it.\n\nAnd overall, based on the original article that brought us here in the first place\u2026I think we ARE seeing signs of a cultural shift AWAY from reckless spending, and into an era of more thoughtful, impacting purchases. \n\nMillennials want more value, we want lower prices, we want more flexibility, and we\u2019re willing to consume less - overall - to get it. And even though we\u2019re getting paid less, and our expenses are going up beyond belief\u2026how we chose to spend our remaining money not only says a lot about us, but where society is going in general\u2026which is placing a stronger emphasis on saving money, living below our means, increasing our credit score, being smart with our money, and smashing the like button.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-11T22:30:00Z","tags":["millionaire reacts","how i became a millionaire","how to be a millionaire in 3 years","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","investing in real estate","investing 101","investing in stocks","how to make money","how to make money fast","how to make money online","how to make passive income","millennial investing","passive income","passive income for beginners","passive income 101","how to build wealth"],"title":"Millennials Are Ruining The Economy.","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ystJn4uiCI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ystJn4uiCI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ystJn4uiCI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ystJn4uiCI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ystJn4uiCI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M9S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2046","dislikeCount":"367","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16996","viewCount":"213436"}},{"id":"wc2kqJRm-sQ","snippet":{"description":"Robinhood responds back with a new Cash Management Account - here\u2019s what they offer, and my thoughts whether or not it\u2019s a good deal to invest in - enjoy!

This means you can have one centralized location where you can view your money, even though - technically - it\u2019s split between several partners. \n\nIn this case, Robinhood is partnering with Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Bank of Baroda, and US Bank\u2026.that could potentially give you up to $1,250,000 worth of FDIC insurance, all at a 2.05% interest rate.\n\nNow, besides the 2.05% interest paid on up to $1,250,000\u2026they\u2019ll also give you access to a debit card, linked to your Robinhood account, issued by Sutton Bank. According to Robinhood, they\u2019ll offer access to 75,000 free ATM\u2019s, all without foreign transaction fees, no maintenance fees, and no account minimums\u2026\n\nAll things considered\u2026this seems really good, and I\u2019ve already signed up to join their waitlist because I want some of that 2.05% interest. And if you were wondering how they compared to other brokerages and banks out there\u2026.it\u2019s decent. Not the best, not the worst\u2026 but decent.\n\nFor example, right now - the best return on a bank account comes from Vio Bank, paying 2.42% interest on your money. \nhttps:\/\/www.viobank.com\/savings-2?npclid=EAIaIQobChMI_qzawKyN5QIVmhitBh3S3gm-EAAYASAAEgLPA_D_BwE&utm_source=google&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_qzawKyN5QIVmhitBh3S3gm-EAAYASAAEgLPA_D_BwE\n\nYou also have MySavingsDirect, offering 2.1% interest with absolutely no fees or minimums\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.mysavingsdirect.com\/securebanking\/login.do?_flowExecutionKey=_c2A0A7E10-AC03-D2BB-9E24-2EAAD8C078A0_kAEC0E5EB-9EB2-EC20-C60E-7BFC422D00BD\n\nOr, you have Wealthfront Cash Management which is a 2.07% return - FDIC insured up to $1 million dollars - again, with no fees or minimums:\nhttps:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360022404932-What-is-Wealthfront-s-Cash-Account-\n\nAnd then of course you have other, similar banks like CIT Bank\u2026Citi Bank\u2026\n\nAnd, obviously\u2026then you have Robinhood. \n\nIn my opinion, what they\u2019re offering right now is good - It\u2019s high enough to get your attention, without being UNBELIEVABLY high\u2026and it\u2019s competitive enough against other brokerages offering $0 trades, without being obnoxiously so. And I think this is a REALLY smart move on Robinhoods behalf to do this NOW, at a time where they really need it the most.\n\nI really hope, in the future, that they can continue expanding their banking services - OR - perhaps give some trading incentives to people who open up a cash management account with them. OR - Maybe one day they begin offering low interest rate loans one day. And I REALLY hope they can eventually expand and improve their customer service, which is where I truly feel their overall platform is lacking\u2026\n\nAs for me, I\u2019ve already signed up for their cash management account and I\u2019m like 80,000 on the list - but given all of this information, I\u2019m going to give it a shot and put some money in to see what happens. I tested this out previously with Wealthfront and was incredibly happy with using their service in conjunction with Ally Bank\u2026so, I\u2019ll give Robinhood a shot, too, so I can report back and see how it goes. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-09T19:00:09Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood app","robinhood investing","robinhood cash management","robinhood debit card","robinhood app review","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest for beginners","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","stock market investing","investing for beginners","investing in your 20s","investing in your teens","how to make money online","passive income"],"title":"ROBINHOOD STRIKES BACK - THEIR RESPONSE!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wc2kqJRm-sQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wc2kqJRm-sQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wc2kqJRm-sQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wc2kqJRm-sQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wc2kqJRm-sQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M59S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1406","dislikeCount":"166","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"12188","viewCount":"223853"}},{"id":"l8jl6z8R31o","snippet":{"description":"Here\u2019s my real estate investing strategy that I use to buy my next property, and exactly what I look for to make passive income - enjoy!

First, I can borrow \u201ccheap\u201d money by taking out a fixed 30-year loan at a rate just barely above inflation\n2. Second, I can leverage my money to generate a higher return on my investment\n3. Third, real estate can make for great cashflow\n4. Fourth, I get a LOT of great tax advantages\n5. And fifth, I\u2019m a believer in long term appreciation of property values \n\nSo given all that, it\u2019s pretty much been an unspoken goal of mine to buy a new property every year. And this officially begins my home search\u2026again\u2026since last year. \n\nTo those who believe the market will drop, here are my thoughts - I have NO IDEA what will happen in the short term. But In terms of the people who ARE buying real estate\u2026they\u2019re VERY qualified. They have hefty down payments, they have great credit, they have verifiable income, they have equity in their home, and they\u2019re getting 15-30 year mortgages with the intention of holding it long term. These are very few investors, these are owner users, and they\u2019re not trying to flip the home for a profit in the short term like we saw in 2006 and 2008.\n\nThis TYPE of buyer should add plenty of stability to the real estate market in the event we see a downturn, because these are the people who are unlikely to sell, they aren\u2019t going to take a loss on their home, and they have the finances to continue making their payments until the market rebounds. \n\nI\u2019m also seeing a LOT of wealthy people keeping cash on the sidelines, just WAITING for there to be a drop in prices\u2026so I believe that if we DO see a sudden decline in prices, there\u2019s no shortage of people out there to buy back in, giving us some level of support from things getting \u201ctoo bad.\u201d \n\nHowever, I\u2019m not naive, and I STILL do want to protect myself IN THE EVENT SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN\u2026.and you can only do that by getting a good enough deal where, if the market declines in value, my worst case scenario is just breaking even. \n\nPoint being\u2026.in this market, or ANY market - that is, I\u2019m looking for value. I want something that I believe has a strong likelihood to go up in value, I want something that has some potential to fix it up, and I want something that would also have a strong rental demand. It\u2019s a tall order, but - it\u2019s out there. Somewhere. \n\nNow\u2026in terms of HOW I find deals in this market\u2026I have two strategies:\n\nOne, look every single day and find a property as soon as it comes on the market. Every now and then, you\u2019ll find a listing come up that\u2019s absolutely AWFULLY marketed\u2026I\u2019m talking wrong square footage, terrible pictures, wrong bedroom or bathroom counts, you name it. Sometimes, those properties are also priced under market value because the seller and agent have NO IDEA what they\u2019re doing. If you spot a listing like this, JUMP ON IT ASAP. \n\nSecondly, my other tactic is to look at homes listed on the market a LONG time - because those properties are likely going to be more likely to negotiate. Those deals are AMAZING\u2026go through old listings, make lower offers on homes that have been sitting around for awhile\u2026and at that point, it\u2019s a numbers game. Just go into it with your limit, knowing what it\u2019s worth, knowing the upside the deal has\u2026and stick with it. You NEED to negotiate everything, and if you\u2019re a ready and willing buyer\u2026you have the leverage, as long as you aren\u2019t competing with any other buyers. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-07T22:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","real estate 101","how to invest","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your teens","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to improve your credit score","credit score explained","how to buy real estate","how to make passive income","passive income","passive income online","passive income for beginners"],"title":"My Millionaire Real Estate Investing Strategy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l8jl6z8R31o\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l8jl6z8R31o\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l8jl6z8R31o\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l8jl6z8R31o\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/l8jl6z8R31o\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M9S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"887","dislikeCount":"172","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"14979","viewCount":"196885"}},{"id":"45mw4chbmJk","snippet":{"description":"Charles Schwab recently announced $0 trade commissions, and its impact effectively cancelled Robinhood Investing, M1 Finance, and so many other brokerages - here\u2019s why.

In fact, according to CNBC, commissions only make up 3-4% of its net revenue\u2026so cutting them out entirely might prove to be a HUGE opportunity to attract more customers to its platform\u2026and also, MAKE MORE MONEY. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/10\/01\/charles-schwab-is-eliminating-online-commissions-for-trading-in-us-stocks-and-etfs.html\n\nThis is because, in 2018, Charles Schwab made $763 Million from its trading revenue\u2026which sounds like a lot to give up\u2026until you realize that $5.8 BILLION DOLLARS came from net interest revenue, that grew by 36% over the last year. With that type of growth, interest revenue on cash deposits could GREATLY outweigh the money they\u2019re \u201closing\u201d by offering commission free trades\u2026not to mention the business they can now take from Robinhood, M1 Finance, and many other brokerages.\nhttps:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/316709\/000031670919000008\/schw-12312018x10k.htm\n\nCharles Schwabs effect by lowering fees to $0 didn\u2019t go un-noticed, and had far reaching impact\u2026shortly after announcing it\u2019s $0 commission, TD-Ameritrade stock plummeted over 30%\u2026because, according to SEC filings, 36% of the companies revenue came from commissions and transaction fees\u2026meaning that Schwab\u2019s rate cut would undermine 1\/3rd of it\u2019s competitors revenue.\nhttps:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1173431\/000117343118000125\/amtd_20180930x10k.htm\n\nAnd so, not surprisingly, TD Ameritrade announced - THE NEXT DAY - that they, too, would be lowering their trading commissions to\u2026you guessed it\u2026to $0. \nhttps:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20191001006211\/en\/TD-Ameritrade-Introduces-0-Commissions-Online-Stock\n\nTo me, all of this is just a race to the bottom - each company is under-cutting the other in an effort to get YOUR business, and YOUR money. While Robinhood was certainly a pioneer for $0 stock trades in an easy to use app, they unfortunately lagged when it came to everything else\u2026their customer somewhat sucks, they don\u2019t offer any retirement accounts, you can\u2019t re-invest dividends, you can\u2019t buy fractional shares, and they don\u2019t offer any banking services\u2026this left the door open for OTHER, more established companies to replicate the Robinhood model\u2026do it WAY better\u2026.and then\u2026take over. \n\nI personally believe we\u2019re going to see most other brokerages follow this model and offer $0 trades, as well, until it just becomes the industry standard.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-04T22:30:02Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood app","robinhood investing","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","investing for beginners","investing in your 20s","investing in stocks for beginners","investing in real estate","investing in stocks","investing 101","stock trading app","how to make money","how to make money online","how to make money fast"],"title":"This Just Ruined Robinhood...","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/45mw4chbmJk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/45mw4chbmJk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/45mw4chbmJk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/45mw4chbmJk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/45mw4chbmJk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M30S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1683","dislikeCount":"328","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"18496","viewCount":"318251"}},{"id":"2imfu6jXcm8","snippet":{"description":"Here is exactly how I manage my time to be as productive as possible, while now making over $1 million dollars per year in income - Enjoy!

So don\u2019t tell yourself \u201cyou don\u2019t have the time\u201d - you do, if you really want to. And that will allow you get a LOT more done than you thought was possible. \n\nSECOND: I re-adjusted my schedule to optimize my prime working hours\nThere are certain times in the day where I\u2019m in the zone, I\u2019m creative, and I can get a LOT done - and other times of the day that I\u2019m completely unmotivated, I slack off, and I\u2019m easily distracted\u2026 so I began to re-work my day around my internal schedule, and not try to fit my internal schedule around the day. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to do something similar, really pay attention to your schedule and when you find yourself the most motivated - each of us has our own schedule as to when we hit our \u201cstride,\u201d and when we begin to \u201cburn out.\u201d By figuring this out for myself, I\u2019ve been able to get so much more done by optimizing when my time is best used and doing the most important tasks right then. \n\nTHIRD: Prioritize your ENTIRE DAY.\nThe night before, I\u2019ll open up a notepad on my phone and write out everything that needs to get done, and in what order - starting with the most important task first. Then, that next day, I begin to complete those tasks based on their urgency, and which is the most pressing to get done given my internal schedule. This list keeps you on track at all times, you know EXACTLY what you need to get done, and my day doesn\u2019t end until EVERYTHING on that list is checked off by a certain time. \n\nFOURTH: GET RID OF ALL DISTRACTIONS.\nI\u2019ve started implementing \u201cwork time\u201d - I turn everything on \u201cDo not disturb\u201d for 60 minutes. I purposely close out of all tabs except for what I\u2019m working on, I purposely leave my phone away from me so I\u2019m not tempted to check it, and if anything IS urgent - those people know how to reach me. \n\nI\u2019ve found that since I\u2019ve started doing this, I\u2019ve become a LOT more productive\u2026I\u2019m able to get 3 hours of distracted work done in the time of 1 hour of focus, I have MORE time left over for myself, and can make much better use of the day. \n\nFIFTH: The 2 Minute Rule\nThis is a concept by David Allen, who explains that MOST things we procrastinate on don\u2019t really take much time to do - but for whatever reason, we just tend to procrastinate, thinking we\u2019ll get them done later.  But this rule suggests that whatever you can do in 2 minutes or less, just get it done IMMEDIATELY. Whether it\u2019s making your bed in the morning, putting away your laundry, cleaning the dishes, or anything like that\u2026Don\u2019t THINK about doing it, don\u2019t postpone it later\u20262 minutes, just go and do it right now. \n\n\nSIXTTH: Work on a scalable business\nThis is something I didn\u2019t completely understand or appreciate until I began seeing the potential about 2 years ago\u2026even with this video, the work it takes to reach 1 person is the EXACT same as it takes to reach 1 MILLION people\u2026so my income is no longer dependent on how many hours I work, but on how many people my content can reach. That means my income is able to scale parabolically, without me doing ANYTHING differently, or working even more hours\u2026\n\nThat SINGLE differentiation is what led me to now making well over $1 million per year\u2026Now I\u2019m not going and recommending everyone just go and start YouTube channels\u2026but for anyone who wants to not only be MORE productive, but also scale your income exponentially\u2026you need to get into a business that is NOT dependent on your time, but dependent on the amount of value you provide to an audience. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-10-02T22:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in stocks for beginners","how to invest in real estate for beginners","stock market investing","real estate investing","real estate investing strategies","how to save money","how to save money fast","how to make money online","how to make money fast","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to make passive income","passive income 101","how to make a million dollars"],"title":"How I Manage My Time To Make Over $1 MillIon Per Year","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2imfu6jXcm8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2imfu6jXcm8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2imfu6jXcm8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2imfu6jXcm8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2imfu6jXcm8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT14M33S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1219","dislikeCount":"167","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"16590","viewCount":"201437"}},{"id":"0_CP30ZQJVM","snippet":{"description":"Lets go over exactly how to make $1 million per year, how I was able to do it, and the strategies that I learned along the way - enjoy!

And to understand what those stages are, and how to move past them, we need to start where almost everyone begins: \n\nGETTING PAID FOR YOUR TIME\nThis is, by FAR\u2026how the majority of people are paid and, subsequently, how they think about their income\u2026they trade their time, for a set amount of money every hour, every week, or every month\u2026and from that, their income has a ceiling. They can only work so many hours in a day, they can only make what someone else is willing to pay for their time\u2026and in this stage of income, the only way to make more money is either: Get a raise, get a promotion, or switch to another, higher paying career. \n\nGETTING PAID FOR RESULTS. \nThis is when you get paid based on your performance, or completing a certain task...regardless of the number of hours you work to make that happen. And when you\u2019re getting paid by RESULTS, you can begin earning SUBSTANTIALLY MORE for the exact same time. \n\nFirst, you can work SMARTER - NOT HARDER. \nThe amount of time you spend on something makes no difference whatsoever\u2026it just matters if you actually get results. \n\nSecond, by getting paid on results - your work becomes more sustainable\nEven though your income might fluctuate month by month, because you\u2019re the one in charge of your income - you have more control over the income you make, you can chose to take on more or less work, and you make yourself less replaceable because you\u2019re producing RESULTS. \n\nThird, you can work LESS hours - and still get paid MORE MONEY\nThis is exactly where Pareto\u2019s 80\/20 principle applies\u2026this is the principle that theorizes that 80% of an effect comes from 20% of a cause\u2026or, in other words, 80% of your money comes from the 20% of the time you spend on it. \n\nBut, unfortunately\u2026. as great as getting paid for results is\u2026and as much of an improvement this can be from getting paid  for your time\u2026sometimes, the reality is that there\u2019s only so many results you can get in a day. Even if you\u2019re the BEST at what you do - you still might just reach that soft plateau where you can\u2019t seem to expand\u2026and that\u2019s where our THIRD and FINAL stage comes in\u2026\n\nLEVERAGING YOUR RESULTS\nYou NEED to figure out how to LEVERAGE your results - because, like I said, at a certain point - there\u2019s only so many results you can get in a year before you start to cap out. \n\nFirst, you can do this by HIRING EMPLOYEES and having them work FOR YOU - thereby leveraging your results\nThis is basically Business 101 in a nutshell\u2026you didn\u2019t have Henry Ford going out and building all the cars himself. Instead, he hired employees - leveraged his results - and used that to create an empire. Every single business out there does the same thing, and by leveraging results - you\u2019re able to earn substantially more. \n\nSecond, you can leverage your results by building a business that has the potential to scale without further involvement from you\nAnd this is the route I ended up going, that caused my income to skyrocket so much this year. \n\nFrom that, the BIGGEST lesson I\u2019ve learned is that to go from Stage 2 to Stage 3\u2026and subsequently make over 1 million a year\u2026you NEED to do something that\u2019s beyond YOURSELF. You cannot just work for results, without LEVERAGING those results, and finding a way for that to continue doing the heavy lifting for you, even when you aren\u2019t out there working.\n\nSTAGE 4: \nLeverage the money you make very wisely, so it continues growing BEYOND the work you put in.

Here\u2019s why, my thoughts on Tesla, and some of the potential tax advantages associated with buying the Cyber truck - enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe Program I talk about: The YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to grow an audience, rank videos on the front page of searches, build your brand, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nMy second channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/thegrahamstephanshow\n\nFirst, lets talk about the aesthetics - In terms of practicality, it makes sense: the car is designed for durability. The stainless steel exterior is designed to resist dents, impact, and protect its passengers. \n\nAs Elon Musk clarified on twitter, this type of stainless steel is so strong that it can\u2019t easily be molded and stamped without literally breaking the machine, so building a car from flat shapes meant less work required - and less overhead cost to manufacture. There\u2019s very little on the car to to mold, bend, and shape\u2026instead, just stamp and cut pieces together, and then fold it into a truck.\n\nIn terms of the impressive reservation numbers, however - I do have my doubts, as much as I\u2019m a fan of Tesla. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: I placed my deposit on the Cybertruck because I felt a $100, fully refundable deposit was such a low barrier to entry to reserve a spot - and from there, I could decide 2 years from now whether or not this type of vehicle would be a viable purchase or not. If yes, great - I\u2019ll get the car. If not, well..it was only $100, and I can get it back. \n\nAlthough, I hate to be that guy\u2026especially because I LOVE Tesla, and I also bought Tesla Stock at the same time I bought my Model 3\u2026but I can\u2019t help but think charging a $100 refundable deposit isn\u2019t going to be the best measure as to how many of people will actually end up BUYING the car when it comes out.\n\nI don\u2019t say this to take away from the car\u2026because I think it\u2019s brilliant, and I\u2019m a believer of Elon Musk. But, we can\u2019t ignore that - on previous Tesla models\u2026the deposit was much higher.\n\nThe Tesla Roadster has a $50,000 refundable deposit \nThe Model Y has a refundable deposit of $2500. \nThe Tesla Model 3 had a refundable deposit of $1000. \nAnd when the Tesla Model X was first announced\u2026the deposit ranged from $5000, all the way to $40,000 for a founders series.\nAnd\u2026then\u2026with the Cybertruck\u2026only $100.\n\nWith the Tesla Model 3, they received a whopping 232,000 deposits in the first day - each with a $1000 deposit. \nFor context\u2026that\u2019s equivalent to Tesla receiving $232,000,000\u2026.upfront\u2026for a car that wasn\u2019t even in production yet. So, that was pretty amazing, because $1000 is a pretty strong commitment to buy the car.\nhttps:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2016\/04\/01\/teslas-model-3-has-already-racked-up-232-000-pre-orders\/\n\nFrom that, however\u2026it\u2019s rumored that 25% of those people ended up refunding their pre-order:\nhttps:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2018\/06\/04\/tesla-refunded-a-quarter-of-us-model-3-preorders\/\n\nSo given that, one MIGHT assume that the refund rate for a $100 deposit might be SIGNIFICANTLY higher due to the low barrier to entry. \n\nAs far as tax advantages though, this could be good:\nThis is because It\u2019s estimated that the car is going to be weighing in at over 6000 pounds, much like the Tesla Model X. And that means that it\u2019s eligible for what\u2019s called the Tax Code Section 179 deduction, with\u2026wait for it\u2026BONUS DEPRECIATION. \n\nThis is a deduction that applies to business owners who buy a car weighing more than 6000 pounds, and intend to use the car for MORE than 50% business use.  This type of tax deduction means that heavy vehicles like this, classify as heavy machinery - and from that, section 179 says you can depreciate the car up to $25,000 in the first year. \n\nThen, you have what\u2019s known as \u201cBONUS DEPRECIATION.\u201d That allows you to potentially depreciate 100% of the vehicle you purchased in that SINGLE TAX YEAR. \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/teslamotors\/comments\/bl28kn\/section_179_tesla_model_x\/?st=k3e81hx4&sh=8bb3cc31\n\nAnd for me, that\u2019s why I figured\u2026why not\u2026$100 deposit, I may as well just see what happens\u2026and then, 2 years from now as more options and interior design become more clear, I can decide whether or not I\u2019ll actually get one. Plus, I think a lot of other people are in the same boat, as well. They see it as an innovative, new design\u2026it\u2019s absolutely unique\u2026it\u2019s priced in line with more conventional automobiles\u2026and $100 deposit is such a low barrier for most people just to place and then see what happens. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-26T00:30:00Z","tags":["tesla","tesla cybertruck","cybertruck","tesla model 3","elon musk","tesla review","model 3","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","investing for beginners","investing in your 20s","how to invest in your 20s","how to invest in real estate","how to make money","how to build wealth","credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","how to make passive income","passive income 101","cybertruck review","how to build wealth in your 20s","robinhood","robinhood app","robinhood app review"],"title":"I bought a Tesla Cybertruck for $100","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAqEFBj-6Ug\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAqEFBj-6Ug\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAqEFBj-6Ug\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAqEFBj-6Ug\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cAqEFBj-6Ug\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M39S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2727","dislikeCount":"2400","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"22607","viewCount":"486988"}},{"id":"7yaH9LcDWno","snippet":{"description":"It\u2019s happened\u2026.today, I react to myself on CNBC Make It - Living On $1.6 Million A Year In Los Angeles | Millennial Money - Enjoy!

Not only that, shows you, step by step, how you can manifest anything around you - through your thoughts, which then leads to action, which then leads to results. \n\nSame applies to the book \u201cHow to win friends and influence people,\u201d except this focuses on how you can improve the interpersonal relationships you\u2019ll have in life, and business - and how to get people on your side. Because here\u2019s the reality: if you want to make a LOT of money and build your wealth, in some way or another, you\u2019re going to have to communicate or interact with people.\n\nSECOND: Figure out how to make money\nTake some time to learn about different industries, figure out what you want to do, and how you intend to make money. Then, start studying how to do that WITHOUT SPENDING A SINGLE DIME - this part of your journey should be ABSOLUTELY FREE.\n\nTHIRD: Get experience doing it\nDon\u2019t wait, just start. There is NO BETTER learning experience than literally just going for it - because I\u2019ll tell you, there will NEVER be a point where you\u2019ll feel completely \u201cready\u201d to do it. Most of the time, you\u2019ll be in your head worrying about whether or not you know enough, or you\u2019ll be doubting if you\u2019re making the right choices or not, or if you should spend your time doing something else\u2026that never goes away. \n\nFOURTH: Learn from someone else\nFrom my experience, usually the BEST education you can get - comes from just working for free, and observing what other people are doing. \n\nFIFTH: Try as many things as possible\nI really think that the MORE options you give yourself early on, the BETTER the outcome will be\u2026you\u2019ll be exposed to so much more, you\u2019ll get a wide variety of experiences, and from that - you\u2019ll be better able to chose an option that really works best with you. \n\nSIXTH: Take risk \nYou could totally afford to lose absolutely everything - and chances are, that\u2019s not that much to begin with, so you\u2019ll be totally fine. Plus, you\u2019ll have your entire life ahead of you to come back from it even stronger. \n\nSEVENTH: Set good financial habits\n-ALWAYS save a certain percentage of your income, no matter what. \n-ALWAYS live below your means\n-Sstart tracking your income and expenses\n-stay out of consumer debt, like credit card debt - or any type of debt that costs too much and doesn\u2019t make money\n-invest your money consistently, which I\u2019ll mention shortly \n\nSecond: Open up a secured credit card and build up your credit score\nWatch Here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/ukaWAjgkH9M\n\nThird: Open up a Roth IRA. \nThis is a retirement account where you can contribute and invest after-tax money, and then all of the profit within that account is COMPLETELY tax free after the age of 59.5. This means that, as a teenager, you can get DECADES of compound interest - completely tax free - and basically be rich as fuck by the time you\u2019re ready to retire. \n\nFourth, when you invest your money - INVEST LONG TERM. \nThis means your investment will have more time to recover in the event prices go down, it means you\u2019re less likely to emotionally buy or sell investments with the expectation of profiting and making quick money, and it means you\u2019re likely be more rational with what you do. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-18T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to build wealth","how to build wealth with low income","how to build wealth with no money","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to build wealth in your teens","how to save money","how to save money fast","credit score explained","credit score increase","how to invest","investing for beginners","investing with no money","how to make money online","robinhood","robinhood app","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","investing 101","investing explained"],"title":"How To Build Wealth In Your Teens","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GSUYGHh-D5w\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GSUYGHh-D5w\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GSUYGHh-D5w\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GSUYGHh-D5w\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GSUYGHh-D5w\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M32S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4989","dislikeCount":"1591","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"160876","viewCount":"1259609"}},{"id":"63ErDQKpchg","snippet":{"description":"A study shows that Millennials are earning 20% less money than previous generations - here is why, and what you can do about it.

And those careers are also seeing the highest growth in populated cities - which, just happens to be where economy is leaning, and where job growth is most competitive. . \n\nNext: WAGE GROWTH\nIf we look at hourly earnings since the 1960\u2019s\u2026we can see that our wages haven\u2019t really changed, adjusted for inflation\u2026while the price of EVERYTHING ELSE has been going up much faster.. Meaning\u2026millennials are effectively earning \u201cless\u201d for doing the same work. \nhttps:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2019\/04\/50-years-of-us-wages-in-one-chart\/\n\nFirst, it\u2019s no surprise more people are entering the workforce - that means employers can be pickier about who they hire, and pay LESS because there are MORE people wanting the same job. This competition means employers don\u2019t NEED to increase salaries, because they have no problem filling those positions with people willing to work.\n\nSecondly, education: In fact, the value and earnings of a college degree seemed to have peaked in the late 1990\u2019s\u2026and since then, it\u2019s seen a very slow decline given the cost of skyrocketing education, and the lessened value as it becomes more common. This could be the reason why we\u2019re more educated than ever, but not seeing as high of a  monetary return as we \u201cshould\u201d see.\nhttps:\/\/www.epi.org\/publication\/charting-wage-stagnation\/\n\nThird, during a recession, employers are often quick to cut and decrease salaries\u2026but during the GOOD TIMES, they\u2019re much SLOWER to raise them back up. And  again - the data backs this up, showing that we\u2019re just NOW getting back to the point we were at\u202610 years ago.  \nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/fredgraph.png?width=880&height=440&id=MEHOINUSA672N\n\nThere are multiple studies that have shown that people who switch jobs every 2-3 years make nearly 50% more than someone who stays with the same company. \nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cameronkeng\/2014\/06\/22\/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less\/#6b8e42c1e07f\n\nSo given that, if you find yourself making less money than you\u2019re happy with - consider switching jobs and looking elsewhere - and that might help give you that 20% pay boost to make up for that sad statistic. \n\nSo given all of that, your highest chance of earning more money is to specialize in a field that\u2019s IN DEMAND, where you\u2019re GOOD at what you do, and make yourself difficult to replace. The job market DOES reward talent, but it DOESN\u2019T reward loyalty\u2026so switching companies is often the BEST way to make more money, and sharpen your skills as necessary. In addition to that, consider re-locating to areas which pay more - those happen to be bigger, metropolitan cities\u2026but, in terms of which areas are paying more than others\u2026the results are pretty evident. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-15T23:30:00Z","tags":["how to invest","how to invest in stocks","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","investing in your 20s","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","stock market investing for beginners","investing for beginners","investing for beginners with little money","investing money","investing apps","robinhood","robinhood app","real estate investing","how to make money","how to make money fast","credit score","credit score increase","how to make passive income","passive income"],"title":"Why Millennials Don\u2019t Make Enough Money","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63ErDQKpchg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63ErDQKpchg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63ErDQKpchg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63ErDQKpchg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63ErDQKpchg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M11S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1729","dislikeCount":"459","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"24970","viewCount":"257627"}},{"id":"N6QdxWyP8HI","snippet":{"description":"Lets answer the question: How to fix a bad credit score FAST, and the best techniques you can use to improve your credit score as quick as possible, for totally free - Enjoy!

The process is fairly simple, it shouldn\u2019t take too long, and the increase in your score should help save you a TON of money in future loans you get, mortgages you borrow, or even just getting approved to rent an apartment - the benefits from doing this are immeasurable. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-13T23:30:01Z","tags":["credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","how to fix your credit","how to fix bad credit","bad credit cards","robinhood","robinhood app","investing 101","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","investing in your 20s","investing for beginners","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to make money online","passive income","passive income 101","passive income ideas","credit card","credit card 101"],"title":"How To Fix A BAD Credit Score ASAP","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N6QdxWyP8HI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N6QdxWyP8HI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N6QdxWyP8HI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N6QdxWyP8HI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/N6QdxWyP8HI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M12S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"11412","dislikeCount":"1102","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"80336","viewCount":"1178828"}},{"id":"tAO-Ff7_4CE","snippet":{"description":"After the Robinhood incident, lets discuss how they make money - what this means for the company - and how this might affect their potential IPO.

Those firms usually earn a very, very small percentage off the trade\u2026according to Bloomberg, that was $0.0024 cents per share,\u201d but with $150 billion in trading volume, it adds up. \nhttps:\/\/outline.com\/zwzzVm\n\nBesides that, they\u2019ll make some eventual interchange fees with their cash management debit card, and I\u2019m sure they have a few other things in the works\u2026but I have no clue whether or not they\u2019re actually a profitable company, and what they plan on doing to eventually expand into banking and lending services, etc. \n\nIn terms of where we go from here\u2026well, IDEALLY, Robinhood fixes the glitch and sweeps it under the rug - and then keeps a close eye on for anyone else trying to exploit any faults or glitches within the system. \n\nLike I said\u2026mistakes and glitches happen, no one expects Robinhood to be perfect. But how they handle those mistakes is going to be an indication of how they\u2019ll handle FUTURE issues, as well\u2026which is inevitable, and it happens to every business out there. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Robinhood - and many of the other brokerages out there - changed the way Margin Accounts are handled. Realistically, there\u2019s no rational reason why everyone is given the same access to margin\u2026because if you have $2000, agree to pay for Robinhood gold,  and a 5% margin interest rate, you can borrow up to 50% of your purchase to invest. In NO other industry would you be able to do that...so it doesn\u2019t make sense that this would be the case for an asset like stocks, at least without a little more thorough background check. \n\nFinally\u2026let me say this. I have nothing against Robinhood, I use them, and I think they\u2019re an overall great platform. If it wasn\u2019t for them, I bet NONE of us would be seeing free stock trades today - we almost certainly owe that to them, and they\u2019ve absolutely shaken up the entire industry in such a great way. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-08T23:30:00Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood investing","robinhood investing app","investing app","how to trade stocks","how to buy stocks","stock market investing","stock market investing for beginners","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to build wealth","how to build wealth fast","how to make money","how to make money online","real estate 101","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","how to invest in your 20s","stock trading app","credit score"],"title":"What you MUST KNOW about Robinhood Investing","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tAO-Ff7_4CE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tAO-Ff7_4CE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tAO-Ff7_4CE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tAO-Ff7_4CE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tAO-Ff7_4CE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M16S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1737","dislikeCount":"479","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"14373","viewCount":"688826"}},{"id":"hdYyZlqyc_Y","snippet":{"description":"PLEASE SEE DISCLAIMER IN VIDEO DESCRIPTION.

This user found a way to \u201cTrick\u201d Robinhood into lending him money\u2026.almost infinitely, as much money as he likes\u2026through an error in Robinhood\u2019s system, without them even realizing it. \n\nHe went and opened up a Robinhood Gold account and deposited $2000 on the platform. Robinhood then gave him an addition $2000 as a loan on Margin. That means he now DOUBLED his purchasing power almost instantaneously. \n\nHe then went and spent $3800 buying 100 stocks of AMD - $2000 was from his own money, and $1800 was borrowed from Robinhood. And this is where the master-trickery loophole begins. \n\nRobinhood allows you to do what\u2019s called OPTIONS TRADING. This is where you can sell someone the OPTION to BUY your stock from you at a certain price, which is known as the STRIKE PRICE. \n\nIn this case, he sold ALL of his AMD stock - that he JUST BOUGHT - on a CALL OPTION\u2026meaning, someone will pay him back ALL the money he spent buying AMD stocks, minus $2 per share\u2026and THAT person gets the right to buy his stocks in the future, for the low price of $2 - again, that\u2019s known as the strike price. \n\nBUT\u2026he cleverly figured out that Robinhood based their margin level on the assets within his account, meaning he gets back $3600 from selling AMD options\u2026of which, he bought with loaned money from Robinhood\u2026but Robinhood would see $3600 in his account, and Double THAT with another $3600 worth of Margin\u2026and within minutes, he now has $7200 to buy more stock with. \n\nKnowing this, he goes ahead and repeats the same thing - but this time, he buys 200 shares of AMD, sells the call option to receive almost all of his money back\u2026which is then doubled AGAIN by Robinhood\u2019s margin\u2026and he continues doing that as much as he wants, racking up as more and more money within his account. Up to the point where Robinhood was lending him $25 for every $1 he invested of his own money in the platform\u2026.\n\nIDEALLY\u2026Robinhood should\u2019ve seen that he was selling options, and not loaned him ANY MORE than a 2-to-1 ratio from what his NET account value was\u2026but, obviously, they didn\u2019t catch it\u2026and you can see his account still showed his Margin Health as being: GOOD \u2026.even though he was up to his eyeballs in debt, and risky investments. \nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/7F6Mo4C.png\n\nSee, the REAL issue is whether or not Robinhood has a legal obligation to protect people from themselves, and to make sure there\u2019s NO CHANCE of this ever happening in the future. \n\nBut until then, it\u2019s been a VERY interesting journey to follow this saga\u2026and it\u2019ll definitely be interesting to see how this all plays out! \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-05T22:15:01Z","tags":["ROBINHOOD","robinhood loophole","robinhood glitch","robinhood app","robinhood investing","robinhood app review","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","stock market investing","real estate investing","investing in stocks","investing in your 20s","investing 101","how to make money in stocks","how to trade stocks","how ot buy stocks","how i became a millionaire","PASSIVE INCOME"],"title":"ROBINHOOD LOOPHOLE GIVES YOU INFINITE MONEY","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdYyZlqyc_Y\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdYyZlqyc_Y\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdYyZlqyc_Y\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdYyZlqyc_Y\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdYyZlqyc_Y\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT15M51S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"2091","dislikeCount":"438","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"18122","viewCount":"368918"}},{"id":"3dkCrKR5cuQ","snippet":{"description":"This video is Sponsored by Credit Sesame, sign up for free today:\u00a0https:\/\/secure.creditsesame.com\/click?campaignId=grahamstephan&adgroupId=ShoutoutNov2019&src=Influencer&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.creditsesame.com\/myfreecreditscore&utm_content=YouTube&utm_source=YouTube&utm_medium=influencer #Sponsored\n\nCredit Sesame\u2019s mission is to help consumers improve their credit health and ultimately create better opportunities for themselves and their families.

Even though, it\u2019s also as simple as: just don\u2019t spend money. \n\nInstead, to me, Financial Minimalism supports the notion that it\u2019s OK to spend money on something and treat yourself\u2026as long as that \u2018something\u2019 brings you the equivalent amount of value as what you spent on it, and as long as you couldn\u2019t get a better value for that spending elsewhere. It\u2019s all about MAXIMIZING your value when you do spend money, then MINIMIZING the experiences that aren\u2019t as important - and that then brings us to our first financial minimalism principle:\n\nSECOND: CUTTING OUT EVERYTHING YOU DON\u2019T NEED TO SPEND MONEY ON\n\nThe basis of this is that the LESS financial overhead you have, the more \u201cPROFIT\u201d you have left over. \n\nOne, you\u2019re going to sort through everything you DON\u2019T NEED OR DON\u2019T USE - and then you can cut it out entirely\n\nTwo, you\u2019ll have a second category of expenses you can negotiate and shop around for \nThis might include a health insurance plan, car insurance, home insurance, or even a mortgage\u2026I\u2019ve literally gone through EVERY recurring charge of mine and found a way to bring costs down.  \n\nThree, you\u2019ll have a list of your expenses that you can just cut back on:\n\nNow, remember\u2026Financial Minimalism is NOT about just cutting as much spending as you possibly can, selling all your furniture, and living in a tent\u2026but, it IS about recognizing which spending habits are really contributing the most to your overall enjoyment of life, and cutting out everything else that\u2019s unnecessary and holding you back from reaching that goal. \n\nThird: Try to find the BEST VALUE for what you DO SPEND. \nThis one is JUST about realizing where you get the most enjoyment for your spending, and what\u2019s going to bring you the best \u201cbang for the buck\u201d in terms of your happiness\u2026then trying to find the best financial value, while removing everything else that gets in the way. \n\nFourth: Learn to live on less, despite how much you make\nFrom my own experience, after a few months of doing this, you\u2019ll VERY quickly realize that you could just as easily spend less money without even realizing it, you won\u2019t worsen your quality of life, and you\u2019ll be JUST as happy spending less as you were spending more. Once you see this for yourself, firsthand - you\u2019ll start to decouple the thought that money brings more happiness - and you\u2019ll WANT to start saving more money, knowing that the more you save, the more OPTIONS that will give you in the future. \n\nFIFTH: INVEST YOUR MONEY\nThe more money you have saved and invested, the more FREEDOM is brings you\u2026plain and simple. You\u2019ll have the freedom to leave the job you hate, to work on the projects you find most fulfilling, or just go AWOL and work on your hobbies all day long. \n\nLAST: Think about what you REALLY think about what you want out of life, and what\u2019s going to make you happy. In other words, what are you doing all of this for?\nI just know there won\u2019t be ANY better motivation to actually go and do this, than if you envision your perfect lifestyle in your head, and know that every purchase you make will either bring you closer - or further way - from actually reaching that goal. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-04T23:30:00Z","tags":["financial minimalist","financial minimalism","minimalism","how to save money","how to build wealth","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","how to invest in your 20s","investing","investing 101","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","how to increase your credit score","credit score increase","how to be a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","minimalist lifestyle","how to save money fast","how to be a millionaire in 3 years","investing for beginners"],"title":"How To Be A Financial Minimalist","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3dkCrKR5cuQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3dkCrKR5cuQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3dkCrKR5cuQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3dkCrKR5cuQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3dkCrKR5cuQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M56S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1087","dislikeCount":"278","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"13972","viewCount":"248075"}},{"id":"6M3hBpxAtBc","snippet":{"description":"Let\u2019s talk about the recent change to Robinhood Cash Management Account, Lower Interest Rates, and what this means for you - enjoy!

The bank makes a profit on the spread between the return on investment they receive, and what they pay YOU as interest\u2026\n\nNow in terms of how much a bank can actually make by \u201cINVESTING YOUR MONEY,\u201d this amount is largely influenced by what\u2019s called: THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. This is basically the interest rate that BANKS pay any time they borrow money from the Federal Reserve. So, in a sense, the Federal Reserve is almost like a Bank\u2026for the Banks.  \n\nThis is important because this Federal Funds Rate impacts what\u2019s known as the Treasury Yield, which is the amount of interest the GOVERNMENT will pay you for lending THEM money\u2026and THOSE returns are largely driven by market supply and demand. \n\nWhen the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, it also inadvertently lowers the treasury yield\u2026which is what banks partially base their savings account payouts from. So, when treasury yields go DOWN\u2026banks won\u2019t make as high of a return on their money\u2026and, therefore, they have less to pay YOU in interest\u2026if that makes sense. \n\nThis is why the FED cutting interest rates doesn\u2019t JUST impact Robinhood, even though they were the first to announce a reduction to their cash account\u2026this will impact EVERY single bank out there, and EVERYONE will soon follow. \n\nHow much they decide to reduce interest rates will mostly depend on: how much those banks charge their borrowers, how much cash they have on hand, and how aggressively they want to keep their customers\u2026the more their pay, the more likely they are to retain money\u2026but that also means, the less money that bank is to make. \n\nThis is why ONLINE banks often can afford to pay WAY more for their savings accounts, because they don\u2019t have high overhead, and they have more money left over to retain YOU as the customer and get your business. \n\nBesides that\u2026I would say that you should carry on as normal, invest with the expectation of holding long term, and consider shopping around banks if you feel like you can get a higher interest rate going somewhere else. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-11-01T22:00:01Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood investing","robinhood app","robinhood app review","m1 finance","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest for beginners","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","how to build wealth","how to invest in your 20s","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to make money","how to make money online","how to increase your credit score","credit score explained","passive income","passive income 101","investing 101"],"title":"Robinhood just sent me this..","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6M3hBpxAtBc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6M3hBpxAtBc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6M3hBpxAtBc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6M3hBpxAtBc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6M3hBpxAtBc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1307","dislikeCount":"224","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7689","viewCount":"174447"}},{"id":"F2yYiTKRizE","snippet":{"description":"Lets go over (in my opinion) the BEST bank accounts out there and the specifics that make them so appealing - enjoy!

Many elements have been exaggerated for comedic effect. Do your own research and come to your own conclusion. This is not financial advice - for entertainment purposes only! \n\nThese are all banks that - in my opinion - are some of the best out there. These are the banks without minimums, fees, and other absurd charges - that also pay you a very good interest rate on your money. Generally, online banks have much less overhead and - because of that - they can pass those savings on to you by paying significantly more in interest!\n\nNumber 5: Discover Bank\nThis bank has no minimums, no monthly maintenance, free access to over 60,000 ATMs, AND pays a 1.7% interest rate on their savings account. With their checking account, even though they don\u2019t pay you any interest - they WILL give you 1% cash back with their debit card, which is better than nothing - and way more than most banks ever give you. \n\nNumber 4: Ally Bank\nYou\u2019ll enjoy all the benefits of no fees, no account minimums, no fees on incoming wires, and no fees on cashiers checks. And in terms of the fees they DO have\u2026they\u2019re pretty upfront with what they charge. In addition to that,  with their checking account, you can also make .1% in interest for doing absolutely nothing\u2026and half a percent if you have above $15,000. Their savings account will pay 1.6% on all balances. \n\nNumber 3: Capital One 360 \nWhen you open an account - you\u2019ll have zero fees and zero minimums. BUT\u2026where this comes in SLIGHTLY better than Ally, is with the interest they pay in their checking account. Capital One 360 will pay you 0.2% on ALL BALANCES, regardless of how much you have\u2026so this is PERFECT for people who keep less than $15,000 in their checking account. What makes THIS bank slightly different than most other banks I\u2019ve mentioned, is that they have physical branches that you can walk into and speak with someone in person - known as a CAPITAL ONE CAFE. Besides that, you\u2019ve also got their 360 SAVINGS ACCOUNT - that pays you a 1.7% interest rate on your money. \n\nNumber 2: Red Neck Bank\nYes, that is REALLY the name of this bank. Buy they\u2019ve got some really great services - like their checking account: no minimum balance, no maintenance fees, $25 per month in free ATM services, and 2.25% in interest up to the first $10,000. And then you can get their MEGA MONEY MARKET ACCOUN, which offers 1.75% in interest up to the first $50,000\u2026and then .5% for anything after that. \n\nNumber 1: Vio Bank (Savings Only)\nThe advantage of this is that it pays one of the HIGHEST interest rates out there right now\u2026at a whopping 2.02% interest, with no cap as to how much money they\u2019ll pay that on. Now, sure\u2026it\u2019s not a full on bank, but the other 4 options I just mentioned are\u2026so, I think this 5th option would just be for the person who wants the highest interest rate out there in a savings account, and that\u2019s it\u2026then, here you go. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Money like this is unconditionally life changing, no matter how it was spent, and the generosity of Mr Beast to give away SO MUCH is absolutely selfless. Not to mention, he recently hit his goal of planting 20,000,000 trees\u2026so I think it\u2019s safe to say, Mr Beast is definitely out there making a HUGE difference, and making such a positive impact on the planet. \n\nIt really goes to show you how much of a difference each of us can make, and Mr Beast has taken that to the EXTREME by HELPING AND GIVING just about everything he\u2019s made. So, I just want to make it clear that - no matter HOW this money was spent - Mr Beast changed this winner\u2019s life forever - and this is something that not only helps Mark, but his entire family as well. \n\nIn terms of Taxes:\nAnytime you win money like this, the IRS will tax you on the VALUE of what you\u2019ve received, and treat it as though it\u2019s the same as your EARNED INCOME. From the $1 Million Dollar Winnings, Mark - the winner - gave $100,000 to his challenge coach, Chandler, and another $50,000 to a past contestant, Jeremy\u2026so now, he\u2019s left with $850,000 in prize money - and THAT is the amount he is now going to be taxed on.  It\u2019s estimated that he\u2019d pay 40% of that amount in taxes\u2026which works out to be $340,000\u2026leaving him with $510,000 left over to do whatever he wants with. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to recognize that - ANYTIME someone receives a windfall like this - it\u2019s easy to have a false sense of security, or to lose perspective as to how far $510,000 really goes. After all, once the $510,000 is gone - it\u2019s gone, and it isn\u2019t coming back. \n\nIDEALLY, in this type of situation\u2026or, in any situation where you suddenly receive or inherit a large sum of money\u2026the BEST thing you can do is lock it away for 1 year in a high interest savings account or short term CD, and JUST DO NOTHING. Give your body, and your mind, enough time to adjust to having that amount of money so that you won\u2019t get caught up in the excitement of having more money than you know what to do with. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026I also don\u2019t know the context of these winnings, or if it was a condition to go and splurge on loved ones if you won the $1 million dollars\u2026because, from a content perspective, THIS is the right thing to do. Going and spending for other people would make really fun content, it makes you feel really good, and filming that would give Mr Beast MORE opportunities to give away MORE money in the future, to MORE people. \n\nSure, he could\u2019ve priced shopped\u2026he could\u2019ve been thriftier\u2026he could\u2019ve invested more\u2026but if it\u2019s for content, that\u2019s not the point of the video. This video makes you feel good, it\u2019s nice to see him so happy and excited, and It brings back your faith in humanity to see him care for the people he loves. \n\nI don\u2019t say this to try and take away from Mr Beast\u2019s video, or to downplay the significance of how life changing this money is to Mark. Mr Beast gave away MORE money than most people could ever even FATHOM, he\u2019s changed so many lives, and even if Mark spent ever last dollar of it - it was put to good use, and his life will forever be changed for the better. Not to mention, at the end of the day\u2026Mark DID get a paid off house and two really nice, paid off cars - that will ALWAYS have value - so, in a sense, the money WAS put to a practical use, and he can always have that available. \n\nHowever, with the money that\u2019s left over - it\u2019s REALLY important to play it smart and to now start investing as much as you possible can, NOW, while you\u2019re young\u2026because, thanks to compound interest, you have time to grow that money into something SIGNIFICANT in the future, giving you 10x more stuff LATER than you can buy right now. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-12-23T20:00:06Z","tags":["mr beast","mr beast 1 million dollars","mr beast 1000000","spending 1000000","spending 1 million dollars","winning 1 million dollars","winning 1000000","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","stock market investing","how to become a millionaire","how i became a millionaire","how to make passive income","robinhood","robinhood app","credit score","credit score explained","how to build wealth"],"title":"The Problem With Spending $1,000,000 In 24 Hours | Mr Beast","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tDAttCVIuF0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tDAttCVIuF0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tDAttCVIuF0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tDAttCVIuF0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tDAttCVIuF0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT17M36S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6415","dislikeCount":"3645","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"94875","viewCount":"1579621"}},{"id":"q96HdYJHVTQ","snippet":{"description":"Just started demo on my property - here is the current update and all the remodeling that\u2019s just begun - enjoy!

But, my philosophy is that being a landlord is VERY MUCH a people business, whether you like it or not. It\u2019s just as much about CUSTOMER SERVICE as it is about picking a worthwhile investment that\u2019ll make you your money back - and it\u2019s all about finding the right combination so that you have a happy tenant, AND you get paid on time every month to make a profit. \n\nPart of that has to do with screening your tenant REALLY, REALLY well BEFORE they move in, to prevent any disastrous situations from happening in the first place\u2026but, once they move in...in a way, they become your CUSTOMER. And the longer that person becomes your customer, the better it will be for everyone involved. Tenants don\u2019t usually like moving around, and landlords don\u2019t like having to fill vacancies\u2026so, I try to go out of my way to make sure the tenant is as happy as possible, and wants to stay as long as they like. Even if that means I\u2019ll lose a little money every now and then, in the LONG TERM - I know I\u2019ll make it back, plus WAY MORE. \n\nThere\u2019s also few windows that will HAVE to be replaced because they\u2019re beyond repairing. HOWEVER\u2026once I replace a few, I starting thinking to myself\u2026well, I may as well replace THEM ALL NOW, so they match. \n\nOn the one hand, I won\u2019t really get more money in rent for having all new windows\u2026and replacing everything will cost me an extra $9000 for materials and installation HOWEVER\u2026if I DID change them out, having new windows be one less thing to replace in the future. AND\u2026if I\u2019m going to replace them, NOW is the time to do it\u2026not to mention, they might be appreciated by the tenant who moves in next. \n\nBut, is it really worth the cost to replace windows that are perfectly functional\u2026but just a little old?\n\nAlthough, I gotta say\u2026overall\u2026this process has been going really smoothly. The demo of this unit should hopefully be done by the time this video is posted, and then they can begin re-building it up and getting it back to looking as good as new\u2026because\u2026well\u2026it will be new. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Anytime I look for a bank to put my money, I pay close attention to any monthly maintenance fees, cost of sending or receiving wires, how to waive those fees, and the interest I\u2019ll be paid from that account.\n\nGenerally, online banks have much less overhead and - because of that - they can pass those savings on to you by paying significantly more in interest. Many of those banks also don\u2019t have as many fees as traditional banks do. \n\nNumber 5: Chase Bank\nThis is disappointing for me to mention, because the Chase Sapphire Reserve is one of my favorite Credit Cards, not to mention that Chase has several of the BEST credit cards currently on the market, all with REALLY good rewards.  Chase Bank ALSO holds 2 of my mortgages, and they had INSANELY good interest rate at the time I applied\u2026plus, their Chase Private Client services and perks are phenomenal when you deposit more than $250,000 with them\u2026however, I have to say it\u2026I have to call them out for this, because to me\u2026 their actual bank account is just\u2026BAD. \n\nNumber 4: Bank of America\nIn their defense, hey\u2019ve got a REALLY great credit card for people just starting out and building their credit, the Bank Of America Cash Rewards Card. They also have REALLY great mortgage rates\u2026I refinanced one of my properties through them, and they were awesome. And their mobile app is REALLY easy to use, and the entire online interface is AWESOME. But, for me\u2026.the friendship ends there, and that\u2019s where the line is drawn. \n\nNumber 3: Wells Fargo\nWells Fargo has been one of the only Bank Account I have EVER gone out of my way to cancel. Typically, it\u2019s easy for me to keep $1500 in an account just to keep it open and maintain that relationship with the bank in the event I ever use them for a mortgage\u2026but, nope, this was just SO bad that I couldn\u2019t stand to keep it open. \n\nNumber 2: US Bank\nUnfortunately, the number of fees - combined with how little they pay you in interest - makes this bank rather unappealing. \n\nNumber 1: CitiBank\nThis is the ONLY OTHER bank that I have gone OUT OF MY WAY TO CANCEL because it was just SO BAD. This is another one that I don\u2019t like to mention\u2026because their Double Cash rewards credit card is AWESOME\u2026but the bank itself, from my experience, is a different story. \n\nSome better options (Not paid to say this, not sponsored - just my opinion):\nAlly Bank, no fees, no minimums - 1.7% interest\nMarcus by Goldman Sachs - no fees, no minimums, 1.7% interest\nCIT Bank, no fees, $1000 minimum, but pays 1.8%\nPNC Bank - No fees, no minimums, 1.7% Interest \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is when you borrow money in order to invest\u2026and that investment, ideally, makes you MORE money than what you owe in interest on that loan. \n\nNow, here\u2019s why borrowing money just makes WAY more sense for me\u2026and exactly why I do it:\n\nIn Real Estate, you have two options for buying a property - one, is owning it outright and paying for it in cash - and the other, which is what MOST people do - is borrowing money and taking out a \u201cmortgage.\u201d  And taking out a loan like this means you could make WAY more money than you could, otherwise.\n\nIn addition to that, the INTEREST I pay on those 30 year, fixed rate mortgages also becomes a tax write off against that rental income - which means, it helps lower my tax bill. \n\nBut, it doesn\u2019t stop quite there\u2026because when taking out a long term loan, we also have consider the power of INFLATION. \n\nThis is what happens when more money is printed into our economy, and the more money that gets printed, the less value our money is worth.\n\nThis is also how I\u2019m, EFFECTIVELY, able to borrow money COMPLETELY FOR FREE - meaning, it\u2019s CHEAPER for me to BORROW money, than it is for me to PAY for it, outright\u2026if that sounds like science fiction, here\u2019s how I\u2019m able to do it:\n\nFirst, I\u2019m getting a low interest, 30-year, fixed rate loan. My AVERAGE interest rate, throughout the 3 mortgages I already have, on about $1.7 million dollars, is 3.52%. \n\nWhen you consider that the interest rate is a tax write off against the rental income I make, in a 50% tax bracket, it\u2019s essentially like I\u2019m only paying HALF that, after taxes - or, 1.76% \u201cout of pocket\u201d in actual interest. \n\nThen, that amount is also lowered by inflation - because, every year, my outstanding loan balance becomes \u201ceasier\u201d to pay off with future money that\u2019s worth less. \n\nIf we see that, this year - inflation was 1.76% - that means, when you factor in inflation and tax write offs - I\u2019m getting loaned money, for 30 years, for completely FREE - adjusted for inflation. Not to mention, there may be some years where inflation is HIGHER than 1.76% - which means, in a weird way, banks will be paying ME to take out loans, to buy properties\u2026so, in this case, it makes ABSOLUTELY no sense for me to pay this loan off early. \n\nFirst, if I paid for any of my properties outright, or I paid off any of my current mortgages - I would be tying up a LOT of money in one place, meaning I couldn\u2019t use it towards any OTHER investments - and that has what\u2019s known as an \u201copportunity cost.\u201d \n\nSecond, by borrowing money - as odd as this is to say - I\u2019m able to diversify my investments much more, allowing me a much safer spread on my money. \n\nNow, I will say - there ARE some advantages when it comes to paying in cash, and not having a mortgage, so I do think these are worth mentioning - just so I can give a well balanced argument to this video:\n\nFirst, when you pay cash for something - you have a LOT less risk:.\n\nSecond, when you own something outright - you\u2019ll have a LOT more peace of mind\n\nAnd third, paying for something outright in cash is really, really easy. \n\nBUT\u2026overall, having done BOTH\u2026I\u2019ve bought properties outright, and I\u2019ve bought them with a mortgage\u2026I have to say, I\u2019d take the mortgage route every single time. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Not only that, but they\u2019re ALSO going to be allowing RECURRING INVESTMENTS and DRIP, which stands for DIVIDEND RE-INVESTMENT PLAN. \n\nBy allowing fractional shares and dividend re-investment, Robinhood can get people investing on their platform with MUCH less money - as little as $1, and that will open the door for so many people to invest in larger, more expensive stocks - like Google, Amazon, and Tesla\u2026without needing to come up with the entire amount. \n\nIt also allows its users to get MUCH more diversification, and invest much more safety across various stocks - rather than tie up all their money within just a few. For example, instead of investing in Facebook with $200\u2026you could literally go out there and spread your money across 20 DIFFERENT stocks, each for $10. That would give you a much broader return, and a much more stable investment - without as high of an initial cost. \n\nAnd as for Robinhood\u2026as good of a platform as they still are, I STILL think they\u2019ve got a long way to improve. For example, WeBull has already announced that they\u2019ve implemented a Roth IRA\u2026and Robinhood has yet to do that. WeBull is also about to be offering FREE Options Trading\u2026and, as of now, Robinhood has been charging $5 per month for the privilege of that, as well as with margin trading. \n\nI\u2019d also like to see Robinhood improve their customer service to the point where you can call in and speak to a live human being\u2026and that\u2019s a MAJOR advantage that Charles Schwab has. I also think Robinhood would benefit from getting this Cash Management account available as soon as possible\u2026as well as partnering with a bank to open up their own Robinhood-branded Credit Card\u2026preferably, with a sign up bonus.\n\nBut, overall\u2026like I\u2019ve said before\u2026all of this is REALLY, REALLY good for you as the customer, and investing in fractional shares is a huge win in my books. The more these companies compete, the more they innovate, the more they all \u201cRace to the bottom\u201d - and ultimately, investing becomes cheaper and more easily accessible to even more people out there. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-12-13T21:00:05Z","tags":["robinhood","robinhood investing","robinhood app","robinhood app review","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","investing for beginners","investing 101","investing in real estate","investing in your 20s","credit score","credit score review","credit score increase","credit score explained","how to build wealth","how to become a millionaire","fractional shares","charles schwab","How to become a millionaire","how to be a millionaire in 3 years","stock market investing","real estate investing"],"title":"ROBINHOOD JUST LAUNCHED A $1 INVESTMENT","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/om7kI5ZQOxs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/om7kI5ZQOxs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/om7kI5ZQOxs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/om7kI5ZQOxs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/om7kI5ZQOxs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT11M35S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1233","dislikeCount":"133","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"7378","viewCount":"154763"}},{"id":"HDsWJnHTcQg","snippet":{"description":"My tenant just moved out - here is what happened, and my plans for remodeling this property - enjoy!

From my experience with tenants\u2026if something CAN break, it WILL. So spend more money on things that are built to last as long as possible, and that will mean more profit for you long term. \n\nSecond, BUDGET that it will always cost you more than you think it will\nEven though $65,000 is the amount I expect this to cost\u2026trust me, I\u2019ll look be looking back on this and shaking my head because I\u2019m pretty sure there will need to be other small changes made throughout the process that will end up costing more. Maybe I could be wrong\u2026but, I\u2019m not wrong. If you\u2019re remodeling something, always give yourself a 25% buffet to go over budget if you need to - otherwise, you risk running out of money. \n\nAnd third, always monitor the work that\u2019s being done\nEven though I trust my contractors thoroughly - sometimes, if they\u2019re not around supervising, things can fall through the cracks and get missed. I like to check in the progress every day, or every other day if I\u2019m really busy - not only is this a great way to learn how the work is being done, but you can make sure everything is done to your liking. I\u2019ve walked in previous projects and seen this mis-aligned, screwed sticking out of cabinetry, using wrong grout color\u2026the list goes on. \n\nAbsolutely expect some updates on the progress of this unit throughout the next few months\u2026I\u2019ll do more frequent, vlog style updates on my second channel, The Graham Stephan Show - so if you want to more closely follow the progress, go and subscribe to that channel and you\u2019ll be able to see the progression.\n\nBut, overall\u2026I\u2019m excited to show you the before and after, this is type of real estate work I really enjoy - and there\u2019s something to be said about putting your own creative touch on a place, and transforming it into something like this - into a place where people would be really happy to live in. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-12-11T23:30:01Z","tags":["real estate","real estate 101","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","real estate investing with no money","remodeling","remodeling before and after","remodeling kitchen","credit score","credit score explained","how to increase your credit score","robinhood","robinhood app","real estate agent","real estate investing strategies","investing","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing in your 20s","how to make passive income","passive income ideas","credit card"],"title":"My Tenant Just Moved Out | The Aftermath","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HDsWJnHTcQg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HDsWJnHTcQg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HDsWJnHTcQg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HDsWJnHTcQg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HDsWJnHTcQg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT12M36S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4819","dislikeCount":"798","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"48711","viewCount":"1141762"}},{"id":"VG5AGO_2AYs","snippet":{"description":"Lets go over the Top 5 BEST Credit Cards for Millennials - Enjoy!

A BIG reason this card is PERFECT for millennials is because it\u2019ll offer you 5% cash back on revolving categories throughout the year. For the first 12 months, they will MATCH your cash back with NO MINIMUMS. \n\nSECOND: The Capital One Savor Card\nNext, we\u2019re going to step it up just a little bit depending on how you spend your money\u2026and also, for anyone who wants a \u201cfree\u201d $300 for doing 10 minutes of work\u2026this is it: The Capital One Savor Card\nNow, what makes this card pretty appealing is that - first, they\u2019ll offer you a $300 cash bonus when you spend $3000 on the card in the first 3 months (some links offer $150 but with 3x points for dining)\n\nIn addition to the sign up bonus, though, you\u2019ve also got UNLIMITED 3-4% cash back on dining and entertainment, 2% cash back at grocery stores, and 1% back on everything else. Plus, no foreign transaction fees\u2026\n\nTHIRD: Amazon Prime Card\nFirst, just for signing up - they\u2019ll give you a $100 Amazon Gift Card. Then, when you pay for your purchase with this card, you\u2019ll automatically get 5% off of your Amazon order. In addition to that, this card will also give you 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores\u2026and then 1% cash back on all other purchases. Now, even though there\u2019s $0 annual fee\u2026in order to get the 5% cash back on purchases, you\u2019ll need an Amazon Prime Membership, which will run you $119 per year. \n\nFOURTH: \nAmerican Express Gold Card\nTo begin, there\u2019s a bonus out there - somewhere - if you look hard enough, that will give you 50,000 points when you sign up for the card and spend $2000 in the first 3 months: \nhttps:\/\/www.uscreditcardguide.com\/amex-premier-rewards-gold-card\/\n\nFor these points, I redeem them through Aeroplan to get free travel. \nIn addition to that, you\u2019ll be getting a $120 per year DINING CREDIT.\nYou\u2019ll ALSO get a $100 airline credit every year. \nNot to mention, you\u2019ll get 4x points when you spend your card on dining, 4x points when you spend your card at supermarkets, and 3x points when you spend any money on travel. \nThe downside, UNFORTUNATELY - is that this card comes with an annual fee of $250 per year. BUT\u2026from my experience, that annual fee pays for itself sooooo many times over if you utilize this card for travel and you take advantage of all the features this card has to offer. \n\nFIFTH: Chase Sapphire Reserve\nTo start, you\u2019ll get a 50,000 point sign up bonus when you spend $4000 in the first 3 months. That\u2019s a $750 value when redeemed for travel through Chase. In addition to that, you\u2019ll get a $300 annual travel credit\u2026which, to me, is a HUGE advantage of getting this card. You\u2019ll also get complimentary Priority Pass Lounge Access, which is another $95 per year value.You\u2019ll also get a $100 credit towards TSA Pre-check or Global Entry, meaning that you can get through the lines THAT much faster anytime you\u2019re going somewhere. Tthere IS an annual fee of $450\u2026but it\u2019s worth it for all the perks. \n\nHONORARY MENTIONS:\nUber Visa Card (No annual fee, $100 uber cash + 5% cash back on Uber): https:\/\/www.uber.com\/us\/en\/money\/uber-credit-card\/\nCiti DoubleCash Credit Car (No annual fee, 2% cash back everything)\n\nAnd, being a millennial\u2026it\u2019s our duty to spend responsibly, put it on credit cards, pay it off in full each month, get rewards\u2026and smash the like button for the youtube algorithm. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\nSome of the card links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

That\u2019s been the cumulation of almost 3 years, posting 3 videos per week, and now that I have a backlog of over 400 videos posted on YouTube, the residual views and income has been pretty high. Just for context, when I started\u2026making $1 in a day was really, really good\u2026.so it\u2019s kinda to see how far this has come. \n\nMy Second Channel - The Graham Stephan Show\nThis was the channel I started in May of 2019 as a way for me to make \u201cExtra\u201d content, spin off a slightly different format, and have a more casual approach to personal finance, investing, and saving money. This channel is a mix between answering financial related questions from viewers, ranting about whatever I find interesting, and\u2026the popular series everyone just wants more of\u2026reacting to Millennial Money. I\u2019m posting on this channel 4x per week, which is a LOT\u2026but since the content isn\u2019t planned out, at all, it\u2019s an easy format to post at a much higher rate\u2026and this is how much that makes. \n\nProgram Sales:\nFor those that aren\u2019t aware, I have two programs that I created - one is called The Real Estate Agent Academy, which teaches people how to grow their career as a real estate agent, and the other is The YouTube Creator Academy - which teaches people how to grow their YouTube channel. I rarely ever advertise it because I don\u2019t want to be annoying or be grouped together with the \u201cyoutube guru\u201d crowd, so I mostly just link it in the description - and that typically leads to a few sales per day.\n\nAmazon Affiliates: \nIf people use your link to buy something - you get a small \u201ccommission.\u201d And since people always ask me about which camera equipment I use, or what books I recommend\u2026I figured, I\u2019d just set up an Amazon Affiliate store so they can buy it directly. This store is linked in the descriptions of my videos, and if people are interested - they\u2019ll use it. \n\nAcorns Referrals:  https:\/\/acorns.com\/invite\/GK4CWW\nI made a video reviewing my HONEST, UNBIASED thoughts on the investment app, Acorns.

I was left with a half finished, template website that was never fully functional\u2026designs for business cards and letterheads I never actually used, because I wasn\u2019t entirely happy with them\u2026and a $5000 lesson that I should NEVER be pressured into buying something I didn\u2019t entirely need. \n\n#2: A $1200 Tailored Suit\nThis happened when I was 20 years old and I felt like I needed to buy myself an \u201cADULT\u201d suit for important meetings and formal occasions\u2026I just went to the first \u201cHigh End\u201d suit place I could find and I trusted the salesman to give me the BEST suit he possible could for the price. But, instead\u2026I got suit that looked like my Grandpa owned it. I tried to take it to ANOTHER tailor to fix it, but because the entire shape of the suit was so off-proportioned, it would cost more money than what it was worth - so I never wore it. \n\n#3 HIRING A CHEAP LANDSCAPER\nI hired the cheapest bid for the job because it seemed like I was getting a great deal. However, the landscaper had no idea what he was doing - wasn\u2019t showing up on time - left early - and left the job half completed. It was in such disrepair that I had to have it re done correctly by someone else. I should\u2019ve been supervising the job much more closely from the very beginning instead of trusting the CHEAPEST person to do the work. Second, I should\u2019ve been WAY more specific of my expectations, the work that needed to be done, and then outline deadline to make sure it was done on time. And third, as soon as I noticed something was wrong - I should\u2019ve cut my losses and moved on to someone else. \n\n#4: GETTING CAUGHT IN HYPE\nI can\u2019t mention this word specifically because, for some reason, it impacts the algorithm - but it starts with a b and ends in coin. And that type of digital currency. I bought into a specific coin that went up in value a LOT within the first week, and I didn\u2019t sell because I got greedy. In hindsight, I don\u2019t regret buying into the hype\u2026to me, it was the same as spending money with friends at a casino in terms of what I expected from it. BUT, I DO regret being so care-free about it - and I DO regret the greed that took over when I felt like I could inch out a little more profit. \n\n#5 BUYING TOO CHEAP \nThat\u2019s just being too cheap where it matters the most. When that happens, it just costs me WAY more money than than had I just spent more upfront on something that WASN\u2019T so cheap. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at\u2026I could\u2019ve saved a LOT of money doing things the RIGHT way, the FIRST time\u2026instead of being too cheap upfront, and then spending MORE money in the long run. This can apply to just about ANYTHING out there, and even now..I still find myself making the same mistake here and there. I\u2019m doing BETTER\u2026but there\u2019s something way too appealing about saving as much money as possible, that I get caught in the excitement of saving pennies\u2026while walking over dollars. \n\nSo there you have it\u2026my dumbest financial purchases in my 20\u2019s\u2026.SO FAR. I\u2019m definitely not proud of some of this, but at the very least\u2026if you can learn something from it, and not do what I did\u2026then it was all worth it. Because everything I mentioned could\u2019ve easily been avoided with a little upfront research, a little more planning, and realizing that spending more money UPFRONT - can often SAVE you MORE money, long term. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s taken me WAY too long to realize. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-12-04T23:30:00Z","tags":["dumbest purchases","dumbest purchases in my 20s","how to invest","how to invest in your 20s","investing","investing 101","investing in your 20s","robinhood","robinhood app","credit score","credit score explained","how to increase your credit score","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","real estate investing","real estate investing for beginners","investing for beginners","how to save money","financial mistakes"],"title":"The 5 Dumbest Purchases I\u2019ve Made In My 20\u2019s","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Gxdi66IXi0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Gxdi66IXi0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Gxdi66IXi0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Gxdi66IXi0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/8Gxdi66IXi0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M43S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"1737","dislikeCount":"595","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"35345","viewCount":"641344"}},{"id":"dnEp0othmv0","snippet":{"description":"Lets discuss 7 ways you can invest $10,000 in 2021 - and how you can best maximize your money, enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy: \nLearn EXACTLY how to grow an audience, rank videos on the front page of searches, build your brand, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1000): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nMy second channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/thegrahamstephanshow\n\nFIRST: Use some of that money towards an Emergency Fund\nThis the money you set aside to ONLY be used in case of\u2026YOU GUESSED IT\u2026. an emergency, where you have no other option to turn. Ideally, the size of this fund should equal anywhere from 3-6 months worth of your expenses, and kept easily accessible\u2026.for emergencies. Lets say you lose a job, your car breaks down, or some other \u201cemergency\u201d happens and you need money\u2026this is where you get it from. \n\nSECOND: Pay down high interest rate debt\nWhen you have high interest rate debt\u2026paying DOWN that debt is like getting a guaranteed return on your money at whatever interest rate you\u2019re paying down. So paying off a 20% interest credit card balance is like getting an immediate, guaranteed 20% return on your money - without ANY risk whatsoever. \n\nTHIRD: Retirement accounts\n-Roth IRA\nThis is a retirement account where you can contribute and invest after-tax money, and then all of the profit within that account is COMPLETELY tax free after the age of 59.5. You\u2019re able to open up one of these accounts and deposit up to $6000 PER YEAR if you\u2019re under the age of 50\u2026and if you\u2019re over 50, you can contribute $7000 per year. \n-Traditional 401K\nThis is an account that you invest PRE-TAX money into, and then you\u2019re taxed when you begin withdrawing the money after the age of 59.5. Now, unfortunately, the \u201ccatch\u201d here is that you end up paying taxes when you take the money OUT of the account in retirement\u2026so it\u2019s not exactly a \u201cTax free\u201d investment.\n-HSA Health Savings Account\nThis account is specifically used to pay any out of pocket medical expenses or charges that you incur\u2026if you don\u2019t use them one year, that\u2019s fine, it all rolls over to the next year. \n\nFOURTH: Low Risk Low Reward: High Interest Savings Account, CD, Bonds\nFirst, a savings account is the most obvious choice - and there\u2019s no shortage of high interest, online savings accounts that\u2019ll pay you above 1.7% annually. \nhttps:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/banking\/savings\/rates\/\nSecond, if you KNOW for sure you won\u2019t be needing the money for a specific amount of time - you could look into putting your money into a CD, which will give you a slightly higher return while you continue saving. \nAnd third\u2026if you want to take a little more risk with your money, but still keep it fairly safe\u2026we have Bonds. \nA bond is basically just an IOU from a government, state, city, business\u2026and again, most bonds are relatively safe.\n\nFIFTH: Index Funds\nAn index fund is basically just an investment that tracks the overall market, and you\u2019ll get to own a small amount of everything in one fund, for a low price. For MOST people watching this video\u2026I\u2019d probably recommend this route, because it\u2019ll be your best risk vs reward in terms of how much money you\u2019ll be making. \n\nSIXTH: Individual Stocks\nThis is, by far - the riskiest from everything I\u2019ve discussed - but, the payout potential could be much larger. This is because you\u2019re placing a significant portion of your money within only a few specific companies, and your entire investment is dependent on those businesses doing well\u2026so if you have a knack for picking stocks, and NOT trading emotionally\u2026then it may work out for you. \n\nSEVENTH: Real Estate\nYou could potentially buy a property up to $100,000 or so, and then rent it out. That could make you money in so many different ways, not to mention the tax benefits you\u2019ll get of being able to write off all of your expenses, the equity you\u2019ll gain by paying down the mortgage, and the potential appreciation of the building over time. All of which could increase your overall return dramatically. \n\n*Not Financial Advice ;) \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2019-12-02T23:30:00Z","tags":["HOW TO INVEST","how to invest 100","how to invest 500","how to invest 1000","how to invest 10000","investing 101","investing for beginners","investing in stocks","investing in real estate","how to improve your credit score","credit score increase","credit score explained","robinhood","robinhood app","how to make money","how to build wealth","how to build wealth in your 20s","how to invest in your 20s","how to be a millionaire","how to make passive income","passive income"],"title":"7 Ways To Invest $10,000 In 2021","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dnEp0othmv0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dnEp0othmv0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dnEp0othmv0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dnEp0othmv0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dnEp0othmv0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT19M39S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"4149","dislikeCount":"870","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"32504","viewCount":"662592"}},{"id":"xJvkaok4AF4","snippet":{"description":"Lets talk about the recent stock market valuation of Tesla, the stock price, and whether or not it\u2019s overvalued - enjoy!

YES, I bought Tesla stock awhile ago at $260 a share, and YES I\u2019m still holding on to it. \n\nBut, what about Tesla, and current price TODAY\u2026is it REALLY worth what it\u2019s trading at?\n\nIf you\u2019re PESSIMISTIC on Tesla, you\u2019ve got quite a few arguments to back up your reasoning:\n\nOne, at this level, Tesla is valued at MORE than Ford, GM, and Chrysler\u2026COMBINED. And that could be concerning when you consider that Tesla only delivers a FRACTION of the cars that nearly every other automaker produces. \nhttps:\/\/wolfstreet.com\/2020\/01\/24\/tesla-global-deliveries-compared-to-top-10-volkswagen-toyota-gm-ford-honda-fca-mercedes-chart\/\n\nSecond, Tesla shares are trading at 85 times the projected $1.4 Billion Dollars of earnings in 2020\u2026and, again, when you compare that to ANY other automaker\u2026it\u2019s A LOT. \nhttps:\/\/www.gurufocus.com\/term\/pettm\/VWAGY\/PE-Ratiottm\/Volkswagen-AG\n\nThird, Tesla has only barely turned a profit\u2026and even though things are OPTIMISTIC, there isn\u2019t enough history behind the company to guarantee that this will continue, and demand will continue, for the foreseeable future and beyond. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/01\/29\/business\/tesla-earnings\/index.html\n\nFourth\u2026.Tesla is expected to face more and more competition from automakers who want to take away marketshare. And automakers all agree\u2026electric cars are going to be the future, so they\u2019re sinking a LOT of money into EV development. \n\nThat might cause one to believe that\u2026based on quite a few factors\u2026Tesla is OVERVALUED, and to reach a valuation similar to other automakers, Tesla would have to continue posting many years of 50% year over year growth in order to \u201cGrow Into\u201d what it is today. \n\nHowever, the people who are OPTIMISTIC about Tesla would argue entirely differently - and would see it as UNDERVALUED. \n\nTesla focused on the technology - Their proprietary technology is why Tesla gets significantly more range than other, competing car companies\u2026and not only that, but Tesla\u2019s batteries are less expensive to manufacture, which would lead them to even further profit. \n\nSecond, one can argue that Electric Vehicles would be a similar adoption to that of the internet, or smartphones, or even the television when it first came out\u2026and this follows an S-Curve of growth. \n\nThird, Tesla is expanding with no stop in sight. They\u2019re pushing out even more cars, they\u2019re coming out with new concepts, and they\u2019re expanding their manufacturing over the next few years. They\u2019re also one of the few car manufacturers to post consistent growth in this space, while every other automaker has largely \u201cFailed\u201d at producing their own electric car. \n\nFourth, arguably\u2026Tesla can move pretty quickly. It doesn\u2019t seem as though they have a chain of command like other companies - instead, it\u2019s Elon Musk and his crazy visions - and then, people just make it happen. \n\nAnd finally\u2026from my own, anecdotal experience\u2026Tesla is a good product, and I didn\u2019t fully \u201cunderstand it\u201d until I bought one. \n\nAnd my thoughts, as far as where we\u2019re at right now\u2026even as a Tesla owner and stock holder\u2026I can\u2019t help but think a lot of this recent value is pushed more so by hysteria and excitement over making money, than it is about the prospect of Tesla overtaking the planet.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not to say that Tesla doesn\u2019t have INCREDIBLE technology\u2026and there are a LOT of promising features to come in the near future, like full self driving\u2026or, maybe one day, autonomous Tesla Model 3 taxis. But right now\u2026I think there\u2019s still quite a few things that will need to happen, first, before we get there. \n\nBut who knows\u2026maybe one day, we\u2019ll all be driving Teslas\u2026on the moon. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The most notable of this is that they\u2019ll be able to see if your spending habits have been steadily INCREASING, if your account balances are getting higher every month, or how often you\u2019ve been maxing out your accounts. \n\nSecond, the new FICO scoring method will be able to see if your credit usage is INCREASING over time. \nThis new scoring method will weigh personal loans much more heavily, and that would likely bring down your score. This new scoring method will also be able to calculate if your debt is INCREASING over time, or if the amounts owed are steadily going up - and lenders would be able to take that into consideration to determine whether or not you\u2019re a potential risk. \n\nThird, on a GOOD note, FICO actually made an IMPROVEMENT to the credit scoring system, and they won\u2019t be penalizing you for TEMPORARILY maxing out your account or holding a one time high balance. \nThey\u2019re going to analyze the last 24 months of your account history, and any sudden \u201cblips\u201d of high spending won\u2019t count against you, like if you had a big one-time purchases, or happened to make a lot of charges around a single time .\n\nNow, in terms of what you could do about it:\n\nFIRST: Always pay off your credit cards in full by the time they\u2019re due. \nNothing changes here - I\u2019ve been saying this before, and I\u2019ll continue saying it - credit cards should not be seen as a way to borrow money. Instead, you should always opt to put normal spending on the card and use credit as a buffer between your spending, and your actual money.\n\nSECOND: Don\u2019t be afraid to take out MORE CREDIT\nI know this sounds completely counter-intuitive\u2026but, when lenders want to see a consistently small outstanding account balance - it HELPS to have more credit available to you, even if you aren\u2019t using it. This is because, like I mentioned, 30% of your credit score is calculated from \u201camounts owed,\u201d which is your utilization rate\u2026and the higher the percentage is, the lower your score. \n\nAND THIRD: I think this goes without saying\u2026don\u2019t take out personal loans and then rack up more debt on credit cards. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And this book gives you the EXACT strategies and blueprint to think like someone who makes millions of dollars and achieves whatever they set out to do. \n\nSECOND: A Coffee Maker\nThe sad reality is that, according to the investment app Acorns, 1\/3rd of American spend more on Coffee than on Retirement. \nhttps:\/\/www.fool.com\/retirement\/2018\/01\/22\/one-third-of-americans-spend-more-on-coffee-than-o.aspx\n\nNot to mention, people between the ages of 25-34 spend an average of over $2000 per year on this deliciously amazing drink\nhttps:\/\/sprudge.com\/how-much-do-you-spend-on-coffee-each-year-136082.html\n\nFor someone who goes and gets a $3 cup of Starbucks coffee every morning\u2026spending $35 on your own coffee maker would pay for itself in LESS THAN 2 WEEKS\u2026and then everything else after that is profit. \n\nTHIRD: A crock pot. \nAll you need to do is throw in some meat and vegetables, and then forget about it until later\u2026then afterwards, you\u2019re going to get a really delicious home made meal, for a fraction of the price of eating out at a restaurant. Even if this doing this just saves you $5 per meal instead of grabbing food on the way home\u2026your total cost of the crockpot PLUS ingredients should end up paying fo itself within less than 2 weeks\u2026then, everything else after that is pure savings.\n\nFOURTH: Rechargeable Batteries\nThese can be expensive! For a little more, you can get a whole bunch of rechargeable batteries and NEVER have to replace them, ever again. \n\nFIFTH: A Reusable Water Bottle\nJust setting yourself up with this ONCE should, ideally, pay for itself relatively quickly if you\u2019re the type who would otherwise buy water bottles, or buy a drink when you\u2019re out.\n\nSIXTH: A reliable, used car\nIn terms of making and saving money - going with a vehicle that\u2019s already seen the majority of its depreciation can be a great way to cut back on your expenses, and drive a car without losing much money. \n\nSEVENTH: A DashCam\nThis is installed to the front of your car that continuously records footage in the event something happens. Chances are\u2026hopefully\u2026you\u2019ll never need to use it. But, the $50-$100 you spend on this is almost like an insurance IF anything happens, and you need PROOF to back up your claims to an insurance company. \n\nEIGTH: The Stock Market\nThis is where you can invest in a small ownership of a particular company, or groups of companies\u2026and as their value goes up, so does your profit. In addition to that, many stocks pay what\u2019s called \u2018Dividends\u2019 - this is when they pay YOU every quarter for owning their stock, depending on the profits of the company. \n\nNINTH: Real Estate\nThe way I see it, is that we all need a place to live - and, if your strategic about it\u2026you can find a way for this to pay for itself. One of the ways I do this is by what\u2019s called \u201cHouse hacking.\u201d This is where you buy a multi-family property with 2 to 4 units, you move into one of the units, and then you rent the others to cover your cost of living. If done correctly, you should be able to break even on the property without coming out of pocket\u2026thereby, \u201cliving for free.\u201d \n\nTENTH: Education. \nThis could be in the form of buying a book, watching countless hours of YouTube like I do, going to an event to network, or buying yourself ANYTHING to improve your skills. All of these have the potential to yield a 100x return on what you spend, in terms of your future earning potential. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan Get 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:  \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nNow, in terms of the actual driving and ownership experience\u2026here\u2019s the \u201cBad\u201d\n\nThe first is with Super Charging. \nThankfully, I have yet to be in a situation where I\u2019ve arrived at a Super Charger and it\u2019s been entirely full. However, I\u2019ve certainly been in situations where I\u2019ve pulled up to a supercharger and taken the last spot\u2026and then someone pulls up a few minutes later and has to sit there, waiting for 10-20 minutes waiting for something to open up.\n\nSecond, lets talk briefly about Range Anxiety. \nThis is the phenomenon where you worry about running out of a charge while driving, or wondering about whether or not you\u2019ll have enough electricity to make it to your destination and back without running out. \n\nAnd third\u2026while we\u2019re on the topic of super chargers\u2026it definitely adds time to your trip. \nThe car will tell you that you\u2019ll only have to supercharge for 10 or 20 minutes in order to give yourself enough battery to get to the next supercharger\u2026but usually you never want to cut it that close, and the mileage the car tells you can be off by 5 or 10%.\n\nFourth: Entry \nI\u2019ve noticed that at completely random times, when I walk up to the car\u2026it won\u2019t open. \n\nFifth: Repair\nIt\u2019s been decent the ONE TIME I\u2019ve used it. They DID fix the car and they gave me a Model X P90D as a loaner car, which was REALLY nice. Plus, I\u2019ve heard that Tesla will often will you a BETTER LOANER CAR than what you currently drive, just to give you a bonus \u201cTesla experience\u201d and show you what you\u2019re missing out on.\n\nSixth: Paying extra for Full Self Driving\nI probably would\u2019ve been a little upset had I paid $5000 for the full self driving option a year ago, and still not have been able to use it like initially advertised. \n\nWhat I like:\n\nFirst\u2026Autopilot. It\u2019s absolutely amazing. \nAfter using it\u2026I gotta say\u2026the self driving feature is a better driver than 99% of people on the road. It keeps the car RIGHT in the middle of the lane, it\u2019s avoided accidents from cars who have tried to merge into me, it keeps me going at the precise speed I set it to, and it makes the overall trip SO much more enjoyable. \n\nSecond, there\u2019s absolutely something to be said about not having a gas powered engine. \nThat means I never need to stop at gas stations. I never need to worry about oil changes. Plus, electricity is WAY cheaper than gasoline, so it ends up saving me a ton of money. \n\nThird: Tesla Car Insurance\nBecause Tesla understands how to fix their own cars, and fully understands their accident-avoidance capabilities\u2026so they\u2019ll insure it FOR YOU, for a fraction of the price. \n\nFourth: Ample Storage\nIt\u2019s got a front trunk which is big enough for a small suitcase or a few bags of groceries. And then you have a massive back trunk\u2026which turns into an even more massive trunk when you put down the back seats.\n\nFifth: The Tesla App\nIn here, you can set the car to begin heating before you even arrive\u2026The app also allows you to lock or unlock your car remotely, anywhere in the world\u2026Not to mention, for people like me who lose their car really, really easily because they forget where it\u2019s parked\u2026well, the app literally tells you where your car is located, and it\u2019ll map you to its precise location. \n\nSixth: The center screen also turns into a TV in the event you want to watch YouTube, Netflix, or Hulu\u2026\n\nAnd when it comes down to it, driving and owning a Tesla is very much an \u201cexperience,\u201d Once you get it, it\u2019s hard to look at cars the same way, ever again. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

When you\u2019re young, one of the BIGGEST advantages you have when it comes to investing is really simple...it\u2019s just TIME. Not only can you ride out any short term fluctuations in the market, but you can take full advantage of what\u2019s called COMPOUND INTEREST. Every year that goes by without investing, is a year you won\u2019t be seeing iNSANE growth 30 or 40 years from now. \n\nNUMBER TWO: DON\u2019T TIME THE MARKET\nThis is the SIMPLEST, most FACTUAL piece of advice you\u2019ll EVER hear when it comes to investing\u2026but it also happens to be the most difficult for people to actually follow. \n\nStudies Here: \nhttps:\/\/www.putnam.com\/literature\/pdf\/II508-ac37f7ad02b2d8889f7e5361f0e8ac86.pdf\n\nAnd another study shows that, generally speaking, the more trades you make, and the more you try to time the market, the lower your overall return becomes.\nhttps:\/\/finpage.blog\/2014\/09\/18\/the-evidence-against-market-timing\/\n\nOn the other hand\u2026research has also shown that since 1926, a 20-year holding period of the stock market has never ONCE produced a negative result\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/stocks\/08\/passive-active-investing.asp\n\nSo without over loading you with facts and studies, all I\u2019m going to say is this: The buy and hold investment strategy tends to not only be the safest, but also the most profitable for the majority of people. In fact, just buying in the market IMMEDIATELY - regardless of where its priced - has out performed trying to time the market 71% of the time\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.wallstreetphysician.com\/traders-underperform-market\/\n\nNUMBER THREE: DON\u2019T INVEST IN THINGS YOU DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND\nI\u2019d MUCH rather you just NOT invest at all, than put your money into something you don\u2019t fully understand. Especially in this market, where literally EVERYTHING is going up\u2026it\u2019s so simple to get disillusioned that investing is really easy, and get yourself accustomed to ALWAYS making money. But that doesn\u2019t always happen. You need to understand that investing is going to be cyclical, investments will LOSE for years in a row\u2026and you need to understand and know that going in. \n\nFOURTH: DON\u2019T INVEST MONEY YOU NEED IN THE SHORT TERM\nWhen you invest money, there\u2019s ALWAYS a chance that the value of that investment will go down in the near future. Investing should always be seen as a LONG TERM strategy. You generally can\u2019t predict where the markets will be a few months or a few years from now - but, you CAN look back historically - and see that over a period of 10 or 20 years, your chances of coming out ahead profitable are pretty good. So, for that reason\u2026investing any money that you\u2019ll need within the short term is NOT a good idea, and could cost you a LOT if things end up getting bad. \n\nFIFTH: INVEST CONSISTENTLY\nInvesting is just a way of life. All you need to do this, is to AUTOMATE your investing as much as you can. Just setup automatic withdrawals into a broad index fund without even thinking about it - out of sight, out of mind. You don\u2019t need to be actively involved with it all the time, but just consciously remember it\u2019s there - and that\u2019s it. \n\nSIXTH: THINK INDEPENDENTLY\nThis is the hardest thing to do from everything I\u2019ve mentioned, but it\u2019s also the one that will make you the most money if you get good at it. And what I mean by this is that you MUST trust your own thoughts and research, and NOT be swayed by someone else who says otherwise, or disagrees with you. \n\nSo, it\u2019s really from those 6 habits that I\u2019ve formed my ENTIRE investing career\u2026in fact, I can\u2019t think of a single investment I\u2019ve made without considering each and every one of these points I\u2019ve just discussed. Just follow this, stick with it\u2026smash the like button\u2026and you\u2019ll be set. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan \n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:  \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nI thought this would be a fun video, to go back to the basics and cover EVERY technique I\u2019ve used that\u2019s allowed me to save almost 100% of my income and essentially \u201cLive For Free\u201d. \n\nFIRST: LIVING FOR FREE\nThis is when you buy a multi-family home - like a duplex, triplex, or fourplex\u2026then LIVE in one of the units, and rent the others house to cover your cost. You could also buy a single family home with a detached guest house, or maybe with a basement that you rent out to cover your overhead. Typically, when done right\u2026the rental income from the other units will cover your entire cost of owning the building - and when that happens - you\u2019ve essentially got a free place to stay. VIDEO HERE: https:\/\/youtu.be\/smvvTw5GhyM\n\nSECOND: DRIVING FOR FREE\nThere ARE cars out there that you can buy, under market value, at the bottom of their depreciation curve\u2026that don\u2019t lose much value during the time that you drive it. For example, MANY used cars reach this point after about 5 or 6 years where the depreciation levels off, allowing you to use it without costing you a lot of money. Then, at the very least - the only out of pocket cost would be insurance, maintenance, and gas\u2026which, if you find yourself a reliable car, and don\u2019t get speeding tickets\u2026it shouldn\u2019t be much money.\n\nTHIRD: TRAVEL FOR FREE\nCredit card companies will offer incredible bonuses JUST for signing up for their credit card. People who understand the art of how the system works, can use this to their advantage by signing up for said credit card, meeting the minimum requirements to get the bonus...then GET the bonus, redeem that for all types of free travel, and then move on to the next card and repeat the process again. \n\nFirst, obviously, you should NEVER do this is you have no idea how to properly handle a credit card.\n\nSecond, NEVER pay a SINGLE DIME IN INTEREST. So lets make it clear: you won\u2019t owe ANY interest when you pay off the card in full, when it\u2019s due.\n\nThird, DO NOT DO THIS if you\u2019re about to get a loan for a house, or a car.\n\nBut if you can follow the above few steps and do your research about the best credit card reward bonuses to get\u2026doing this can be a fun hobby that\u2019ll end up making you a LOT of money in free travel, rewards, and perks - and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been able to cut my travel expenses down to $0. \n\nFOURTH: MAKE COFFEE AT HOME\nIf making coffee at home means that you can save just $15 per week on coffee\u2026that works out to be a savings of $780 per year. And if you JUST invested that money every year, instead, in an SP500 index fund within a Roth IRA, earning an average of a 7% interest rate with dividends re-invested\u2026over 40 years, you will have accumulated over $178,295.54. Thanks to Trade Coffee for sponsoring this video :)\n\nFIFTH: EATING AT RESTAURANTS\nInstead of going out to eat somewhere\u2026it\u2019s REALLY simple to go to the grocery store, spend $7, and make a restaurant-quality meal yourself, at a fraction of the price.\n\nSIXTH: GET FREE PARKING\nI just don\u2019t see the point in spending $5 to $10 to park in a parking lot, when I could park a block away - for free - and walk to where I\u2019m going, instead. To me, that\u2019s like I\u2019m getting PAID just to get a little exercise\u2026and it saves me money. \n\nSEVENTH: TRACK YOUR EXPENSES\nThis is like the glue that holds everything together, because without knowing how much you spend\u2026you won\u2019t know how much money you\u2019ll need to sustain your lifestyle, and you won\u2019t be able to effectively cut back on the things that aren\u2019t really bringing you much value. Doing this is really, really simple\u2026I use the websites Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com, which automatically keep a thorough report of how much you make, how much you spend, and where you spend it. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And for the majority of the people on the platform, that\u2019s just a drop in the bucket from how much money they can make.  \n\nAlmost EVERY YouTuber you see on the platform makes money from what\u2019s called Google Adsense. Ad rates can be impacted by the time of the year, how long the video is, the watch time of that video, and whether or not the video contains multiple mid-roll ads versus just one 5-second ad in the very beginning. Now, in terms of HOW MUCH they actually make\u2026if they make generic, non-specific \u201cfamily friendly\u201d content that isn\u2019t targeted around one specific audience\u2026on the low end, they can make about $2-$3 per 1000 views. \n\nNow, in terms of how much money I make as a channel with 1 million subscribers\u2026last month, I received almost 7.8 million views and my take-home from that was $129,122.99 in ad revenue. \n\nAnother common way to make money is through Sponsorships. This ranges, but with over 1 million subscribers, Sponsors will often pay $4000 - $20,000+ or higher depending on the deal. So, as you can see\u2026the amount a YouTuber can make really starts to add up, especially if every one of their videos is sponsored. \n\nNot to mention - Merch Sales. Some of the larger YouTube merch lines do EXCEPTIONALLY well. They have a recognizable brand, they have a variety of products, and they continually cycle through limited-edition merch to keep you buying\u2026and they can make a LOT of money from that.  \n\nThey also have Affiliate Marketing to make Passive Income \nThis is when they promote a service or a company that isn\u2019t theirs, BUT, they get a commission every time someone signs up or buys something. \n\nYou can also sell a program or education, as well. \nI have two programs that I created - one is called The Real Estate Agent Academy, which teaches people how to grow their career as a real estate agent, and the other is The YouTube Creator Academy - which teaches people how to grow their YouTube channel and turn it into a business. \n\nAnd, lastly, YouTubers might have a MEMBERSHIP Site where they charge a monthly fee for Bonus Content.\n\nHow much a YouTuber makes is entirely dependent on how well they run it like a business - and the number of subscribers doesn\u2019t have a DIRECT correlation as to how much money that person is actually making. The YouTubers who ARE business savvy - who DO find a way to branch off and create additional sources of revenue - can make a SIGNIFICANT amount of money. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Enjoy!

Except as of today, they\u2019re ADDING features to the card\u2026and then CHARGING you $100 MORE than you were already paying, for the privilege of hopefully using them. \n\nIf you ALREADY have the Chase Sapphire Reserve, and your renewal date is prior to April 1st 2020\u2026then, not to worry. Your card is going to renew at the normal $450 annual fee, AND you\u2019ll still get to use all the new benefits of the card for the following 12 months. \n\nHowever, if your renewal comes up on April 1st or LATER\u2026well\u2026you\u2019re stuck paying the new $550 annual fee. \nhttps:\/\/thepointsguy.com\/news\/significant-changes-confirmed-for-chases-sapphire-reserve-card\/\n\nBut, in terms of what you GET for that extra $100\u2026here is what it is:\n\nFirst, they\u2019re going to be giving you a $60 Statement Credit for DoorDash in 2020, and then another $60 again in 2021\u2026which COULD be a decent feature\u2026IF you actually use it. You\u2019ll also get another perk that comes included\u2026and that would be 1 year of Free DashPass - which otherwise costs $10 per month. With this, you\u2019ll get free delivery on purchases over $10.\nhttps:\/\/www.doordash.com\/dashpass\/\n\nSecond, the Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit Card will be giving you one year of free Lyft Pink:\nWith this, you\u2019ll receive 15% off your Lyft Rides, you won\u2019t get a cancellation fee if you cancel within the first 15 minutes, up to 3 cancellations per month, you\u2019ll also get priority dispatch at airports, Lost Item Fee Protection, and 3 Free Scooter Rides up to 30 minutes per month\u2026for a limited time. \n\nIn addition to that, the Chase Sapphire Reserve will give you 10x POINTS on all Lyft Charges. That means that - at worst - if each point is worth 1.5 cents, getting 10x points back would be the equivalent of you getting an additional 15% back on Lyft Charges. So, the way I see it, is that if you spend $300 or more on Lyft each year\u2026the $100 annual fee increase would be a break even, and then everything else becomes profit.\n\nFor ME\u2026I doubt I\u2019ll be keeping the card by the time my renewal comes up later this year. I don\u2019t use DoorDash, GrubHub, UberEats, or Postmates\u2026out of principle, I just don\u2019t like paying more than I need to for food, and if I can make food at home\u2026I go that route.\n\nThe same also applies to Lyft. Even though a 30% discount in pricing is SUBSTANTIAL, and that\u2019ll ensure that almost EVERY Chase Sapphire Reserve customer uses Lyft instead of Uber\u2026you need to be someone who actually uses the service often for it to be worth it. And admittedly, even though my American Express Platinum gives you a $200 statement credit annually towards Uber\u2026a lot of that just goes to waste. So, I\u2019d expect the same to happen with this\u2026it\u2019s a good benefit, just not for me, and I don\u2019t want to pay for something I wouldn\u2019t use. \n\nSo, my plan is to keep this card and use the features until my annual fee comes up\u2026and then, at that point, it\u2019s time to say Good Bye. In it\u2019s replacement, I\u2019m still keeping my JP Morgan Reserve Card\u2026which is pretty much the same thing, ANYWAY\u2026and my American Express Platinum covers anything else I might want. So, there\u2019s no more sense keeping this one around longer than I need to. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

By the time I took it over, the unit was in pretty much original condition - which is basically another word for: it\u2019s a disaster and needs a lot of work. \n\nWell, those tenants ended up moving out a month ago - and that left me with a unit that needed a complete overhaul. Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t as simple as just replacing carpet and slapping some paint on the walls and then calling it a day\u2026\n\nThis unit is located in a fairly desirable part of Los Angeles, so in order to get top dollar - it needs to be done up all the way, and done correctly. Plus, in order to do that - this unit needed the floorpan re-arranged, it needed another bathroom added, it needed ceilings replaced, and it needed an entirely new kitchen, etc. \n\n\nSo, with that\u2026about 2.5 weeks ago, we started demolishing the unit, tearing out the walls, and seeing what was behind. \n\nBut as we got behind the walls, I began realizing that things would cost just a little more than anticipated\u2026\n\nNow, keep in mind - initially, I set my remodeling budget around $65,000 - just KNOWING that it was going to be more like $85,000 by the time it\u2019s done. Because now, after doing 5 renovations\u2026I just assume it\u2019s ALWAYS going to cost more than I think, and it\u2019s going to take LONGER than I expect it to\u2026\n\nAlthough this one, I admit\u2026I underestimated, a bit too much. Even at my final $85,000 estimate\u2026 I was still off. \n\nThese are the details about the home renovation, my expected return on investment, and other questions you have asked for :) \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Invest in what you know \u2014 and have a vision for it.\u201d\n\nSECOND: According to Gary Vee - Flip Items \nGo on craigslist, find items in the free section, go to garage sales, get a good deal on something you can re-sell\u2026then, sell it for a profit, and re-invest those earnings back into flipping something else. \n\nTHIRD: According to Grant Cardone - Improve and invest in yourself\nHis advice was to spend $100 re-investing back into yourself in the form of a book or a course\u2026and ends it with \u201cWhatever you invest in yourself, you can\u2019t lose.\u201d\n\nFOURTH: According to Dan Lok - Learn a high-income skill\nINVEST IN YOURSELF and learn a skill that will make you even MORE money, or his term is a \u201chigh income skill.\u201d Then, with that EXTRA money - you can continue re-investing back into yourself.\n\nFIFTH: According to Bryce Welker - Write an E Book\nHe advocates writing an e-book, then marketing it online to produce sales. However, I believe the market is incredibly difficult to get into - and e-books are a little dated in this year, when video course are the current go-to. \n\nSIXTH: According to Moran Pober: Buy a multimillion-dollar business with other peoples\u2019 money\nIf that sounds too good to be true\u2026let me read you this:\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even need $100 if you\u2019re willing to buy an established business.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t even need relevant experience \u2014 you just need to find a business that has been around for five or 10 years.\"\n\nSEVENTH: According to Torben Platzer- Spend $100 building a personal brand. \nHis philosophy is that brands spend a lot of money on influencer marketing\u2026 because of that, if you become an influencer\u2026you can get some of that sweet, sweet brand money. So you can film a video about your \u201cmission\u201d\u2026spend $100 on ads\u2026.and start driving traffic to make MILLIONS. \n\nEIGHTH: According to Matt Clark - Spend $100 on education to sell product on Amazon\nNow, I\u2019d argue that this method DOES work - although from a technical standpoint, it\u2019s probably just way easier to dropship products than actually take hold of inventory and tie up capital. And, the level of work required to actually get good at this and make money is pretty intensive. \n\nNINTH: According to Rudy Mawer - Launch a coaching business\nI have to say it\u2026the coaching businesses tends to be a very fly-by-night industry. While there are CERTAINLY some INSANELY good business coaches out there, and I don\u2019t mean to discredit that\u2026the vast majority of them are an utter waste of time. \n\nTENTH: According to myself, Graham Stephan (just put that there for YouTube SEO, fyi)\n\nIf you just want to make a one-time investment, and that\u2019s it\u2026your best chance is PROBABLY a lottery ticket, as horrible as that is to say. Otherwise, that leaves you with TWO other viable methods of becoming a millionaire from a $100 investment: \n\nThe first, is investing that money in yourself through education - and then using those skills to actually go and make a decent amount of money. $100, you can get yourself a LOT of good content. This includes the books: Think and grow rich - How to win friends and influence people - Awaken the giant within - The 4 hour work week - The 1% Rule - Secrets of the millionaire mind -The millionaire next door\n\nSecondly, you can invest that $100 into SOMETHING that will make you money. Because at the end of the day - turning $100 into $1 million isn\u2019t possible without either a LOT of luck, or an insane work ethic, expertise, and the ability to delay gratification and re-invest everything you make BACK into that business to make even more money\u2026and only with that\u2026and smashing the like button\u2026can you turn $100 into a million. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

You NEED to be clear about what you want, and by KNOWING what that is, you\u2019ll be better able to get there. BUT, at least for me\u2026sometimes Long Term Goals just seem too distant to provide any sort of urgency. hat\u2019s why you NEED to ALSO create short term goals\u2026these should be goals for the week, or for the month, or something that\u2019s so close by so that you have an URGENCY in getting it done. \n\nSECOND: Ceate a TO-DO list EVERY SINGLE DAY\nJust like when you create your short and long term goals\u2026your DAILY TO-DO LIST is going now to be the holy grail of your entire day. And with this, understand Parkinson\u2019s Law: Your work expands\u00a0so as to fill the\u00a0time available\u00a0for its completion. So begin implementing deadlines as to when each task needs to get completed\u2026and magically, you\u2019ll be able to get everything done that much faster. \n\nTHIRD: Meditation\nPrior to a few months ago, I thought the whole thing was bogus, and I just didn\u2019t get it. But I gotta say, the first time I really gave it an honest shot with an open mind\u2026something just clicked. So, over the last few months, I\u2019ve been meditating twice per day, almost every single day, for 15 minutes each\u2026and it\u2019s made such a difference. What was first this stupid, pointless thing\u2026is now something I really look forward to, that brings me a lot of creative, positive thoughts once I\u2019m able to tune out all the clutter of my mind, and all the worry of everything that needs to get done.\n\nFOURTH: A consistent sleep schedule\nIt turns out, though - scientifically - our bodies do BEST with that type of consistency, of going to bed - and waking up every single day at the exact same time. You\u2019ll find that your body adapts to whatever schedule you give it - and when you throw that balance out of wack - your body\u2019s chemistry works in overdrive to compensate for that. Studies have also found that irregular sleep schedules lead to poorer performance, weaker memory, and a worse QUALITY of sleep when you DID go to sleep. \n\nFIFTH: Exercise and going to the gym\nI\u2019ve found that there\u2019s nothing that makes you feel better, that gets you more motivated, that brings you more energy, that gets you more clear headed - than going to the gym and working out. Not only that, but the HEALTH benefits of going to the gym on a regular basis are IMMEASURABLE. \n\nSIXTH: Get in the daily habit of NOT procrastinating. \nIt\u2019s called The 2 Minute Rule. Here\u2019s the concept: MOST things we stress about and procrastinate on, really don\u2019t take THAT much time to do. So, the 2 minute rule suggests that whatever you can do in 2 minutes or less, you should get done IMMEDIATELY. Whether it\u2019s a text message you were meaning to send, or replying to an email, or even just cleaning up after yourself\u2026don\u2019t postpone it\u2026if it\u2019s 2 minutes or less, just go and do it right now. \n\n\nSEVENTH: Being Consistent, Daily \nTrust me, without consistency - everything above is pointless. Don\u2019t waste your time creating goals, pushing yourself at the gym, meditating, and creating a sleep schedule - if you\u2019re just going to dabble with it here and there, stop for a little bit - then come back to it later, and quit again\u2026you\u2019re just not going to see results, it\u2019s going to be frustrating, and it\u2019s not going to end well. Beyond ANYTHING\u2026ALL of this fails if you don\u2019t stay consistent with it because consistency is like the GLUE that holds all of this together. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

If the markets go up - great, you make money. If the markets go DOWN - great, you bought in at a lower price. \n\n#2 Regret: Not investing aggressively enough\nIf you\u2019re investing money that you\u2019ll need within the next few years, most likely - you shouldn\u2019t be investing in anything speculative, or risky. Second, if you INVEST money, and you find yourself PANICKING when it drops a few percent\u2026chances are, you invested more than you should\u2019ve, you didn\u2019t research the investment as well as you could have, and you\u2019ll either need to make SAFER investments in the future - or remind yourself that investing is very much like a yo-yo, and that price swings are a normal, every day part of investing. \n\n#3 Regret: Wishing they had made MORE trades. \nUnfortunately, this is another one that\u2019s easy to point to - in hindsight - after you\u2019ve already seen how the market performed. But, in reality - not trading enough is really only a reflection of what information you know - in the moment - and based on how well you understand that particular investment. \n\n#4 Regret: Wishing they had invested more cautiously \nTo me, this is a strong indication that you should more reasonably adjust your expectations, and if you cannot cover potential loss - you shouldn\u2019t be investing that much in speculative investments in the first place. Especially if the overall market is UP 30%\u2026and your biggest regret was going too big\u2026the way I see it, that\u2019s not investing\u2026that\u2019s gambling. \n\nAnd then\u2026of course, we\u2019ve got my favorite group\u2026the 30% of investors who have no regrets. Because they understand the principles of long term investing, and they\u2019re the people who smash the like button before the video even starts because they appreciate all the free content. \n\nSo when it comes to investing, especially in 2020\u2026all that matters is consistency. It\u2019s such basic advice, but it\u2019s so true\u2026time in the market always beats timing the market. Every single time, for the last 100 years\u2026just buy and hold. Try not to trade too often. And don\u2019t get emotional\u2026.and you\u2019ll come out VERY very wealthy in the future. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFirst, and the most reasonable goal that I think everyone should aim to hit in your 20s\u2026is to get your credit score above 750:\nFor anyone who\u2019s not aware\u2026your credit score is just a calculation that shows how responsible you are in paying back money that you owe. That might include credit cards, auto loans, student loans, a mortgage payment\u2026or, anything else where you aren\u2019t paying for something with your own money, upfront. And this term known as a \u201cCredit Score\u201d is basically a grade that lenders use when determining how much of a loan you\u2019ll get, and what interest rate you\u2019ll pay. \n\nSecond, speaking of paying off debt\u2026it would make me happy if, by the time you\u2019re 30\u2026you\u2019ve gotten yourself, what I like to call\u2026\u201dBAD-DEBT FREE.\u201d It\u2019s like saying \u201cDebt Free\u201d\u2026except it\u2019s BAD DEBT FREE. \nSo, really - from the way I see it - it\u2019s not necessary to want to call yourself entirely DEBT FREE by the age of 30\u2026.because, some types of debt can actually be really useful in terms of making more money and being financially responsible. \n\nThird, by the age of 30, you should have at LEAST 1.5 years of your expenses invested. \nThat means, if you\u2019re spending $3000 per month on rent, utilities, car payment, food, and smashing the like button\u2026you should have, at MINIMUM, $54,000 invested in the markets. Or, if your spending $2000 a month\u2026that equals $36,000 invested. \n\nFourth, I highly recommend that - by the age of 30 - you create a SECOND source of income in addition to your main job. \nThis is something I\u2019m surprised isn\u2019t mentioned more\u2026because, as you get older and advance further in your career\u2026it\u2019s so important to use that as LEVERAGE to make even more money, and diversify your income into other areas. After all, when surveyed, it was found that nearly 2 out of 3 millionaires had at least ONE extra source of income - with the most common being real estate investing:\nhttps:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/how-millionaires-manage-money-interviews-2018-12\/commerce-on-business-insider\n\nFifth, by the age of 30\u2026I\u2019d recommend that you aim to save at LEAST 25% of your income each year, and invest that amount towards your retirement. \nFor most people to save and invest 25% of their income, it takes skill. You need to be dedicated to tracking your expenses, you need to be disciplined when it comes to your spending, you need to live below your means, and you need to place an importance on the future\u2026and investing 25% of your income just comes as a byproduct of doing all of those things, consistently. Not only that, but it also motivates you to increase your income, just so that you\u2019re able to maximize the value of your own time - and then pocket the difference. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

You\u2019d think that, for $240 per year\u2026you\u2019d get at least some type of supportive community behind it, some level of personal interaction, or something that\u2019s really insightful towards building Financial Freedom\u2026but, really, you don\u2019t.  \n\nThe way I see it, the entire concept was so poorly done, and for someone who\u2019s build up an audience of nearly 20 million people\u2026you\u2019d think he would be doing other, more lucrative things\u2026not masterminding a financial freedom movement, targeted towards young adults, with nonstop upsells and advertisements for more expensive training. \n\nBut, not all hope is lost\u2026by going through this course, I did get my $20\u2019s worth of entertainment\u2026and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned:\n\nOne: If you want people to think you\u2019re more important than you actually are, buy a whole bunch of fake instagram followers. Sure, people like me will know those numbers are all fake\u2026but, that doesn\u2019t matter, because the type of people to actually buy your program will have no idea. \n\nTwo: Always have an upsell. Once you get someone\u2019s small investment, upfront..they\u2019ll be more likely to proceed forward and buy even MORE expensive things, later\u2026because you\u2019ve already got them hooked in. \n\nThree: You know what people love more than getting a discount? Getting a 99% off discount. So, go ahead and mark up prices as high as you can\u2026just so you can bring them back down to pennies on the dollar, later. \n\nAnd Four: The best way to make money online\u2026is to talk about how to make money, online. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com","publishedAt":"2020-02-25T05:00:04Z","tags":["financial freedom","millionaire","how to be a millionaire","jake paul financial freedom","jake paul","i bought the jake paul course","jake paul program","pewdiepie","how to invest","how to invest in stocks","how to invest in real estate","investing for beginners","investing in your 20s","how to inverst in your 20s","how to make money online","robinhood","robinhood app","best stock trading app","credit score","credit score explained","best credit card","how i became a millionaire"],"title":"Millionaire Exposes The Jake Paul Financial Freedom Scam","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HGQ41L6lFBM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HGQ41L6lFBM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HGQ41L6lFBM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HGQ41L6lFBM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HGQ41L6lFBM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT21M26S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"6786","dislikeCount":"1323","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"98425","viewCount":"1307042"}},{"id":"0w0-QbY57jQ","snippet":{"description":"According to a survey, 78% of workers live paycheck to paycheck - here is how to STOP living paycheck to paycheck and the best strategies to grow your wealth.

Even though I don\u2019t have any conclusive research to back this up, I believe that the TYPE of person to overspend at $50,000 - would be just as likely to overspend at $200,000 - which is why, overall, spending increases in proportion to your income. Even if they are barely scraping by at $200,000 - increasing their income to $500,000 wouldn\u2019t solve the underlying issue. \n\nThis might even be a derisive of Parkinson\u2019s Law, which suggests that our work expands to fill the time available - or, in this case, our spending expands to fill our available income. So, the only way to BREAK this cycle in the first place is to NOT give in to lifestyle inflation, and make a VERY conscious effort to keep your spending THE EXACT SAME - regardless of how much you\u2019re making. \n\nSo, at least from that perspective\u2026we can understand the psychology behind why people aren\u2019t saving money, aren\u2019t are they should be saving, spend as much as they make - regardless of how much they make, and will always worry about money until the end of time. But, if you take a proactive approach to fixing this problem\u2026you CAN make a difference:\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m a firm believer in focusing on the things we have full control over, NOW, and what we can actually do to make a positive step in the right direction, today. And part of that comes with taking responsibility for our own actions, and realizing that we can direct our finances in any way we chose\u2026and that all starts with budgeting. \n\nSince less than 1\/3rd of workers surveyed had a budget\u2026and 78% live paycheck to paycheck\u2026I think it\u2019s no surprise, a budget should be the FIRST thing on anyone\u2019s list who isn\u2019t saving the money that they need. This, to me, is even more important than finding a new job or making more money\u2026because, again, if the initial problem isn\u2019t solved\u2026it\u2019ll continue. \n\nSo, to make a budget\u2026I\u2019d highly recommend free resources like Mint.com or PersonalCapital.com, which will automatically track your income and expenses - and then give you a detailed breakdown of where every last dollar is going. \n\nBy doing that, you can better identify the things you don\u2019t need to spend money on\u2026and then, create a budget to cut back. If Americans are spending, on average, $500 on non-essential spending\u2026there is FOR SURE room to cut back.\n\nSecond, to help stave away lifestyle inflation\u2026I highly recommend SAVING AND INVESTING YOUR MONEY FIRST, and then SPENDING what\u2019s left over\u2026not the other way around. \n\nI also recommend waiting to buy anything that isn\u2019t already in your budget, even if it\u2019s just 24 hours\u2026because, most of the time - when you sleep on something overnight\u2026you\u2019ll wake up the next day and realize that, eh, you don\u2019t really want it all that bad.\n\nAnd third, realize that this applies to nearly EVERYONE. Consider it like going to the gym\u2026just because your in shape, doesn\u2019t mean you stop going to the gym\u2026because, after all, that\u2019s what got you in shape to begin with.

Once I drove the car, I became such a fan of \u201cTesla\u201d that I decided to throw some money in Tesla stock, at $260 per share, in hopes that maybe over time, it\u2019ll help pay for the sales tax of the car. I\u2019m not usually the type of person to go and invest in individual stocks like this, but - I figured - I\u2019m a fan of the company, I want to support what they do, and I\u2019ll just invest an amount that I\u2019d be comfortable with losing. \n\nOver time, though\u2026the company does better, Model 3 sales look promising, Elon Musk cuts costs\u2026and, in what seems like home-run after home-run for Tesla\u2026the stock started going up, a LOT. And that brings us to this year. \n\nOnce the price of the stock jumped past $900 in a matter of a day  - I felt it was approaching a level that just wasn\u2019t sustainable, and driven more-so by the euphoria of profit, rather than the fundamentals of the company. And, even though I believe in Tesla Long Term\u2026I had also tripled my money, and felt it would be a good idea lock in some profit. So, I sold off 50% of my Tesla holdings at $912 per share\u2026and on that, I made a 350% return within a year. \n\nI suppose, on the surface\u2026Tesla has quite a few things going for it: One, several analysts have boosted their expectations for the stock - causing more demand, and more people piling in to buy in. Piper Sandler also just announced a Tesla Price Target of $928 - and Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $1200 - which was, at least partially, responsible for some of the recent rally to get Tesla where it is today. \n\nNow, as far as my thoughts on all of this\u2026even with prices reaching ABOVE where I sold half my Tesla stock a few weeks ago\u2026I don\u2019t regret selling. Sure, in hindsight\u2026if I had a way to predict the future, of course\u2026I\u2019d absolutely have rather just waited, obviously. If we KNEW what was going to happen, selling at anything lower would\u2019ve been stupid. \n\nBut, that brings us to the entire premise of investing in that - on a speculative stock increase like this - NO ONE can predict what\u2019s going to happen, and we all need to make the most calculated decision we can, at the time, with the information we have available to us. Sometimes, you\u2019re going to be right - and, sometimes, you\u2019re going to be wrong - and I can confidently say that it\u2019s IMPOSSIBLE to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future. \n\nIt\u2019s about being SMART with your money, knowing your tolerance to price fluctuations, and being OK with locking in profits - or holding out - knowing you\u2019ll need to be OK with that decision. And, for me\u2026that\u2019s why I decided to sell 50% of my holdings, and then hang on to the rest. \n\nSo, anyway\u2026there are my thoughts on Tesla, the basics and fundamentals of investing long term, and the importance of being patient and knowing your own risk tolerance to sell and lock in profits, and not get carried away with emotion. And, like I said in the last video about this\u2026we\u2019ll look back and see how this all plays out. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This place had been occupied for over 10 years, and the prior owner and landlord before me, pretty much did no work to this place whatsoever. \n-Then\u2026.in the second update of this series, posted on December 20th\u2026we started doing demo, and tearing the unit apart to see what\u2019s behind the walls. \n-And finally, the last video I posted on January 10th of last month\u2026when the cost of this entire renovation exceeded $100,000. \n\nNow - it turns out the electrical wiring needs to be replaced, and remodeling and replacing that is an extra $10,000. \n\nNext, we had to replace the ceiling jousts because the old beams were 100 years old and sagging. And the only way to have a completely flat, smooth ceiling was to cut them out and then replace them. \n\nWe also had to level out all the floors since, over time, things have moved and shifted around a bit, and so far - we got that done by laying some board over top. But, the bad news is that the current hardwood floors are going to be difficult to salvage and keep everything level at the same time without spending a ridiculous amount of money - so, with that, we\u2019re going to have to put new flooring over top of this. \n\nBesides, that though\u2026everything is really coming along nicely. \n\nPlus, from a tax perspective - everything I spend here can be depreciated against my rental income, so that saves me money on future taxes. For all of you real estate people out there - who love saving money on taxes - here\u2019s how it works. \n\nYou typically have 2 ways to save money on taxes by doing this - one is by taking the total cost of the renovation, and then dividing that by 27.5 - and that means, every year, you can depreciate that amount against your income. \n\nOR - you have the option to do what\u2019s called Cost Segregation Analysis - This is when you accelerate the depreciation for certain items, like floors, countertops, etc over a shorter period of time\u2026like, if I spent $10,000 on floors - instead of depreciating that over 27.5 years, I might be able to depreciate it over 5 years, as an example - saving me even more money upfront. \n\nSo, in a way - even though I\u2019m spending all of this money fixing it up, in order to get higher rent - I\u2019m still able to use these costs as a write off, to save money on taxes, at the same time. So, at least that\u2019s a pretty good reason to invest in real estate, fix it up, - and it helps offset some of the amount I\u2019m spending to fix the place up. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is the reason why Warren Buffet suggested that the MAJORITY of investors out there, just place 10% of their income in cash, and the other 90% in a low cost SP500 index fund like this one.\n\nSecond, though\u2026we have another favorite investment of mine, and this is definitely where almost ALL of my money goes at this point\u2026and that would be Real Estate \nNow, this type of investment is INSANELY more intricate, time consuming, and risky than just going and buying an index fund and then doing nothing\u2026but, the returns I get from this are so much higher, and when you really know what you\u2019re doing - you have the potential to make a LOT of money. \n\nWhen it comes to myself, my investment strategy really just boils down to this\u2026so, here\u2019s my entire blueprint: \n\n1. Buying an undervalued property that I can get at a good deal on\n2. Buying that property in an area that I\u2019m expecting will go up in value over the next 10 years\n3. Get a low interest, fixed rate, 30 year loan on the property\n4. Renovate and fix up the property so it\u2019ll be worth even more by the time I\u2019m done with it\n5. Rent out the property, and the rents should cover all of my expenses plus profit\n6. Repeat this same process and do it over and over again \n\nHOWEVER\u2026.there are some downsides to doing this, because like I mentioned\u2026returns like this doesn\u2019t come without risk: it\u2019s a lot of work, there\u2019s a high barrier to entry because you WILL need a good credit score and sufficient income to get a loan from the bank, and this type of investment is fairly illiquid. Plus, dealing with tenants isn\u2019t for everyone. \n\nThird, would be INDIVIDUAL STOCKS:\nNow, admittedly\u2026this isn\u2019t something I do often because I believe, overall\u2026index funds are better for the majority of investors out there. However, I do dabble buying individual stocks every now and then. Now, I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that picking individual stocks is riskier than buying real estate - it\u2019s certainly not as time consuming, and the upside CAN be even better - but, the likelihood that you\u2019ll lose money, long term, is also just as much present. \n\nBUT, individual stocks can be a great way to invest if you have the interest in going for it - and don\u2019t lose as much sleep as I do checking prices constantly. \u00a0\n\nFourth: HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNTS: https:\/\/youtu.be\/F2yYiTKRizE\nIt\u2019s ALWAYS a good idea to have cash sitting on the sidelines, either while you wait for the right investment to come along, if you need it to pay bills, or for your emergency fund in case anything happens. Even though it doesn\u2019t make a ton of money, and it\u2019s really just on pace to match inflation - at the very least, my sitting money is making SOMETHING. \n\nFifth: INVEST IN YOU\nThis might come in the form of buying a book, or traveling somewhere just to be able to meet someone I could learn from. It could be an investment of time to gain a new experience, broaden my perspective, or see a different point of view. Not all investments have to be money-related, and in terms of what will generate the biggest return - whatever you invest in yourself will generally get the best outcome. \n\nI also consider it a smart idea to re-invest in yourself, in ways that make you genuinely happy. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

By doing that, you can lead a more financially flexible lifestyle, with less obligation, and that gives you more freedom to pursue what you REALLY want to do\u2026like smashing the like button\u2026so it\u2019s all about cutting back on what DOESN\u2019T matter, so that you can spend MORE on what does. \n\nHowever, it takes work. It\u2019s a constant battle of prioritizing your expenditures, really paying attention to where you get the most value, not giving in to immediate gratification, and sticking with it long term. The end goal is about maximizing what you have RIGHT NOW, and investing the difference so you can maintain the financial security that allows you to pretty much do whatever you want, and walk away from whatever you don\u2019t like.\n\nBut, there\u2019s also ANOTHER side to this that isn\u2019t really talked about much\u2026and that\u2019s the fact that, sometimes - reducing expenses, and saving as much as you can, can only take you so far. You can only save so much\u2026until, at SOME point, you literally just don\u2019t have anything more left to save - and then you\u2019re stuck. \n\nThat\u2019s why there ARE downsides to saving too much, as hard as that can be to believe. What\u2019s the point of saving everything if you can\u2019t do what you really enjoy\u2026if you can\u2019t take the vacations you want, or get the life experiences that you otherwise would have, if you just had more money?\n\nAnd that\u2019s why Financial Minimalism is, in a way\u2026just as much about MAKING MORE MONEY - and MAXIMIZING your value - as it is about recognizing what you want, and what\u2019s important. \n\nThis reminds me of an old reddit thread posted a few years ago with the title: \u201cBuild the life you want, and then save for it\u201d - link here: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/58j8pc\/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it\/\n\nFrom this, MrLlamaSC recommended that the solution was to first figure out what you want out of life, find out how much that\u2019ll cost - and then develop your investment and savings plan around THAT. Really think to yourself - without money getting in the way - what\u2019s ACTUALLY important to you? \n\nAnd second - this post also recommended leaving a little room for new experiences. After all, our priorities change over time and that\u2019s completely ok. So give yourself some wiggle room to pay for that upfront, and plan that into your lifestyle and overall savings goals. \n\nAnd while it\u2019s certainly worth it to be mindful of your spending, and not live above your means\u2026it\u2019s also just as important to think about the bigger picture, and realize that life isn\u2019t meant to be enjoyed in the distant future\u2026you can still have a chance at that, NOW, within your means, by prioritizing your life around that. \n\nThis is why MAKING MORE MONEY has just as much of a place in Financial Minimalism, as - lets say - reducing expenses. And, instead of seeing the two as polar opposites\u2026you see them as complementing one another, to get you closer to your goal of building the lifestyle you want - and then having your investments pay for it. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

There won\u2019t be any miscommunications, expectations will be managed, and the entire framework of your lease will not only give your tenants a great place to live\u2026BUT YOU the compensation you need to stay in business. Ideally, this should be a win-win for everyone involved - and your tenants will know EXACTLY what to expect, and what you must give THEM in return for renting your home. \n\nSecond, another HUGE mistake I see so many landlords make is by NOT properly screening your tenants.\nTo start, it\u2019s really important that you always TRUST - BUT VERIFY EVERYTHING THAT THE TENANTS SAY. For me, I begin by having my tenants use the website MySmartMove.com - which gives me a complete background profile of their credit report, score, as well as a residential and criminal background history. If they pass that, I\u2019ll then verify their employment status. I\u2019ll do the same with their residence history. Remember: It\u2019s BETTER to leave your home UNRENTED for an extra month or two, than it is to get a sub-par tenant. \n\nThird, you must ALWAYS abide by the contract. \nThere really shouldn\u2019t be ANY misunderstandings or unusual interpretations when it comes to a real estate contract, as long as you use a thorough lease agreement for your state\u2026and really, from there\u2026all YOU need to do, as a Landlord, is FOLLOW IT! It sounds so simple, but that 8-10 page contract lays the entire foundation of your job and duties as a property owner - and you\u2019ll be an incredible investor if you just pay attention to what\u2019s written, and stick with it. \n\nFourth, you will be on call 24\/7.\nYou have to be prepared to get calls and texts at the most random hours for the most random things\u2026and sometimes, that will require you to stop what you\u2019re doing and attend to whatever issue comes up. \n\nFifth: if something CAN break\u2026it WILL break. \nAnd always make sure you buy high quality, durable materials\u2026rather than cheap, easily breakable materials\u2026because if you don\u2019t do that, you\u2019ll waste a lot of money replacing things that shouldn\u2019t have needed to be replaced, because the tenants will NOT care for it like it\u2019s their own.  \n\nSixth: Real estate is a people business. \nOwning rental property is also just as much about effectively communicating with people, learning how to say no, being able to stand your ground, and articulate the details of the contract. AND\u2026at the same time as doing all of that\u2026you need to LISTEN to the other persons concerns and address whatever comes up. \n\nReal estate investing can be absolutely AMAZING for the people who are willing to put in the work and take it seriously\u2026after all, it\u2019s basically what I owe nearly everything to, and what I throw all of my money in each year. But, it isn\u2019t without some growing pains - and these are issues every landlord has to go through at some point or another. But if, at the very least, you can learn from my experiences and not make the same mistakes I did\u2026then at least, my mistakes were not made in vain, and can hopefully save you money\u2026so you\u2019ll have more left over to smash the like button for the algorithm. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

They\u2019re investing with the mentality that the stock market should progressively and automatically increase year after year, and they\u2019ve never experienced a time where the markets drop. That, I believe\u2026is a dangerous combination, where it\u2019s easy for people to get ahead of themselves and potentially be caught in a situation where they over-invest - and then have NO IDEA what to do during a bear market when they lose money. \n\nWho knows when that will happen, it could be tomorrow, or it could be in another 10 years\u2026but, it\u2019s important that you set yourself up in a good position NOW so that when it DOES happen, you will be ok. \n\nFIRST, think to yourself\u2026if your investments dropped 20-40% right now\u2026WOULD YOU BE OK? If this is something that would DRAMATICALLY worry you, get you so fearful about losing money, and cause you to sell everything off as a way to preserve your capital\u2026then, you really need to reconsider how much you\u2019re investing, and try to spread out your risk as much as you can. \n\nSECOND, have a LONG TERM outlook on your investments. To be honest, no one know what will happen over the next few years\u2026but, HISTORICALLY, since the inception of the stock market, a 20-year holding period has never ONCE produced a negative result. \nhttps:\/\/fourpillarfreedom.com\/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928\/\n\nTHIRD - it\u2019s also important, no matter what - to keep an emergency fund worth 3-6 months of your expenses. This is your safety net in case the stock market crashes, you lose your job, and the entire economy sinks into an endless pit\u2026at least you have 3-6 months worth of savings to hold you through until you find another job, or re-adjust your lifestyle to be able to save a little more money. \n\nFOURTH - I also highly recommend you pay down any high interest rate or variable interest rate debt NOW, while the going is good. That means any credit card debt, any personal loans, or any short term mortgages should probably be paid off as much as you can. I\u2019m just a firm believer that you should make hay while the sun is shining - and when the going is good, NOW is your time to put yourself in the best financial position possible. \n\nAnd FIFTH - since this video is about How To Invest in 2020\u2026here\u2019s my overall advice, and exactly what to do, regardless of what happens in the market:\n\nFirst, look into maxing out your retirement accounts:\nI recommend most people begin by maxing out what\u2019s called a Roth IRA an contributing to a 401k, as well.\n\nSecond, in terms of WHAT to invest in - the choice is really yours. But, typically\u2026I like the Index Fund. This is just a broad investment that tracks the overall market - so, if the entire market does well - so do you. \n\nIf you want to invest in individual stocks\u2026LIKE TESLA\u2026be my guest. But understand that doing that is MUCH risker. \n\nAnd, third\u2026just do all of this consistently. Investing is NOT meant to be a one-and-done approach\u2026.you\u2019re meant to invest a consistent amount, every month or every year, without skipping a beat\u2026and doing that allows you to buy in to the lowest lows, and the highest highs, and average out your buy-in long term. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

As soon as I drove home, I figured I\u2019d throw some money into Tesla Stock, because I felt like if I loved the car this much\u2026other people would, too - and that would bode well for the future price of Tesla. And that\u2019s when I bought in at $260 per share. \n\nWell\u2026flash forward to now. Last month, Tesla was trading for $451 per share. A week later it was $537. Overnight, it jumped from $580 to $640 a share. Then from Friday to Monday\u2026it went from $650 to $780. And then, today\u2026from $780 to $914 by the time I\u2019m making this video. \n\nWhile the EXACT factors that contribute to this type of explosive growth are difficult to pinpoint\u2026we do have a few topics we can look at:\n\nFirst, I mentioned this in a previous video\u2026but Tesla was the #1 most shorted stock on the market. Which, if you\u2019re not familiar with what that is\u2026shorting a stock is basically a BET that the price of the stock will go down - and if it DOES go down, you make money. If the stock goes UP - you LOSE money. \n\nAfter all, it\u2019s estimated that 18% of all Tesla Stocks are shorted\u2026and given how much the stock has risen in the last week, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising that those Tesla Short Sellers have to pay a significant amount to cover their losses - and if there aren\u2019t enough people to SELL the stock in the first place, that would cause demand for the stock to rise fairly quickly.\n\nSecond, and this is just theory - but the overseas markets fell about 9% on Monday from health fears\u2026and amid the selloff, their bank injected $173 billion dollars of capital into the financial system. It COULD be theorized that, maybe\u2026as people sold off their investments in China, they looked for OTHER investments that could make up for their losses\u2026and Tesla was one of them, given the recent run-up in price. Again, there\u2019s no PROOF for this\u2026but this is just merely speculation, so take that for what it\u2019s worth. \n\nThird, you also have another analyst who raised their price expectations for Tesla stock from $556 to $808\u2026was definitely fueled more demand for this stock to grow even further. Not to mention, we have ANOTHER analyst who predicts a $7000 Tesla stock by 2024\u2026and, at that point, it just becomes a free for all. \n\nAnd fourth\u2026 I think there\u2019s something to be said about the euphoria of making money, and I\u2019m a little concerned that excitement is driving the market more than logic\u2026and at that point, I have to question the current valuation at this moment in time. \n\nSo, given that\u2026I ended up selling HALF of my Tesla position at $912 per share, and then I\u2019m holding on to my other half just to see what happens. This way, I can be a completely SANE and REASONABLE Investor who isn\u2019t afraid to take some profits off the table when the time is right\u2026or, in other words\u2026when I\u2019ve more than tripled my investment in less than a year. \n\nBut, also, I\u2019m not going to sell off everything because I still believe in them, and I think they have the potential to one day become a trillion dollar company depending on how well they continue to innovate. So, hopefully\u2026this is the best of both worlds.\n\nAnd really\u2026no one can predict what this is going to do. I mean, we can all do our best to analyze the TRUE fundamentals of what Tesla is worth\u2026and I\u2019m sure each of us will have our own valuation. But, at the end of the day\u2026it\u2019s worth what someone else is willing to pay. \n\nBut, again\u2026this is not financial advice.

Your secured credit card will get you 2% cash back on restaurants and gas stations, AND you\u2019ll get unlimited 1% cash back on everything else. They\u2019re also running a promotion where they will MATCH your cash back in the first year.\n\nSECOND: The Apple Credit Card\nFirst, there\u2019s no annual fee\u2026this is INSANELY important for anyone just starting out, because a LARGE part of your credit score is made up by the LENGTH OF YOUR CREDIT HISTORY. In addition to no annual fees, they\u2019ll also give you DAILY cash back\u2026like, 3% cash back on apple products and with select merchants. You\u2019ll also get 2% cash back on any purchases made with Apple Pay, and then 1% cash back on everything else. \n\nTHIRD: Amazon Rewards Card\nFirst, there\u2019s no annual fee. If you get the Amazon Prime Rewards Card - which  requires you to have a valid Amazon Prime membership to get the full benefit, you\u2019ll get a $100 amazon gift card for signing up, and then you\u2019ll get unlimited 5% cash back on all amazon and Whole Foods purchases, and 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores\u2026and then 1% cash back on everything else. \n\nThe OTHER card I\u2019m referring to is just the normal Amazon Rewards Card\u2026this is what you could get if you DON\u2019T pay for Amazon Prime, and you\u2019ll still get rewards\u2026.just not as much. For example, they\u2019ll give you a $50 Amazon Credit when you sign up, 3% cash back on amazon purchases, 2% at restaurants and gas stations, and then 1% back on everything else. \n\nFOURTH: Bank of America Cash Rewards Card. \nJust like the others, there\u2019s no annual fee. At the moment, hey\u2019ll also give you a $200 cash bonus when you spend $1000 on the credit card within the first 90 days. THEN\u2026if you\u2019re already a Bank of America Preferred Rewards Member, you can get a cash back booster on the credit card, potentially turning a 3% cash back into a 5.25% reward \n\nFIFTH: American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card\nThis is one of the few American Express cards that carries NO ANNUAL FEE\u2026so it\u2019s entirely free to use. Plus, you can earn $150 back when you spend $1000 on the card within the first 3 months. AND you\u2019ll get 3% cash back at Supermarkets, 2% cash back at grocery stores, and 1% back on everything else. \n\nAnd just to tie all of this together, if you want a step by step of what to do:\n\nFirst, sign up for the Discover It Secured Card with a $200 deposit. Once you get the card, all you need to do is put a few of your normal expenses on the card each month\u2026and then pay it off in full. You will do this for 6 months. \n\nSecond, if you want to expedite the credit building process just a little further\u2026around the same time you apply for the Discover It card, also apply for the Capital One Secured Card. \n\nThird, after 6 months of doing this\u2026you\u2019ll want to apply for either the Apple Credit Card or Amazon Credit Card. These will be your first \u201cunsecured credit cards.\u201d With these cards, you\u2019ll just do the same thing as the first two\u2026just put small expenses on it, and pay it off in full by the time it\u2019s due. \n\nFourth, from there\u2026after 8-12 months from getting your first card\u2026go and open up the American Express Blue Cash Card. \n\nThen, after 12 months\u2026you should have built up enough of a credit foundation to have a score above 750! \n\n*Some of the card links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

A 20 year holding period of the SP500 has never ONCE produced a negative result. \nhttps:\/\/fourpillarfreedom.com\/heres-how-the-sp-500-has-performed-since-1928\/\n\nSECOND: INVEST CONSISTENTLY\nDo not do ANYTHING differently when the market drops in price, and just carry on as usual. Don\u2019t go dumping everything you possibly have into the markets\u2026unless that was your strategy from the very beginning\u2026and, instead, just continue buying in at normal intervals. \n\nTHIRD: HAVE AN EMERGENCY FUND\nIdeally, this is the money you have saved up that\u2019s equivalent to 3-6 months of your expenses\u2026and this going to be what you can fall back on, in the event you lose your job, your income slows down, or if\u2026one day\u2026we figure out that pigs can fly. Trust me, having money saved up - in cash - takes all the pressure off being worried about how your investments are doing, and knowing you have something to fall back on is worth the peace of mind. \n\nFOURTH: DIVERSIFY YOUR INVESTMENTS\nIf you personally can\u2019t handle a 15% drop in prices without panicking\u2026then, maybe, you\u2019re invested too aggressively. If you\u2019re completely in US equities stocks, look into adding international stocks and bonds into the mix. Or, look into eventually investing in real estate, where property values tend to be a little more stable.  Keep enough cash on the side to make you comfortable, because the most important piece of advice is just to hold long term. \n\nFIFTH: REDUCE YOUR SPENDING\nSeriously, I know this isn\u2019t investment related\u2026but\u2026this is so important. If you\u2019re able to cut back on spending right now, you can apply more money towards paying down high interest debt, reducing your overhead, and putting more money in stocks while they\u2019re down. \n\nThis is my exact plan for investing moving forward\u2026and I don\u2019t intend to change a single thing that what I\u2019ve already been doing. The stock market does not change that. \n\nSo, there are my thoughts on the whole situation, and what my plan is, as well\u2026I\u2019m not doing anything differently, I\u2019m not concerned, I\u2019m not worried, and nothing changes.

People were panicking that they had unexecuted trades, had shorted the market and wanted to cash out, or wanted to buy in at a time where the market was soaring back to life.\n\nHowever, if that wasn\u2019t bad enough\u2026Robinhood was able to get the app working again after the trading day was over\u2026but then again, the NEXT DAY...this morning, the app goes down, AGAIN. \n\nNow, as far as what caused this\u2026.we don\u2019t have any definitive proof\u2026but, there\u2019s a thread with nearly 30,000 upvotes on Reddit that mentions that\u2026MAYBE\u2026the reason the app was shut down was because of a coding error that didn\u2019t account for February 29th, the Leap Year. \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/fck1tu\/if_youre_wondering_why_robinhood_wasnt_working\/\n\nAlthough, to be fair\u2026Robinhood recently DENIED this on twitter, saying that: \u201cThe outage was not caused by a failure to code for the leap year. We had instability in a part of our infrastructure that allows our systems to communicate with each other.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/AskRobinhood\/status\/1234861941413351434\n\nAnother POSSIBLE reason for this, though, may have come from unusually high trading volume that Robinhood was not expecting\u2026and, objectively, that would also make sense, because temporary brokerage outages like this are not JUST limited to Robinhood. Both Fidelity AND Vanguard experienced brief delays on an exceptionally busy trading day.\nhttps:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/vanguard-and-fidelity-suffer-brief-outages-on-busy-trading-day-11582930471\n\nRight now, it\u2019s being announced that Robinhood will be offering \u201cCase by Case\u201d compensation for its outage\u2026and according to TechCrunch, \u201cThe company would consider offering billing credits or other, undisclosed forms of compensation. It also added that no customer data, information, or funds were lost during the outage.\u201d\n\nBut, really\u2026here\u2019s what we all need to be aware of. I think this goes without saying\u2026no matter WHICH brokerage you use, you NEED to make sure you never have too much money in one platform, and you need to realize that if this can happen to Robinhood - it can happen to ANY STOCK TRADING APP.\n\nAll of these apps and companies are still RELATIVELY new, and they haven\u2019t proved the test of time in terms of how sustainable they\u2019ll be, long term. We need to remember that many of these companies are considered START UPS\u2026and there WILL be issues. I use apps like Robinhood, WeBull, Acorns, and M1 finance for fun side investments that I can play around with - all with $0 stock trading\u2026but I DON\u2019T use them for holding all of my wealth, and I wouldn\u2019t trust any ONE app with more than I\u2019m comfortable with. \n\nIt\u2019s probably a good idea to go with a brokerage that has a proven track record long term, and to use free stock trading apps as a way to play around with Fun Money\u2026at least until they become more developed. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Now, this is REALLY GOOD if we start to see INFLATION. So, if they RAISE interest rates\u2026debt become more expensive, and - in theory - the cost of goods should come down. \n\nOn the other hand, though\u2026when the Federal Reserve is CONCERNED about the future of our economy, and wants to TRY to maintain stability\u2026they\u2019ll LOWER interest rates to reduce the cost of debt, encourage more people to borrow money, and encourage more investment within the markets. \n\nWhen the FED posted a sudden rate cut of half a point, OUT OF NOWHERE\u2026it signaled to the markets that maybe the economy is more fragile than we thought, and if the FED felt the need to reduce rates so quickly\u2026maybe they know something we don\u2019t. Hence the drop in stocks that day.\n\nFirst, the most notable difference we\u2019ll see is within our Savings Accounts:\nWhen the FED reduces rates like this, it has a direct implication on how much you get paid in your Savings Account. So basically, in other words\u2026savings accounts just aren\u2019t as profitable.\n\nSecond\u2026the other big change we\u2019ll see coming\u2026is actually really good news for real estate\u2026mortgage interest rates are hitting all time lows.\nFrom an interest rate standpoint\u2026there has pretty much NEVER been a better time to buy real estate than right now. That\u2019s because, the cheaper it is to borrow money, the less a property will cost you - which means, theoretically, you can buy MORE of it. This should, in turn, cause real estate prices to go up depending on the market\u2026and, nearly everyone who has a loan right now, would be HIGHLY incentivized to refinance and lower their interest rate. \n\nThird\u2026overall\u2026we\u2019re not really sure how this will effect our economy, long term. \nI mean, honestly\u2026if I had the answer to this\u2026I probably wouldn\u2019t be sitting in my garage making YouTube videos on a Friday morning. Because, on the one hand\u2026lower interest rates SHOULD help us out, it SHOULD raise the price of stocks, and it SHOULD allow us to borrow more money. \n\nIf you want to see past events and how they\u2019ve impacted the stock market - here you go, as mentioned in the video:\nhttps:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=wAblMinB3UMC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=stock+market+performance+watergate+cuban+missile&source=bl&ots=lXZmz3h8HB&sig=ACfU3U3VBwAdXbACZVpE23FKsbV58xBNyg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNrY3lxP7jAhWKLHwKHbhAD2U4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nIn the event we DO see a recession, your NUMBER ONE priority - over everything else - is to stay employed, and keep making money. \n\nSecondly, if you can cut back on your expenses, you\u2019ll be in so much of a better position to take advantage of lower prices, and keep buying into the markets. \n\nThird, I know I just recently said this\u2026but I\u2019m going to say it again: keep a safety fund of 3-6 months worth of your expenses on the sidelines. \n\nFourth, if you can\u2019t handle this type of volatility without worrying\u2026then, either don\u2019t check the markets every day, or rebalance your portfolio so you don\u2019t see such intense swings. \n\nFifth, if we DO enter a bear market\u2026just understand, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s never happened before\u2026. the markets NEVER just go up indefinitely, and you\u2019ll need to do your best to hold out. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nI\u2019m sure - by now - we\u2019ve all heard the saying: Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy, and Greedy When Others Are Fearful. That was a quote by our almighty investing savior, Warren Buffet, who spoke those words during a 1986 shareholder meeting, only a year before the infamous Monday of 1987, where the stock markets plummeted over 22% in a single day. \n\nThat was definitely a moment for history, and since then - regulations have been put in place to prevent such a drop from ever happening again, otherwise known as a stock market \u201cCircuit Breaker.\u201d They act exactly how you\u2019d expect a circuit breaker to act, by temporarily pausing the stock market when a certain loss threshold is met. \n\nSure enough\u2026that\u2019s what we saw today. The markets opened this morning down 7%, which temporarily halted trading for the first 15 minutes of the day. Should things continue to get worse, trading will halt again for another 15 minutes if we see a 13% drop in prices\u2026and, trading will stop ENTIRELY if we see a 20% drop in price in a single day. \n\nAnyway, back to my concern. I remember starting my Real Estate Career in the beginning of 2008, RIGHT as real estate prices had peaked and were about to undergo one of the worst price drops in history. From the outside looking in, it really appeared as though this would\u2019ve been the absolute WORST, UNLUCKIEST time to jump into the markets. However, even though I certainly questioned the timing of my entire career....I gotta say, going through that recession at an early age, in the workforce, at a time where everything kept falling, really provided me with a unique outlook on the markets and how they behave. \n\nSeeing this happen was really such a transformative experience\u2026and now, looking back, I believe it were those moments that REALLY solidified and re-enforced my desire to save as much as I can, cut back on spending, and invest as much as possible\u2026so, THAT WAY, I\u2019d be prepared in the event something happens\u2026like, what we\u2019re seeing today. \n\nNow, I get it\u2026I sound like a broken record because I\u2019ve said it before, time and trim again\u2026.that you CANNOT time the markets, NO ONE knows what\u2019s going to happen, and the BEST strategy is simply to BUY and HOLD. But, whether or not people will actually FOLLOW that advice is an entirely different story. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to believe in the process of \u201cbuy and hold, and invest as soon as possible\u201d when everything is going up. That makes investing look REALLY easy, and gives a false sense of security just seeing the markets continue to inch higher and higher, every single month. But, VERY few people can actually follow this method when prices are going down.\n\nI\u2019m just concerned that, lately, it\u2019s become so easy to be disillusioned with record-setting profits, that during a REAL downturn, people won\u2019t know how to behave or prepare. Especially at a time where unemployment goes up, profits go down, and jobs become harder to come by\u2026it\u2019s going to test a LOT of people\u2019s endurance, and whether or not they will be able to come out of this a better investor. \n\nEven though NO ONE knows what will happen, or how quickly this will blow over, or how much worse this will get\u2026do your best not to worry from spooky headlines, and continue investing as normal. Now is the time for you to double down on your work, take on as many side jobs as you can, focus on bringing in consistent income, building up your safety fund, and buying into the markets consistently. I\u2019m sticking with the philosophies that I\u2019ve talked about here on the channel for over 3 years, now\u2026and, really, absolutely NOTHING changes. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Instead, real estate values are largely driven by the age old saying: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. Real estate prices are heavily influenced by specific market conditions of demand, proximity to employment, and current supply of inventory\u2026this will vary DRAMATICALLY from Location to Location, not necessarily by what\u2019s going on with the overall economy. \n\nSecond, Real Estate values will be HEAVILY influenced by how high\u2026or low\u2026the mortgage interest rates are\u2026.and, right now, they\u2019re INSANELY low. The FED just dropped rates a half a point, and they\u2019re expected to lower rates even further, which happens to make Real Estate wayyy less expensive to own. \n\nAnd third, GENERALLY speaking\u2026people aren\u2019t buying and selling homes multiple times a day like they might do with stocks. The MAJORITY of people buy real estate with the intention of holding it a very long time, meaning that the value of their home doesn\u2019t make much a difference in the short term. Not only that, but valuing the specific price of the home is rather complex\u2026so, for that reason, we don\u2019t notice a huge swing in prices between one home to another. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk stocks. I think that IF we end up seeing a big correction coming in the near future, and prices drop further\u2026I\u2019ll probably ramp up my contributions a little bit, but otherwise, everything stays the same. I know there\u2019s been some talk about investing in Bonds, Gold, or trying to Short the stock market\u2026but, honestly, that just seems a little unnecessary for me, and most people would be best off just dollar cost averaging into the markets, and letting their money sit. \n\nSo, as far as where I think stocks will go from here\u2026I don\u2019t know. No one knows. It\u2019s pretty irrational, but all we can do - based on the last 100 years of stock market data\u2026is just to continue buying, and eventually, things will rebound. \n\nAnd that leaves me with my \u201cRecession Proof Investing Plan\u201d - one, continue to hold and buy real estate, which won\u2019t typically fluctuate much in price, and even if it does - data shows that rents remain fairly consistent, regardless of what happens - and, really, that\u2019s all I care about at the end of the day. \n\nSecond, I\u2019ll continue buying into the stock market as usual\u2026it\u2019ll be a mix of US Equities, International Stocks, and Bonds\u2026.and that\u2019s it. This is all meant to be money I won\u2019t be needing for the next 20-30 years, so whatever their values are before then doesn\u2019t make much of a difference, since I won\u2019t be cashing out. \n\nAnd, third\u2026I always make sure to keep a big safety fund on the side. And, if you don\u2019t currently have that\u2026then that\u2019s something you should immediately be working towards. \n\nAnd I know that even if the markets DO go down\u2026only invest money you don\u2019t need for the long term, only buy properties that you can afford, where the rental income could sustain all of your payments, and only get fixed, low interest, long term mortgages.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Cash is, by far, the most effective\u2026so, empty all the money from your bank account and then fan it out for everyone to see. That\u2019s the easiest way to build a credibility and authority with your audience. \n\nTwo, TELL people how amazing your life is. Whether you travel, drive fancy cars, or spend money like the government is about to seize your bank accounts and you need to get rid of the evidence ASAP\u2026that helps drive more traffic to your page. \n\nThird, keep people wanting more\u2026so, promise you\u2019ll be teaching them how THEY, TOO can have a lifestyle as amazing as yours\u2026and all they need to do is like the video, tag 3 friends who also want to be millionaires, share it with everyone on their Facebook page, and follow. There, easy! \n\nFourth, keep reminding everyone how cool your lifestyle is by posting more cash, more travel, and more cars\u2026that way, they\u2019ll keep tagging more friends! \n\nAnd lastly\u2026TIk Tok is probably not the best place to learn about financial advice. In my honest opinion, there\u2019s some decent content on there - and there are certainly some worthwhile people to follow. But, we have to remember that the demographic on TIk Tok is different from YouTube, so in order to get them all hyped on being an entrepreneur, you need to be extremely quick to the point, otherwise no one will watch you.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFIRST: Invest in your career\nIn your 20\u2019s, the \u201cBEST PURCHASE\u201d is all about INCREASING YOUR INCOME. That\u2019s it\u2026I really believe your 20s are a time for you to work diligently, don\u2019t be stupid, be smart with your money, stash away as much in investments as possible, and solidify the foundation in your career. After that, it\u2019s all about GROWING and MAINTAINING that career...so, that - one day - your investments will be able to cover your day to day lifestyle without you ever needing to work another day in your life, ever again - unless you want to. Also, go and read the books Think And Grow Rich - The 4 Hour Work Week -  and Rich Dad Poor Dad. Trust me, I\u2019ve read all of those books MULTIPLE times\u2026and that\u2019ll be enough to get the ball rolling, and get you so amped up on what\u2019s in store for the future. \n\nSECOND: A Reliable, Used Car \nI never could understand why people my age were out there, buying or leasing expensive cars, when they could use that same payment towards BUYING something that they\u2019d be able to own outright within a year. Which is why I strongly advocate - for anyone who\u2019s in their 20\u2019s - put your own pride and ego aside, and get a solid used car that won\u2019t depreciate, that doesn\u2019t break down, and just gets you from point a to point b safely. You have your entire life ahead of you to go and get cool cars. \n\nTHIRD: Hire a good CPA\nTaxes are INSANELY complicated, WAY more than they EVER should be. Not to mention, there\u2019s a lot of the tax code that\u2019s completely open to interpretation\u2026so, if you want to make sure you\u2019re maximizing the benefits of everything you\u2019re allowed, WITHIN THE LAW, of course\u2026hire a good accountant. My philosophy is that, when it comes to this\u2026a good CPA to help file your tax return will generally, AT MINIMUM, pay for itself.\n\nFOURTH: Purchase Stocks and Index Funds within a Roth IRA \nThis is a retirement account where you can contribute $6000 Per Year and invest after-tax money, and then all of the profit within that account is COMPLETELY tax free after the age of 59.5. The MASSIVE advantage to doing this is that ALL the money you deposit into this account will grow entirely tax free. This is something I started in my early 20\u2019s, by opening up a Roth IRA - and then just loading up on Vanguard Index Funds. \n\nFIFTH: Buy Real Estate\nWhen it comes to myself, those early real estate purchases ABSOLUTELY changed my entire outlook on not only investing, but being able to see the rewards of diligent hard work and sacrifice. It was such an incredible feeling to look at a house, and know that I\u2019m the owner\u2026that THAT ownership was the result of so many late nights, so much hard dedication, so much self doubt, and seeing it right in front of me just made it all feel \u201cWorth it.\u201d Like, in personal finance\u2026we don\u2019t get trophies\u2026but, we can get real estate. And that\u2019s how it felt, to me. \n\nSIXTH: House Hack\nHouse Hacking is a term where you buy a property that has multiple units\u2026then, you move in ONE of them, and rent out the others to cover the cost of owning the building. This is something I began doing a few years ago\u2026and, I gotta say\u2026it\u2019s been one of the best financial experiences. This has allowed me to save a CONSIDERABLE amount of money, it\u2019s allowed me to re-invest WAY more in other things that are more profitable than a housing payment, and I get to invest and own real estate at the exact same time. \n\nThose are the BEST financial purchases to make in your 20s, and everything that I have personally done, that\u2019s helped bring me here today. I really believe that your 20s are such a unique time to get yourself ahead, and whatever you do RIGHT NOW will multiply by leaps and bounds by the time you\u2019re older. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nGet 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFIRST: REDUCE YOUR SPENDING\nimmediately go and sign up for a budgeting software like Mint.com or PersonalCapital.com. You can also use a paid program like YouNeedABudget.\n\nPART 1, you\u2019re going to link your accounts and then review ALL of your spending throughout the last 60 days and identify those charges. \nPART 1 is going to be MANDATORY SPENDING. \nThis is going to be the bare minimum amount that you NEED to live on, no matter what happens. \n\nNext, PART 2 is going to be your DISCRETIONARY SPENDING\nThis is EVERYTHING you WANT to have, but don\u2019t absolutely NEED to have. \n\nPART 3: I want you to CUT BACK ON ALL NON ESSENTIAL DISCRETIONARY SPENDING THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN LIVE WITHOUT. \n\nLAST\u2026PART 4\u2026.SAVE THE DIFFERENCE.\nDoing this is all about identifying what you don\u2019t absolutely need, cutting back on what doesn\u2019t matter, and then saving the difference for where it matters the most. The last 2 months of your spending is going reveal a LOT about your unconscious spending habits, and the first phase of being able to save more money during turbulent times, is to recognize those charges and cut them back as soon as you can. T\n\nSECOND: SAVE THE DIFFERENCE\nThe FIRST, MOST IMPORTANT USE of your money is to build up your Safety Fund. This is basically going to become your insurance policy in case you lose your job, can\u2019t afford to keep up with your MANDATORY expenses, don\u2019t want to sell your investments now at a loss, and need something to fall back on\u2026this is it.\n\nNow, in terms of WHERE to put your emergency fund\u2026you want to make sure it\u2019s somewhere safe, and PREFERABLY, somewhere that pays you a little interest. And, for that\u2026we have the almighty HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNT.  \n\nIn addition to this\u2026if you want a SLIGHTLY better return and don\u2019t need the money immediately, your next option is a CD. \nThis stands for Certificate of Deposit, and this is basically a savings account with a fixed date of withdrawal. The entire point of this step is just to keep your money easily accessible, liquid, and stable during a time where you might end up needing it the most. \n\nTHIRD, I just want it in here, that if you have any high interest rate debt...like credit card debt\u2026.now is the time to pay that off, so you don\u2019t accrue EVEN MORE interest that\u2019ll make your situation worse than it needs to be. \n\nFOURTH, You\u2019ll need to do your best to KEEP YOUR JOB, Take on side hustles, and CONTINUE WORKING, if at all possible. \nRight now, I really, truly believe that you should do everything you can to go above and beyond with your work, maintain the best relationship you can with your boss and co workers, and make yourself as indispensable as possible. \n\nAnd FIFTH\u2026once you\u2019ve made sure your job is secure, your emergency fund is in place, and you\u2019ve maximized how much money you\u2019re making\u2026you should begin consistently investing back in to the markets. \n\nNow, as far as WHAT you should be investing in to \u201cprotect\u201d your money within these accounts, I personally prefer a few options:\n\nOne, is going to be cash. This is just the money you have sitting on the sidelines, so that you take advantage of any good buying opportunities that happen to come up. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m going to recommend the usual index funds. \n\nThird, you could also mix in a Bond Index fund within your portfolio, as well\u2026like VTBLX. This should see a lot less volatility, prices should remain way more stable than stocks.  \n\nAnd fourth\u2026I\u2019m sure people want me to throw GOLD into the mix here, so I\u2019m going to mention\u2026GOLD. \n\nThat\u2019s why, I believe\u2026the best way to protect your money, is to do your best to stay employed, take on any additional work you can, cut back on expenses, and SAVE THE DIFFERENCE\u2026so, that way, you can ride this through and come out the other side unscathed, and completely profitable. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Not to mention, if we include the 1929 Stock Collapse\u2026our average bear market has seen a loss of 41%, over an average period of 1.4 years. \n\nAnd when it comes to something like this, there\u2019s a saying out there that: every bull market is the same, but every bear market is different\u2026and that\u2019s ESPECIALLY true with something like this. \n\nIn each stock market collapse, it could be argued that \u201cthis time is different\u201d - and, indeed, it IS different. No two bear markets are going to be the same, and once we run out of UNKNOWNS for what will happen in the markets - I believe stocks will begin to rebound. \n\nThat\u2019s certainly NOT to say it can\u2019t drop even more, and it might\u2026BUT, for anyone who has ever commented or wished that they had the means to invest during the 2009 Recession\u2026well, in a way, now is your chance. I don\u2019t say that to disillusion anyone or to give a false sense of security, BUT\u2026objectively, if we look back at every single other crash\u2026things have gotten better, and they have recovered. I have no doubt that, eventually, that will happen here, as well.\n\nAnd, as far as my own thoughts on this\u2026I\u2019ll be honest, it\u2019s scary reading headlines. It\u2019s easy to wonder about how bad things will get and set yourself up in a state of worry. ESPECIALLY if your\u2019e staying at home, not going out, cooped up inside, and spending all of your free time worrying about possible scenarios\u2026NO WONDER people are losing it. So, for that, I just recommend you take a step back\u2026realize that, long term, everything is going to be okay\u2026put yourself, first, and continue carrying forward.\n\nI DO worry about the ripple effect this will have on our economy if it persists for longer than a few more months\u2026if that happens, I feel like consumer spending will be changed for the near future as people aren\u2019t working and don\u2019t having enough money to pay bills\u2026and I think it\u2019ll take awhile for people to feel comfortable spending again. But, for ANYONE who isn\u2019t within a few years of retirement\u2026especially if you\u2019re young\u2026from an investment standpoint, now is a great time to continue buying in, and dollar cost averaging as usual throughout this entire experience. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Each eligible adult will receive up to $1200 from the government, and the amount would go up by $500 for every eligible child in the household. Married couples can receive $2400 up to an annual income of $150,000, as well. \n\nThis package also includes a MASSIVE expansion of unemployment insurance, which increase the maximum unemployment benefit by $600 per week, to ensure that laid-off workers, on average, will receive full pay for FOUR MONTHS. This could be EXTREMELY valuable, especially considering that GIG WORKERS are now be eligible to take advantage of this benefit - something that\u2019s never been done before. \n\nIn addition, the plan also calls for a MASSIVE Cash Infusion for the Health Industry of $130 Billion Dollars. \n\nStates and Localities are also set to receive another $150 Billion Dollars to set up further infrastructure to help get them through.\n\nA LARGE chunk of this money goes back into businesses\u2026.one, is that this package reportedly includes a $367 Billion dollar Fund for the small business loan program. \n\nThere have also been talks that, while many of these loans WILL have to be repaid, there will be interest free options, and companies with 500 or fewer employees could tap up to $10 million dollars each in forgivable small business loans to keep the paychecks flowing to their employees\u2026MEANING, if companies oblige by the terms of the loan for a set period of time\u2026they don\u2019t have to pay them back. \n\nNext, is a $500 BILLION DOLLAR Loan for larger businesses who were hit hard, like the Airline Industry. Now, part of the stipulation with this is that - if these larger companies take the bailout money - they will be PREVENTED from using any money to buy back their own stocks for the first year, or use it towards executive bonuses. This loan will also be heavily scrutinized and monitored to make sure it\u2019s being put to appropriate use, as well. \n\nAnd, as far as the impact goes to our entire economy\u2026obviously, so far, the stock market likes it, and it\u2019ll only be a matter of time to see how this plays out long term. It would make sense that, perhaps we start to see further inflation, as more money gets pumped into our economy.

Add me on Instagram: GPStephan\n\nLAST CHANCE - Get 2 Free Stocks on WeBull when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:\nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nTHE FIRST thing you should do is open up a HIGH INTEREST BANK ACCOUNT that pays you over 1% in interest, and deposit the entirety of that check within that account. \nI personally use Ally Bank, they\u2019re one of the very few banks out there that still hasn\u2019t dropped below 1.5% interest\u2026so, for that, they\u2019re pretty good. Discover Bank and American Express Savings are also both REALLY good, which relatively high interest rates, all things considered\u2026so, between those 3 options, you should be set. This is going to be the place where you keep your money safe, short term, until you ACTUALLY need it. \n\nSECOND - YOU SHOULD USE THIS MONEY TOWARDS ESSENTIALS, IF YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO. \nThe most important thing right now is that you have food on the table, you\u2019re safe, your family is safe, etc. Buy food, make sure you\u2019re healthy - and STAY THAT WAY. Even if you think you might not need it\u2026you never know. I\u2019d probably advocate not using this money towards anything that isn\u2019t absolutely 100% required for your own well being. \n\nTHIRD - if you have the essentials already, and you\u2019ve got some money in the back\u2026it might be a good idea to use this $1200 towards your safety fund, and just keep a little more in cash to see you through. \nI know this might seem like a very Dave Ramsey thing to do, and play it CAUTIOUSLY safe\u2026but, I\u2019d hate to see people invest this money, have their investments drop in price, and then have to cash out if something happens and they need to put food on the table. Like I said, being a little more cautious at this point is probably going to be a smarter use than investing\u2026and if $1200 will make a significant difference, just apply it towards that and leave it alone for the next few months. \n\nFOURTH - If this is just a \u201cbonus \u201c $1200 back to you\u2026well, congratulations, you\u2019re in a great spot financially, and at this point\u2026you COULD spend the money, or invest it. \nIf it were me\u2026I\u2019d say you\u2019d probably get a better ROI spending this money by re-investing it back into yourself, since\u2026probably\u2026you\u2019ll have a lot of extra free time on your hands with everything closed. Like, if you\u2019re inside\u2026now is the time to spend some of that money on some weights so you can exercise at home. Or, pick up an instrument to learn\u2026or, learn a new language online\u2026or, take some online classes to improve whatever skills you want to take up. Even go and start making YouTube videos since more people are home and spending their time online. \n\nAnd fifth\u2026I guess, IF you\u2019re going to invest it\u2026invest it. \nI\u2019m a little more cautious about giving this advice, because there are a lot of unknowns with regard to how long this is going to last, how many people are going to be out of work, and for how long\u2026but, hey, if you invest it and you\u2019re already in a good spot financially, then be my guest. As far as WHERE to invest it, you know me\u2026I\u2019m a fan of Index Funds, and I almost never give suggestions of individuals stocks to buy. But, if you\u2019re going to invest\u2026I\u2019d probably suggest doing it within a Roth IRA, that way - you get some good tax advantages later in life, with all of those profits being tax free. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

But, when you lock in a rate like this\u2026the bank is agreeing to give YOU a promised rate, but the BANK doesn\u2019t know what the ACTUAL rate is going to be at the time you actually close the loan. So, because the bank doesn\u2019t want to lose money in the event interest rates change\u2026they\u2019ll hedge their investment but making the reverse bet of whatever YOU do. So, they do this by SHORTING Mortgage Backed Securities. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026when the FED steps in and says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry guys\u2026we\u2019re going to guarantee these loans, nothing to see here!\u201d - it drives interest rates DOWN, causing the price of these mortgage backed securities to go UP - causing banks to lose a LOT of money on their hedged, short positions, betting that the prices of these investments would go down. \n\nSo, banks go and put up more capital to offset those losses\u2026that means, less money they can lend to consumers\u2026and, from there, a problem arises when less money flows back into the economy to people like you and I. \n\nBut then, there\u2019s one more layer of complexity with this whole situation\u2026somewhat on topic of what we talked about, but it\u2019s another potential issue that I\u2019ve been been seeing on multiple articles lately\u2026and that\u2019s missed mortgage payments.\n\nPart of the relief package includes potential mortgage payment forbearance of up to 180 days, with another possible extension of an additional 180 days beyond that.\n\nHOWEVER\u2026even though YOU aren\u2019t making the payments on your mortgage, the mortgage servicer - or, the ones who handle and process those payments - are still on the hook for paying what you don\u2019t. They\u2019re obligated to keep the money flowing into those mortgage backed securities, the same ones which were bought by investors who want a safe and stable return on their money. \n\nAnd that poses another problem\u2026if a significant amount of people hold off from paying their mortgage, how much will these loan servicers be out, and how long can they stay afloat during a time where they\u2019re obligated to continue making payments? \n\nIf you\u2019re in a position to invest money, then - sure - you might be able to buy something at a lower price. And, if you\u2019re SELLING your home, it could be slightly more difficult to get a high price, and a buyer who\u2019s fully qualified to close on the loan. \n\nBut, this is most likely going to affect smaller, more vulnerable banks in the short term than it is going to affect you and I directly. Again, JUST MY OPINION HERE. \n\nAnd now - at the very least - I hope this provides some context and explanation for what\u2019s been going on, so the next time you read a headline about the mortgage crisis - you have some background, and can stay better informed and kept up to date. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The United States has done their best to maintain a safe, stable, and consistent amount of inflation annually, that - over the last 25 years, has generally hovered around 2-3% per year. \n\nFor some people, that\u2019s great - it means that inflation causes certain assets, like stocks, commodities, and real estate, to rise in value with inflation\u2026so, if inflation goes up 3% in a year, so does your investment. Other people say moderate inflation is necessary to keep our economy going, because - if we KNOW our money is going to lose a little value every year - it encourages us to either spend or invest it back into our economy, which keeps us growing. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026other people could see inflation as a negative, because - if they\u2019re holding onto VAST sums of cash, their money will have less and less purchasing power every year they don\u2019t spend it. It also means that those very same stocks, commodities, and real estate will cost MORE to buy in the future as they rise in value with inflation\u2026and that means, you\u2019ll need more money to buy them.\n\nBut, overall - in MODERATION, a STEADY, CONSISTENT inflation rate is generally seen as a healthy indicator of our economy, because people know what to expect, businesses can plan accordingly, and it\u2019s slow enough that most of us won\u2019t notice any major change day by day. That\u2019s why the United States tries to aim for as close to 2% annual inflation as possible. \n\nWe can also look back just 11 years ago to the stimulus passed in 2009, known as the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act. This, at the time, was a nearly $800 billion dollar stimulus to help lift us through the Great Recession\u2026and during that time, if we look back at news articles posted around 2009 to 2011\u2026the worry was runaway INFLATION.\n\nExcept, we look back, the HIGHEST inflation we ended up seeing was during 2011, as our economy started recovering\u2026and that, at its peak\u2026was 3%. Then, the years after that\u2026were under 2%. \nhttps:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/u-s-inflation-rate-history-by-year-and-forecast-3306093\n\nAnd because there\u2019s not too much data that I can pull from such an event like what we\u2019re seeing today, combined with the lack of previous stimulus packages...there\u2019s not too much we can rely on. But, expecting events of such extreme hyper-inflation are pretty much not going to happen in the United States and North America. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

It\u2019s the one that guarantees $1200 checks to every American earning under $75,000 per year, it extends unemployment benefits by an extra $600 per week\u2026and if also gives small businesses the ability to receive an IMMEDIATE, NON RE-PAYABLE $10,000 ADVANCE to use towards maintaining payroll, making the rent or mortgage payments, or having to cope with increased cost of goods due to the current state of our economy. \n\nHowever, when this money didn\u2019t show up - there was a lot of confusion. Here\u2019s what I found:\n\nFirst, Steve Bulger, who\u2019s the director for the US Small Business Association, said recently that:\n\u201cwhether you get the full $10,000 depends on the size of the business. If you have 10 or more employees, you will get it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how many businesses actually received it, he replied:\n\u201cOnce we give approval at the SBA, it will be sent over to the Department of Treasury, who will disburse the advance to the small business owner. So I don't know if any businesses have received their money yet.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/www.bizjournals.com\/philadelphia\/news\/2020\/04\/01\/sba-mid-atlantic-boss-talks-interest-rates-loan.html\n\nSo, given this context\u2026if you\u2019re self employed, working for yourself\u2026according to him, you\u2019re unlikely to get the full $10,000\u2026and the \u201ccatch\u201d here, is that the verbiage says: \u201cUP TO $10,000\u201d - meaning, that\u2019s the MOST you\u2019re eligible to receive. And, chances are\u2026with soooo many applications, and the need for money IMMEDIATELY\u2026these applications are NOT going to be manually processed, and have to be automated to get the money out as soon as possible\u2026so, where it is?\n\nWell, the honest answer is\u2026no one knows. Even though the application page said 3 days from application, the SBA just came out TODAY and said that \u201cEIDL Loan advances will start to be distributed this week.\u00a0\u00a0$1000 per employee up to $10,000 max.\u201d - so, if you\u2019re just applying as a sole proprietor without any other employees\u2026well, looks like your relief check will be limited to $1000 per employee. That\u2019s QUTIE different than the $10,000 that was IMPLIED over a week ago when the entire platform went live. \nhttps:\/\/content.govdelivery.com\/accounts\/USSBA\/bulletins\/284f240\n\nAnd really, when it comes down to it\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise, the entire package was rushed out in a hurry and - in the SBA\u2019s defense - they probably had to scramble around to figure out what they were actually going to do and how they were going to find a way to disperse $10,000 to anyone who asks for it\n\nI have a feeling you might have the ability to further CONTEST the amount that you\u2019re given, if you\u2019re unhappy with it. Who knows if that\u2019s going to be an uphill battle or even worth your time, but it\u2019s worth a shot. And, for anyone further upset by this\u2026it seems like Twitter if your best place to go, by Tweeting the SBA and requesting this be clarified as soon as possible. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

HOWEVER\u2026I think the kicker here is that, once things open back up\u2026many businesses will start to see less demand, because people just won\u2019t be spending as much money, because they have savings and bills to catch up on\u2026and, because of that, businesses won\u2019t be as busy, and won\u2019t need to hire as many people as before. \n\nThird, even AFER all of this subsides\u2026people are STILL going to be in a financial mess.\nThey will still have bills to pay. They still have rent. They still have mortgages. And stimulus money will only last for so long until people are on their own again, and expected to pick up the pace to make ends meet. At this point, it\u2019s unclear how quickly that is going to come and how soon we can return to normal. \n\nAnd fourth, we really have no idea how much is already \u201cPriced In.\u201d\nYou guys know the saying\u2026buy the rumor, sell the news? Well, that\u2019s a bit applicable here. The stock market doesn\u2019t care about what\u2019s happening RIGHT NOW\u2026it cares about what MIGHT happen in the future. \n\nHowever\u2026to counteract some of these, here are reasons why the stock market could recover:\n\nFirst, at some point, people will return back to work, and in a few years - this would be a thing of the past.\nIf you\u2019re investing your money without the expectation of using it immediately, it doesn\u2019t matter if you invest now - or if you invest a year from now - as long as you just invest. \n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve has made it clear that they\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep the economy going, at all costs\u2026\nIt does make you think that, if things get too bad, the FED will step in, get more money into circulation\u2026and stop some of the losses. \n\nThird, the markets have dropped - from peak to low - nearly 40% at its worst, which wasn\u2019t an insignificant drop, by any means. \nThis drop was during a time where - outside of THIS event - everything was otherwise going relatively well. Interest rates were low, people were spending, consumer confidence was high, unemployment was low - and when we take this out of the equation, not too much had fundamentally changed. \n\nFourth, there was already a LOT of bad news priced into the market - so, what else are we not taking into consideration?\n\nFifth, anecdotally\u2026and I say this PURELY from opinion\u2026but, it seems as though there\u2019s a LOT of pessimism out there that the markets WILL go down, and it WILL get way worse\u2026and that almost makes me think that, if the majority of people BELIEVE that\u2026then, it\u2019s less likely to happen. \n\nLesson: Focus on what you CAN control, and disregard everything you can\u2019t\u2026you give yourself MUCH greater power to make the most of opportunities, LONG TERM, without concerning yourself about what the markets may or may not do in the short term. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And that meant, very quickly\u2026the available money was drying up, and there wouldn\u2019t be enough left over for everyone who needs assistance. \nhttps:\/\/www.vox.com\/2020\/4\/7\/21209584\/paycheck-protection-program-banks-access\n\nNow, for anyone who\u2019s unfamiliar with how this works\u2026it\u2019s a loan program for small businesses, who have under 500 employees, to retain their workers during a time where - otherwise - they\u2019d be let go. This loan is given to businesses in the amount of 2.5x their payroll cost, up to $10 million dollars\u2026AND as long as 75% of that money goes towards qualified expenses - like, actually maintaining their payroll, the loan will be forgiven\u2026meaning, you don\u2019t need to pay it back. And that\u2019s where the \u201cFree Money\u201d term comes in. \n\nSo, in an effort to relief some of these concerns, to get money to people who were promised relief within 3 days from applying, but got nothing\u2026they\u2019ve expanded on ANOTHER loan program, called the SBA Express Bridge Loan! \nhttps:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\/coronavirus-relief-options\/sba-express-bridge-loans\n\nAlthough, I gotta say\u2026given how quickly this is rushed out, it\u2019s kinda no surprise that they\u2019re worried about running out of money, and need to ask for another $250 billion\u2026.after all, it\u2019s probably better to have a surplus of too much funding so as not to cause businesses to panic about a lack of funding. HOWEVER, instead of throwing more money at the problem - you\u2019d think it would probably be a much better idea just to use those resources in actually GETTING that money to businesses in need, within the next 5-7 days maximum. \n\nAfter all, what good is an extra $250 billion dollars if no one gets it? Or, if there\u2019s so much confusion that no one knows when or how much they\u2019re receiving? \n\nSo, for anyone wanting an update on their EIDL Loan, or the 2.5 Months worth of \u201cFREE MONEY\u201d from the Paycheck Protection Program\u2026there you go. The good news is that, it looks like they\u2019ll continue funding the program with $250 billion more to make sure there\u2019s enough to go around for everyone\u2026and, Wells Fargo is going to hopefully be accepting applications again\u2026but, who knows when you\u2019ll actually get anything. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

But, by the time this eviction freeze is lifted, technically - you\u2019re going to owe all your back rent, and then - AT THAT POINT - if it\u2019s not paid, the landlord can move forward with an eviction - which, we\u2019ll address very shortly. \n\nBut, to analyze this data PROPERLY, and look at how many people are not paying rent\u2026we have to take a step back and look at this number, in context. Because, in the month before this\u2026and, in the YEAR before this\u2026it was average that almost 20% OF TENANTS to NOT PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME. That\u2019s right\u2026almost 1 out of 5 tenants, in a GOOD MARKET, can\u2019t pay their rent on time. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026here\u2019s what many of these articles leave out:\n\nMany of them failed to mention that the Vice President of the National Multi-Family Housing Council, who were the ones that GATHERED this data in the first place\u2026said that \u201cThe New Data For April With Historical Data is not a true representation of how rent payments are progressing.\u201d \nhttps:\/\/www.bisnow.com\/national\/news\/multifamily\/april-multifamily-rent-payments-fall-to-69-but-improvements-expected-as-month-continues-103823\n\nThe term \u201cNOT PAYING RENT\u201d is counted when tenants don\u2019t pay their rent, in full, by the 5th of each month. And, in April\u2026the 4th was a Saturday, and the 5th was a Sunday, with many places closed from processing payments\u2026meaning, rent probably isn\u2019t going to hit until the 6th, on the Monday, after this data is already analyzed. \n\nSo, even though it\u2019s unclear exactly how many tenants ended up paying rent on that Monday, that were NOT counted in this study\u2026I have a feeling it\u2019s going to cause this 1 out of 3 number to drop, even just slightly. \n\nSecond, I\u2019d also like to mention that these are only tenants who pay ON TIME\u2026and, as a landlord for almost 10 years now\u2026I\u2019ve had quite a few situations of late rent. Sometimes things come up, tenants make partial payments upfront, they pay the rest later\u2026I get it, things happen, and we have to work TOGETHER if we want to get through it. \n\nSo, if you\u2019re a tenant who\u2019s not able to pay your rent\u2026bring that up to your landlord, don\u2019t just stop paying out of nowhere. Even though you\u2019re STILL going to be responsible for payments, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t work out a payment plan with your landlord so that everyone is happy. \n\nAnd, as a landlord, this is also a prime example of why it\u2019s so important not only to screen your tenants thoroughly, to make sure they can afford the rent and aren\u2019t spreading themselves too thin, but also to keep a heft cash reserve on the sidelines for anything that might come up. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Some of the new requirements include: \n\nOne, making sure you\u2019ll still employed, and this is verified 3 days before your loan actually closes. \n\nTwo, they\u2019re only using the most recent bank statements as possible within the last 60 days.\n\nThree, if you\u2019re self employed and UNABLE to show bank statements with proof of income - then your qualifying income, as in - what\u2019s on your tax return - will be reduced by 25%, just to give a little more wiggle room if anything was to happen. \n\nFour, and this is HUGE for real estate investors\u2026Rental Income can ONLY be used if you have a FICO score ABOVE 700, and you can document 6 months of reserves for each financed property in which rental income is being used to quality.\n\nFive, banks have lowered their maximum debt to income ratio - meaning, your mortgage payment can\u2019t exceed 50% of your take home pay.\n\nSix, Bank of America just raised it\u2019s credit score requirement from 660\u2026all the way up to 720 for anyone wanting to cash out of their home equity. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026even though lending is tightening up, here\u2019s where we get into the NEW potential concern of the week: Home buyers NOT making their mortgage payments, and I\u2019m calling for the \u201cMORTGAGE FORBEARANCE TRAP.\u201d \n\nWhat many buyers must understand is that Forbearance is different than DEFERMENT\u2026which is where you can miss a few of your payments, and apply that to the END of your loan. HOWEVER\u2026that\u2019s not an easy process to go through. This is done ONLY on a case by case basis, for pre-approved borrowers, when they know EXACTLY how long you\u2019re not going to be paying for\u2026because, while you\u2019re not paying your mortgage, the mortgage servicer STILL needs to make your interest payments to the fund that now owns your loan. And, the mortgage servicer is unlikely to want to make these payments on your mortgage - on your behalf - without wanting to catch up on those payments upfront, and that\u2019s where the problem lies. \n\nSo, I have a feeling - that, after this forbearance period is up - if buyers are STILL unable to pay, they\u2019re going to be processed through a different application for either a loan modification, which allows for the buyer to add those missed payments to the end of the mortgage, or a payment plan which allows the buyer to make small, extra payments towards paying down the outstanding debt. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

That would be DOUBLED for married couples\u2026meaning, if they make less than $260,000 combined, they would receive $4000 per month. \n\nQualifying families with children would receive an additional $500 per child, up to an additional $1500 per month. \n\nFor every $1000 you make ABOVE that $130,000 and $260,000 income threshold, the total payout will be reduced by $50\u2026meaning, if you make more than $170,000 filing single, or $340,000 filing married - you won\u2019t be getting anything. \n\nNext, these monthly cash payments would not count as income - meaning, this is going to be TAX FREE\n\nAnd, If you had no earnings, were unemployed or are currently unemployed, you would still be eligible.\n\nThis would also apply for college students and adults who are still claimed as a dependent by someone else. \n\nThe language in this bill also extends payments to non-residents of the United States, as well, depending on certain qualifications\u2026and, also allows payment to be made through \u201can electronic transfer application that can be used on mobile devices to receive payments.\u201d\n\nIf passed - these payments would be guaranteed for at least 6 months, and then - if employment levels have not fully recovered - it can be voted on to be extended ANOTHER 6 months. \n\nOverall\u2026this is a REALLY complex matter, and it\u2019s understandable that not even the Senate can come to an agreement on these things with WEEKS of discussion. Ideally, we can come up with a balanced plan that works for everyone, and gives support to people who have been affected by this the most\u2026in a way that\u2019s well executed, and fair to the people who were NOT impacted, and continue to work. \n\nIt\u2019s clear people definitely need more money\u2026but, it\u2019s unclear exactly how much it\u2019s going to be\u2026so, don\u2019t get your hopes up about getting an extra $2000 per month\u2026and, I wouldn\u2019t put too much faith in this actually panning out. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is the update on the progress of the renovation. \n\nAs for the current rental real estate market - \nI have NO IDEA how this is going to impact the rental market, and how difficult this is going to be to rent out. A few months ago, leases like this were almost non-existent, and anything that came on the market was snatched up in a matter of hours\u2026now, I have NO CLUE. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to quite a few people who are holding off from doing ANYTHING right now, even though they WANT to move\u2026which is totally understandable. Not to mention, there are quite a few people already out of work, and many more with their paychecks reduced significantly\u2026so, I literally can\u2019t predict what I think is going to happen here. \n\nPart of me worries that, no one is going to want to move, people will stay put\u2026and I might have to rent this slightly below what I wanted to get. HOWEVER\u2026there\u2019s also the very real possibility that someone might see this unit as a way to SAVE MONEY, and chose to rent it as a cost-effective measure.\n\nBut, I think one thing is for sure\u2026there WILL be a high unemployment rate, people will be making less money this year, and finances will be tight. So, it\u2019ll be in the eye of the beholder about whether or not this is the right value, or not. And, overall\u2026.I\u2019m really curious how this is going to affect real estate values. I mean, we\u2019ll be able to look back at this video from the future and see\u2026.but, I\u2019m definitely keeping everything in mind, and paying close attention because something like this is not good to stay vacant. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This would apply to everyone: \n-All rent payments will be suspended on your primary residence\n-No tenants shall incur any fines for nonpayment of rent. \n-No tenants shall have their unpaid rent be treated as an owed debt\n-No tenants shall be held liable for repayment of debt \n-And, lastly\u2026this unpaid rent will NOT affect your credit score.\n\nSecond, we\u2019ll move on to MORTGAGE PAYMENTS:\n-All mortgage payments will be suspended on your primary residence\n-No home owner will be liable for repayment of those mortgage payments\n-You will NOT be foreclosed on for missing your mortgage payments \n-No fees or penalties will be incurred during this time\n-And not paying your mortgage will NOT affect your credit score\n\nThe Secretary of Housing And Urban Development shall set up a RELIEF FUND for landlords who can be reimbursed for lost rent to offset their cost. To be eligible for this, the landlord must ensure that they follow these guidelines for the next 5 years:\n\n-One, they\u2019ll be subject to a RENT FREEZE - meaning, they cannot raise the rent for that property for 5 years if they accept relief funds. \n-Two, the landlord cannot evict the tenant without JUST CAUSE - or, in other words, you can only evict a tenant for violation of the lease, or eventual nonpayment of rent. You can\u2019t just evict them because you\u2019re tired of having them as tenants, or because they don\u2019t smash the like button for the algorithm. \n-Three, the landlord cannot discriminate against the source of income from the tenant, and during a vacancy, you must make it available to government assistance programs.\n-Four, you can only receive the amount of rent you were getting BEFORE the Illness happened\u2026not after. \n\nFrom there, The Federal Government would create an additional relief fund for LENDERS where they could be reimbursed for the lost mortgage payments during this year. And, there will be another fund set up for housing acquisition, with the purpose of buying multi-family properties to ensure that people have a safe, affordable place to live. \n\nAlthough, as a landlord and real estate investor myself\u2026who also has a mortgage\u2026there\u2019s a lot more to this than the bill is letting on, and I have some serious concerns about how this could be implemented, which I discuss in the video. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

But even though demand has slowed down, production of oil has continued on as usual, even though we aren\u2019t using as much of it. That\u2019s created a SURPLUS of oil that needs to go somewhere\u2026but now there\u2019s not enough space to store it. \n\nWhen you hear about \u2018negative oil prices,\u2019 it\u2019s referring to what\u2019s known as Oil Futures\u2026or, more specifically, the Oil Futures of one supplier in Particular, West Texas Crude. \n\nIn this case, people bought oil FUTURES at a higher price, not expecting things to get so bad\u2026and, as the price of oil fell, it became apparent that those future prices became less and less valuable. So much so, that, because they literally ran out of space to hold all of this oil\u2026it\u2019s cheaper for the people who bought oil futures to PAY YOU TO TAKE IT OFF THEIR HANDS, than it is for them to figure out some place to store it. \n\nAs for whether or not this is going to save you money when you go fill up your gas tank\u2026the answer is yes, and no. YES, lower oil prices will mean that you pay less to fill up your car. BUT, the price of gas you pay is made up of several other costs that need to be factored in\u2026like, distribution, refining, taxes, and then the cost of oil itself. So, all in all\u2026you\u2019ll still pay for gas to fill up your car, it won\u2019t be free, and you won\u2019t get PAID. \n\nNow, for what this means to you and I\u2026well, if this keeps up, some US oil and gas based businesses could go under. Eventually, some companies can\u2019t just run at a deficit forever and will have to close\u2026although it\u2019s unclear where the tipping point will be. Although, if you want to make MONEY from this\u2026well, most likely, you\u2019ll be investing in or shorting oil or gas companies\u2026and when it comes to that, I\u2019ll be honest\u2026I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen, I\u2019m not investing in ANY of this myself\u2026and I\u2019m more curious about the broad implications for the entire economy, than I am about making a quick profit on this. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

MOST people will not be successful. Most people will not become wealthy. But, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t try, and that you can\u2019t do things that will stack the odds in your favor. It\u2019s like rolling the dice ONCE and trying roll a 12\u2026the chances of that happening are 1 in 36, which works out to be almost 3%\u2026but, the more you roll the dice, the higher your chances become of rolling the 12. \n\n\u201cI think getting rich is a fluke, there\u2019s so much luck in it.\u201d\nSo, THIS is the point where I begin to disagree with his statement\u2026because, the way I see it, becoming \u201cWealthy\u201d - which, I\u2019ll define as a net worth over $1 million dollars, for sake of this argument\u2026has very little to do with luck, and much more to do with persistence, delayed gratification, consistency, and time. Now, I don\u2019t want to dismiss that there IS some factor of \u201cluck\u201d that exists, beyond our control, although building wealth is - largely - driven by so many other factors, and according to one of the largest studies on Millionaires, 80% of them are first generation rich, and the majority of millionaires have one single thing in common: they live below their means. \n\nThere ARE actionable, measurable steps that ANYONE can take if they want to become wealthy:\n\nImprove your credit score, save your money, live below your means, open up a retirement account, invest consistently, continue learning, improve your skills, and don\u2019t give in to lifestyle inflation.

So, within those first 6 months - it would cost $2.6 Trillion Dollars, which is almost as much as the previous 3.5 Phases of Stimulus - COMBINED. \n\nSECOND PLAN: Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act of 2020\nFull Plan Here: https:\/\/omar.house.gov\/sites\/omar.house.gov\/files\/Bill%20Text%20-%20Rent%20and%20Mortgage%20Cancellation%20Act%5B1%5D.pdf\n\nThis is a bill that proposes that renters won\u2019t need to pay the rent on their primary residence for 1 full year, regardless of their situation, and that not paying rent will not impact your credit score, or be treated as a debt that you\u2019d later have to repay. The same applies to people who own their own home, in that they wouldn\u2019t need to pay for their mortgage for 1 full year on their primary residence, and that not paying your mortgage won\u2019t impact your credit or send you into foreclosure. It\u2019s not clear if this amount includes mortgage principle, or whether or not this will extend your loan an extra year - but, that\u2019s up for debate. \n\nTHIRD PLAN:  Automatic Boost to Communities Act, known as the ABC Act.\nFull Plan Here: https:\/\/tlaib.house.gov\/sites\/tlaib.house.gov\/files\/Automatic%20Boost%20to%20Communities%20Act%20.pdf\nIt would IMMEDIATELY provide everyone in the United States with a pre-loaded debit card of $2000. And then, every month after that, it\u2019ll automatically be re-loaded with an extra $1000 until one year AFTER this ends. \n\nFOURTH PLAN: Payroll Tax Cut \/ Get America Back To Work proposal. \nRead the plan here: https:\/\/www.hawley.senate.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2020-04\/Getting-America-Back-to-Work_0.pdf\nThis would create a refundable payroll tax rebate covering 80% of an employers payroll cost, up to median wages, as well as create a rehiring bonus for employers to take back on their employees. \n\nAnd even though there are a few other, similar proposals in talks - those are the ones that are most worth noting, and I have a feeling that over the next month, we're going to see these discussed even further, debated, and then restructured in such a way that will finally be implemented for everyone to use. As for a timeline as for when this is going to happen, it\u2019s still up in the air - although, it appears as though they\u2019re all working to get this out as soon as possible, especially if we continue to stay closed down for much longer. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

They also have free ATM access, free debit cards, free checks\u2026the list goes on. \n\nMy number 5 choice: Ally Bank - 1.5% Interest\nThey\u2019re a bank that, in the middle of the FED reducing interest rates, and everyone else racing to the bottom - Ally actually barely budged, and they remained REALLY competitive because they knew that this was their chance to probably get more business. And hey, it worked. \n\nRight off the bat, they\u2019re offering you a 1.5% interest rate on your money with - just like Discover Bank - absolutely no minimums, no hidden fees, no \u201ccatch\u201d - just a solid 1.5% interest rate. Ally has really been the only bank that I\u2019ve consistently come back to after trying almost every bank out there. I also highly recommend their no penalty 11 month CD. \n\nMy number 4 choice: Marcus by Goldman Sachs - 1.55% Interest\nThis company is fairly similar to the previous two I just mentioned, in the sense that they have no minimums, no hidden fees\u2026the usual. HOWEVER\u2026The only downside with this account is that, at the end of the day\u2026this is just a high interest savings account, without access to any additional banking services, like a checking account. \n\nMy number 3 choice: American Express Savings - 1.6% Interest\nWith their account, there are no fees, no minimum balances, and the customer service with American Express has always been topnotch. HOWEVER\u2026just like my last example, keep in mind that this is NOT a full service bank account, so you won\u2019t be getting access to a checking account, checks, or anything else like this. BUT\u2026if you\u2019re JUST looking for a place to stash your cash with a solid, reputable company\u2026that gives you a reasonable interest rate\u2026this one is great. \n\nMy number 2 choice: CIT Bank - 1.7% Interest\nThe minimum deposit for their savings account, to get that rate, is a $25,000 deposit. However, you can use their Money Market account which pays 1.75%. This is essentially the exact same thing as their savings account, except .. no minimums and it pays more\u2026for now. \n\nMy number 1 choice: HSBC Bank - 1.7% Interest\nUnlike a LOT of the other banks I\u2019ve mentioned - HSBC has some physical branch locations, so if you ever actually need to walk into a bank to talk to someone. Now, I will say - the ONLY downside I\u2019ve experienced with them is that their app and actual website are REALLY difficult and confusing to use.\n\nThose are the BEST savings accounts as of right now, that have still managed to keep a reasonable payout - even though the FED has reduced its interest rates down to almost nothing. Do remember, though - that these rates are subject to change at any time, and most likely - I just jinxed it because I made a video talking about it. But, assuming I didn\u2019t ruin it just now - feel free to use these banks and enjoy that sweet, sweet interest. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

After all, at least in the short term - it would be a LOT more devastating if people didn\u2019t have any money, they were shut down, they weren\u2019t working, they lost their house, banks stopped lending, businesses couldn\u2019t stay open, and that - in turn - causes a massive spiral downwards. \n\nAnd given that, though\u2026it does bring up the eventual concern about INFLATION or DEFLATION - because, if so much money is pouring into our economy all at once, while people are losing jobs, EVENTUALLY\u2026that money has to come from somewhere, right?\n\nNow, even though this concern was addressed by a reporter during their press release, and Jerome Powell responded by saying that they\u2019re closely monitoring the situation and will aim to do everything in their power to maintain a steady 2% inflation rate\u2026EVENTUALLY, in my own opinion as some guy on the internet\u2026something has to change. \n\nUntil then, I\u2019d say DEFLATION is likely going to be the biggest concern - my video here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/GRcRmmqByjc\n\nDuring the press release, it was also brought up that The Federal Reserve is essentially \u201cpropping up the stock market\u201d with these fiscal policies\u2026and to that, Jerome Powell responded by saying that (Paraphrased) \u201cThat\u2019s not the main concern, and right now - it\u2019s more important to make sure businesses are able to stay afloat and keep people employed, than worry about the stock market becoming disconnected by reality.\u201d\n\nOnly time will tell how this plays out\u2026but, they\u2019ve made it very apparent that their number one concern is: make sure everything is okay, FIRST\u2026and then, once all of this blows over\u2026we can address potential inflation, paying down the debt, and picking up the pieces\u2026LATER. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

As excited as we get about proposals, it\u2019s too premature to see what actually happens with them and if this actually becomes a reality.\n\nAt this time, it SEEMS like there\u2019s still a strong likelihood of something passing\u2026but, given the comments from the White House today, we have no idea what\u2019s going to be done, or if people are going to be receiving another round of checks. I would NOT be surprised if another $1200 was re-issued, among some other state and local government funding\u2026but I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they took a \u201cWait and see\u201d approach over the next month, and then re-evaluate what\u2019s happening with our economy. \n\nEither way, it leaves all of us somewhat in the dark, without any clear guidance on what to expect, or what\u2019s likely to come from all of this - other than to continue reading new updates that just leave us more confused the longer we read them. \n\nEverything we do will have a consequence later on down the line, and at this point - the best we can do is pick the option that we feel will do the least amount of damage long term. Even though that\u2019s for the house, senate, and White House to debate\u2026it IS apparent that, most likely, something will need to happen - and, until then, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens. \n\nBut, I\u2019m still remaining cautiously optimistic that there\u2019s a good chance of there being SOMETHING happening over the next month or so\u2026although, who knows if it\u2019s going to be as good as getting $2000 per month, tax free. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And the faster the market moves up\u2026the quicker they have to jump in, before they miss the gravy train. \n\nAnd THIS is actually where I\u2019m the most concerned, because - given the recent, new wave of popularity towards finance and investments, combined with the EASE of now investing from your phone, in fractional shares, with as little as $1\u2026I\u2019m worried that there\u2019s an unrealistic expectation where, once something goes down - it HAS to go back up. And I just think, that type of mentality is going to set a LOT of new investors up for massive failure if they either see their investments drop in price - or, if things take longer to recover than they initially anticipated. \n\nJUST because we\u2019ve seen a massive drop, DOESN\u2019T MEAN we can\u2019t see another drop - and, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t trade sideways for quite some time, while your money just sits there doing nothing. So, given that\u2026I think it\u2019s really important to set an expectation UPFRONT - that, anytime you invest, you should invest knowing that NO ONE knows what\u2019s going to happen, EVERYONE loves to guess and predict about things they have no control over, and the BEST guidance is just to BUY, and HOLD as long as you can knowing that, if you\u2019ve diversified enough - you should see a positive return, long term. \n\nReal talk, everyone\u2026that\u2019s the only investment advice I really, truly stand by - because there\u2019s just NO WAY anyone can try to predict what\u2019s going to happen over the next 1-3 years. \n\nBut, quick side note here\u2026in terms of making money and beating the market\u2026what\u2019s even more surprising\u2026and this is so perfect to prove that markets are totally irrational\u2026 is that a study was JUST released\u2026which found the best way to pick a WINNING STOCK\u2026is to find one with a cool ticker symbol ;)\nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/10\/01\/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html\n\nReferenced: Reddit user named jerschneid analyzed the last 40 years of the SP500 and simulated 3 investing styles:\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/BlK4jzM\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/c02ml4\/timing_the_market_the_absolute_worst_vs_absolute\/?st=k4ta6ajs&sh=50d3ef31\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Before then, businesses could write off the FULL amount of a business loss in a given year, which would either cancel out the tax that they would owe against OTHER income\u2026OR, they\u2019d be able to deduct those losses against the previous 2 years, or carry it forward. \n\nBut, when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed, it LIMITED this deduction to max out at $250,000 \/ $500,000 - and this was enacted to prevent people from deducting large businesses losses against their OTHER income - like, from a salary, investment accounts, self employment income, you name it.\n\nBut, the brand new CARES act included a provision that would RETROACTIVELY cancel out this previous tax provision\u2026and it\u2019s as clear as day on page 76 of the CARES Act, for anyone who ever wants to read through it:\nhttps:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/116th-congress\/house-bill\/748\/text\n\nI have a feeling, this CARES act provision was overturned to give businesses more liquidity, and MORE MONEY BACK, during a time where - now - they aren\u2019t doing so well. It\u2019s kinda like giving them a bailout by saying: Hey, we won\u2019t give you cash upfront, we won\u2019t give you a loan or a grant\u2026 but instead\u2026just claim your losses for the last few years, and hopefully that\u2019ll give you ENOUGH money, UPFRONT, to stay afloat, during times like this. \n\nBut, realistically\u2026that benefit SHOULD be applied to ANYONE, even the people who experienced a LOSS in the stock market, and had to sell off those stocks to pay the bills and keep a roof over their heads. Because, YES\u2026this $1.7 million dollar \u201ctax refund\u201d will be applied to SOME businesses that actually need it, and YES\u2026it will be applied to some people who absolutely DON\u2019T need it. \n\nI think\u2026if you open the floodgates to people, without income restrictions, on how much they can deduct NOW - you should open that up to ANYONE who experienced a loss, even regular people, even if it\u2019s a loss of more than $3000 in the stock market. It just seems, to me, to make the most sense. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

If someone loses their job, or begins using up their savings - then typically, credit cards are next in line. And, if people don\u2019t soon get jobs to be able to repay those cards - the payments will then go into default, and that hurts the credit card companies bottom line. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026the downside of this, to you as the consumer, is that - if your credit line decreases, so could your credit score. That\u2019s because 30% of your credit score is made up of your \u201cCredit Utilization,\u201d or - in other words - how much credit you have available to you, versus how much you actually use. \n\nTHIRD CHANGE:\nCredit Cards are offering new different rewards. We\u2019ll start with the American Express Platinum, one of my all time favorite credit cards\u2026and they\u2019re EXTENDING the deadline for the signup bonus by 3 months. In addition to that, the American Express Platinum card is adding a $20 per month streaming credit from May 1st until December 31st when you pay for those services with your credit card. That includes Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, and even YOUTUBE PREMIUM. \nhttps:\/\/www.americanexpress.com\/us\/rewards-info\/retail.html\n\nThe Platinum BUSINESS card will also include an extra $20 per month SHIPPING credit, as well\u2026which comes in handy if you don\u2019t have amazon prime, which\u2026you probably should have Amazon prime. \nALL BENEFITS:\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/churning\/comments\/gbhf6v\/updated_american_express_benefits_and_credit\/\n\nAnother change to a popular card out there is with the Chase Sapphire Reserve which is now offering 5x points on Restaurants until the end of the year. \nhttps:\/\/www.doctorofcredit.com\/chase-cards-to-earn-3x-5x-points-per-1-spent-at-grocery-stores\/\n\nSo, all in all\u2026looks like some credit companies are shifting around their resources to make the user experience better\u2026or, make it so that you\u2019re less likely to cancel something with a high annual fee, because you\u2019re stuck at home\u2026so, for people who have these cards already, it\u2019s just a nice little bonus to get while we\u2019re home watching YouTube and smashing the like button.\n\nTOP 3 PICKS:\n\nThe Chase Freedom Unlimited - NO ANNUAL FEE! AND, they\u2019ll give you BACK $200 when you spend $500 in the first 3 months. So, for anyone who was planning on spending $500 within 3 months, anyway\u2026this is a no brainer. \n\nThe Bank of America cash rewards card - NO ANNUAL FEE! And you get a $200 bonus when you spend $1000 in the first 90 days. Plus you\u2019ll get 3% cash back in the category of your choice, 2% back at grocery stores, and 1% cash back on other purchases. \n\nThe Citi Doublecash is also a REALLY great 0% interest card, and even though there\u2019s no bonus\u2026you DO get 2% cash back, unlimited, on all purchases\u2026and 0% interest for 18 months. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Now, TECHNICALLY - when the FED does this - they\u2019re giving out loans that will still need to be paid back, but because they control the interest rate that they loan money at - they can \u201cEssentially\u201d give these cities, states, and business interest free loans - and the HOPE is that, that money will help everyone stay afloat - and then, when times are good, it\u2019ll get paid back. I\n\nBut where this gets unusual is that - NOW - the FED is going to be buying CORPORATE BONDS, which is another word for - they\u2019re lending money to COMPANIES, not just states and cities\u2026and, even more alarming - they\u2019re buying JUNK BONDS, which is another word for saying - they\u2019re giving companies money, which have a riskier likelihood that they won\u2019t be able to repay those loans back. \n\nAt the end of the day, whether it\u2019s intended or not\u2026when the FED goes on a shopping spree for Junk Bonds, it\u2019s INEVITABLY going to translate into high stock prices alongside with it. When struggling companies get really attractive, cheap financing\u2026that\u2019s positive\u2026and, positive news for companies equates to a higher stock market. . \n\nSince the Federal Reserve has an infinite supply of money, they can afford to do this as long as necessary - and my guess is that they\u2019re hoping that\u2019s enough to get the ball rolling, and then once we\u2019re in the clear - those companies can HOPEFULLY begin to repay back their debts. \n\nThe RISK with this is that there\u2019s absolutely NO MORE market discovery, where companies are naturally left to fail\u2026and, since the federal reserve has no collateral with the money they loan\u2026they\u2019re at the mercy of the company for actually paying them back. If that doesn\u2019t happen\u2026too bad, it\u2019ll be absorbed into our national debt and things will continue on as normal. \n\nThe other concern is that, when we get SO accustomed to 0% interest rates, free money, and unlimited loans\u2026it becomes hard to actually be self sufficient after that. Arguably, prices adjust according based on 0% interest loans\u2026so, when one day interest rates are no longer 0%\u2026if that ever happens, valuations will have to come down accordingly, and that\u2019s a risky move. \n\nWe\u2019re definitely in interesting times now - and, honestly, who knows what\u2019s going to happen. If this keeps up, stocks might absolutely continue rising for the foreseeable future\u2026so, it\u2019s probably in all of our best interest to continue dollar cost averaging in the markets, diversifying as much as we can, and always smashing the like button for the algorithm. \n\nRyan Scribner video: https:\/\/youtu.be\/VnyE2QPeiDQ\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

It has what\u2019s called a GDP, which stands for Gross Domestic Product - and that\u2019s the entire market value of all the goods and services produced within the United States..the purpose of this is to measure the economic output of our country, see if we\u2019re GROWING as a society, and when that number goes up - it tells us that incomes are increasing, and people are spending more. \n\nNow, this is important because - ALONGSIDE that GPS - includes all of that revenue that the country makes to keep itself running. After all, roads need to be built, the military needs to continue running, police and firefighters need to get paid, like buttons need to be smashed\u2026and so on. Now, a lot of those types of services are all paid for through our tax dollars - and, just with any business, there are going to be times where there isn\u2019t enough tax revenue to pay for all the services that we get. \n\nTypically, this is done through issuing bonds and treasury bills - which is just a fancy way of saying: The government will pay people interest if they loan it money. And that loan is guaranteed by the United States, which - lets be real - it\u2019s pretty much guaranteed to pay it back, so people see this as a really, REALLY safe investment. \n\nBut - in terms of who actually BUYS and OWNS this debt: here you go:\nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/heres-who-owns-a-record-2121-trillion-of-us-debt-2018-08-21\n\nSo, here are a few concerns that frequently get brought up:\n\nOne: If interest rates begin to rise, the cost of holding on to that debt become more expensive. Right now, since interest rates are next to nothing\u2026the United States holding on to $25 trillion worth of debt isn\u2019t much of a concern. If anything, it\u2019s BETTER to hold more debt at a time where interest rates are low\u2026than it is to hold LESS debt when interest rates are high - just because, with low rates, that debt is cheaper to keep. \n\nBUT\u2026if interest rates were to be at 4%\u2026that debt would begin draining money from other resources, and when the United States needs to figure out how to raise more cash - the worry is that they\u2019ll do it through higher taxation. \n\nTwo: The other concern is we just carry on as usual\u2026and then leave it up to future generations to worry about. Maybe THEY\u2019LL be the ones that are taxed higher, maybe THEY\u2019LL be the ones with less money spent on public services\u2026or, we can leave it to them to keep kicking the can down a little further until our Grandkids do something about it. \n\nIn terms of whether or not we should be worried about our debt\u2026the answer is, PROBABLY NOT. \n\nWhen we look at our debt in relation to how much money we make\u2026we\u2019re actually a LOT lower than quite a few other countries. You can see here that, sure, we might OWE the most amount of money\u2026but, we also MAKE quite a lot of money, as well:\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_external_debt\n\nSecondly, I think it\u2019s assumed that the plan of action here is to keep interest rates low, and then let inflation do its thing - as long as our economy continues to grow, and innovate\u2026that debt will just sit there, whittling away, assuming we don\u2019t keep adding to it. \n\nAnd really\u2026because of that there\u2019s no REASON to pay off the debt early. Why would they?\n\nHOWEVER\u2026where I see the biggest obstacle, is IF people stop investing in the United States, and we stop growing as fast as we have been\u2026then the United States will be forced to pay higher interest in their debts to entice more people to lend money, and THAT - in turn - would almost certainly mean higher taxes in the future. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Enjoy! Add me on Instagram: GPStephan Click\n\nREAD THE FULL BILL HERE: https:\/\/docs.house.gov\/billsthisweek\/20200511\/BILLS-116hr6800ih.pdf\n\nGet 2 FREE STOCKS ON WEBULL when you deposit $100 (Valued up to $1400): https:\/\/act.webull.com\/k\/Vowbik9Tm5he\/main\n\nJOIN THE WEEKLY MENTORSHIP - https:\/\/the-real-estate-agent-academy.teachable.com\/p\/graham-stephan-mentorship-program\/\n\nThe YouTube Creator Academy:  \nLearn EXACTLY how to get your first 1000 subscribers on YouTube, rank videos on the front page of searches, grow your following, and turn that into another income source: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2STxofv $100 OFF WITH CODE 100OFF \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nSTIMULUS CHECK:\nAnyone making under $75,000 per year will receive ANOTHER $1200 Stimulus Check. As usual, for every $100 you make above this amount, your payout declines by $5.  For MARRIED couples, that amount is doubled.\n\nTHE DIFFERENCE with this NEW proposal, however, is that EACH DEPENDENT is now eligible for an additional $1200 Stimulus Check, up to a maximum of 3 dependents. This INCLUDES college aged and adult dependents. That means, a married family with 3 dependents would receive a $6000 Stimulus Check under this new plan. \n\nHOUSING - RENT:\nThis proposes that there will be an EVICTION FREEZE for 12 months based on nonpayment of rent. AFTER THAT, it\u2019s a bit unclear how it\u2019s written - but, it seems to be IMPLIED that the landlord must give an ADDITIONAL 30 days for the tenant to vacate the property. So, in total\u2026that would give a tenant 13 months to live in the property before an eviction can be filed. \n\nHOUSING - MORTGAGE:\nYou would be able eligible to receive up to 12 months of MORTGAGE FORBEARANCE. This applies AUTOMATICALLY if you fall behind on your payments. In terms of ESCROW ACCOUNTS - where a portion of your mortgage payment goes towards paying the property taxes and insurance, IF you\u2019re in mortgage forbearance - your LENDER would PAY FOR THESE THINGS FOR YOU. \n\nBut what\u2019s even more surprising is a clause in here called LOSS MITIGATION for escrow payments, which says the lender will - at their description, either allow you to defer those payments, or FORGIVE ESCROW ADVANCES. Which, is another word for saying - they\u2019ll just pay your insurance and property taxes FOR YOU, and then NOT expect you to pay it back. All payments can be added to the end of the loan, with no adverse impact to your credit report and credit score. \n\nUNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS: \nThe $600 per week benefits would be extended  all the way until January 31st, 2021. Other benefits include PREMIUM PAY to frontline workers - this would give an extra $13 per hour of PREMIUM PAY for work beginning on January 27th, and would last until 60 days AFTER the last day of the public health emergency. Capped at $10,000 for workers making under $200,000 per year, and above that, the cap is $5000. \n\nSTUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS: \nAs written, The Secretary Of Treasury shall, for each borrower of a private education loan, pay the total amount due for such month on the loan, based on the payment plan selected by the borrower or the borrower\u2019s loan status. The MAXIMUM amount of aggregate payments with respect to an individual is $10,000. \n\nSALT CAP DEDUCTION: \nTHIS bill wants to OPEN THIS DEDUCTION back up again, and allow there to be NO LIMITS on this SALT deduction for the next 2 years, until 2022.\n\nNOW\u2026do remember that, even though this is much more polished, in depth, and FINALIZED proposal\u2026it\u2019s still just that, a PROPOSAL. And IF this passes on Friday, it goes to the Senate\u2026who will then have to pick this apart and vote on it for this to go into effect. So, I think we\u2019re still another few months away from anything happening\u2026but, at the very least, progress IS being made\u2026even though it\u2019s happening slower than a snail gliding through the dessert. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

For the first time EVER\u2026those interest rates just began to go NEGATIVE. \n\nThat\u2019s because the contracts are trading at OVER 100\u2026meaning, at these levels\u2026you would invest $100 and 2 cents\u2026and then get paid BACK only $100, which works out to be a NEGATIVE 0.02% interest rate on your money. And, the longer out we go from January\u2026the more we can see interest rates are going negative. \n\nSo, that lends the question\u2026why would ANYONE ever invest money in something like this, EXPECTING that the outcome is that you\u2019re going to back LESS money than you invested? \n\nThink of it almost like a safety deposit box, where you pay $50 a year to store your valuables\u2026except, now, you pay the government to hold your money and keep it safe, for the small fee of 0.02%.  Now, keep in mind\u2026even though negative interest rates are being priced in to the market\u2026it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s going to happen. Investors right now are pricing in the likelihood of this one day being the case\u2026or speculating that, if interest rates drop BELOW that\u2026they can make some money\u2026but, only time is going to tell how this will unfold\u2026although if it does happen though\u2026here\u2019s the outcome:\n\nIf that happens, it\u2019s going to incentivize people NOT to hold on to their money, and - instead - spend it. The goal is to penalize people from saving too much, and FORCING them to spend or re-invest it back into the markets - THEREFORE, negative rates, in theory, would help lift the economy from that perspective. \n\nIf you think this is absolutely just WILDLY crazy and that this shouldn\u2019t even exist\u2026well, there are quite a few countries that ALREADY have negative interest Raes: Switzerland is negative 0.75%, Denmark is negative 0.6%, Japan is negative 0.1%, Sweden is 0\u2026and so is Spain. \nhttps:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/051415\/5-countries-lowest-interest-rates.asp\n\nThe PROS of doing this is, like I mentioned, it penalizes people and banks who hold too much cash - and it PUSHES people and banks to either lend their money more freely, or invest and spend their money back into the economy to help kickstart growth. \n\nThe downside, though\u2026is that, as we all know lending money is a RISK\u2026and NO BANK wants to take a RISK that the borrower isn\u2019t going to repay back their loan, AND pay that borrower for the privilege of doing so. Which means, if rates go negative\u2026either lenders would STOP lending money, or they would end up charging fees upfront to make up for their loss. \n\nNot to mention, If people take their money out of banks to avoid paying interest, it could also cause LESS money to circulate through our economy.\n\nAnd really\u2026at the end of the day\u2026the purpose behind this is just to AVOID DEFLATION, where our money becomes MORE VALUABLE the longer we hold on to it - or, in other words, it\u2019s the opposite of inflation. When THAT happens\u2026people don\u2019t spend their money, they hoard cash, and that could cause our entire economy to spiral into another endless depression. So, to fight back against that\u2026rates are lowered, people can borrow more, they make less interest on their money so they would rather spend or invest it - and that helps keep a steady amount of inflation, while boosting the economy. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

During times like this, I think it\u2019s UNDERSTANDABLE if tenants wind up needing a few extra days to pay their rent. \n\nHowever - here\u2019s what happened. Even though nearly 1\/3rd of tenants didn\u2019t pay their rent by April 5th\u2026once we count April 6th, just like I predicted\u2026the number of tenants who paid their rent SPIKED UP all the way to 78%. Within a week after that, 85% of tenants paid their rent\u2026and by the VERY END OF THE MONTH\u202694.6% of tenants paid their rent.  \nhttps:\/\/www.nmhc.org\/rentpaymenttracker\n\nNow, of course\u2026when we compare that to LAST YEAR, APRIL 2019\u2026it was found that 97.7% of tenants paid their rent\u2026so, based on one month of data, we\u2019ve only seen an increase of 3.1% not paying their rent\u2026which, lets be real, is FAR from the figure previously reported on. \n\nAs for THIS MONTH NOW, IN MAY\u2026.it was shown that 80.2% of tenants paid rent on time, as calculated by the 6th of the month\u2026compared with 81.7% which had paid their rent during the same time in 2019. \n\nNow, as far as whether or not this trend continues is up in the air\u2026although, to me, it\u2019s not too surprising that so many people continued paying their rent, for two reasons:\n\nOne is how rent payments are structured\nAs it stands, missed rental payments are NOT forgiven -meaning, if you don\u2019t pay, you\u2019re still going to owe the rent at some point in the future - and, even though many counties have enacted a RENT FREEZE which would temporarily prevent the landlord from filing an eviction, it doesn\u2019t STOP the landlord from collecting payment at a later date. \n\nTwo, I have NO DOUBT that the Stimulus and Unemployment benefits have helped, to a certain degree. \nIf people are able to collect an ADDITIONAL $600 per week from the Illness, on top of their normal unemployment benefits\u2026I think it\u2019s no wonder that the amount of tenants who were unable to pay is as LOW as it is, to be honest.\n\nThe BIGGEST elephant in the room here is that the $600 per week unemployment benefit is set to expire on July 31, and\u2026after that\u2026we have NO CLUE if things are going to continue. IF businesses open back up by July\u2026I THINK missed rent payments will be held to a minimum by the time the increased unemployment benefits expire. HOWEVER\u2026IF there\u2019s no new stimulus, AND our economy isn\u2019t opened back up, AND people are still out of work - then I would absolutely expect these rental numbers to look a LOT different, with many more tenants unable o pay. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

After all, if people aren\u2019t spending money\u2026businesses won\u2019t have as many customers, they won\u2019t hire as many people, unemployment will remain high, some businesses might shut down, even more people will be laid off, more people will be competing for the same jobs, that drives DOWN the price of labor, businesses make less money so the stock market declines even more\u2026and now, we\u2019re stuck in a spiraling downtrend of economic mess, all started because people were holding too much money. \n\nBasically\u2026the convention wisdom is: We should all save a portion of our income, and the more money you can save - the better off you\u2019ll be. But, the COUNTER to that argument is: We still need people SPENDING, because - otherwise, businesses don\u2019t do as well, and when businesses don\u2019t do as well, they hire fewer employees - and, when fewer employees are hired, you\u2019ll end up making LESS money - which means you won\u2019t be able to save as much. So, saving money is good for you\u2026but, saving TOO MUCH is bad for everyone else\u2026and that\u2019s where the problem lies. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026in terms of what this means for our economy\u2026we can\u2019t deny that the economy DOES benefit from a surplus of spending...the more money that gets spent, the more it circulates throughout our economy, and the more the entire economy can grow. When the spending stops, that\u2019s bad for business\u2026and bad for growth.. \n\nHowever\u2026if people aren\u2019t spending money\u2026it has to EVENTUALLY go somewhere. And in this case, the more people are saving - generally, speaking - the more money they can INVEST, and the more money they can spend LATER as things slowly improve, which will - again, at some point, end up back into our economy. \n\nAnother benefit is that the more money people save, the LESS money is spent on debt re-payment - the less money spent on bankruptcy - the less money spent on payday loans - and that\u2019s MORE free cashflow that can be left over for other, more valuable and important purchases. \n\nWe\u2019re in VERY a unique time, NOW, where many businesses were FORCED to shut down, many people were FORCED out of work, and it\u2019s unclear how much demand is going to pick up once things begin to normalize. Should businesses re-open, and there\u2019s NO money to be spent\u2026as it stands right now, that CAN be detrimental - and it\u2019s something to absolutely remember. \n\nSo, YES - this is why articles like this point to high savings as a weakness of our economy. After all, the amount of spending and savings is directly correlated with the consumer confidence that they\u2019ll make enough money to pay for the things they buy. When that confidence goes away\u2026they begin saving more money. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026THIS IS A UNIQUE TIME. Businesses might begin to shift more online\u2026restaurants might expand their takeout services\u2026more people could work from home, where retail offices are no longer in demand - and, In the short term, this could be crippling to some businesses\u2026but PROSPEROUS for others. \n\nThis might take some time to come back\u2026and, inevitably, there will be businesses that just can\u2019t adapt. Unemployment could remain abnormally high for awhile. But, I believe, EVENTUALLY, businesses will come back up, and spending will increase for the majority of people, although this could very well change the landscape of how we operate our businesses, where we work, and how we smash the like button for the YouTube algorithm. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

For anyone who isn\u2019t aware what that show is, it\u2019s basically where entrepreneurs pitch their ideas to a group of investors, known as Sharks\u2026and then we get to be the fly on the fall to look into some really bad business ideas, some really genius inventions, and the investor - Kevin O\u2019Leary, always asking for a overly ambitious royalty deal that sends people into tears. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve been a big fan of this show and I found it insanely inspirational to see and hear about peoples businesses, the behind the scenes of how it works, and the investor\u2019s criticism that everyone thinks their business is worth way more than it actually is. And, in the back of my mind\u2026I really looked up to the Sharks on the show\u2026.to me - they were like the pinnacle of success and what you could achieve with hard work and a good idea. \n\nSo, when I found out that Kevin O\u2019Leary was going to react to my episode of Millennial Money\u2026I KNEW I had to react, to Kevin O\u2019Leary, reacting to me. He\u2019s absolutely someone I look up to, and since he\u2019s known a for being the really blunt, mean guy on the show\u2026kinda like the Simon Cowell of business\u2026I knew this was going to be an interesting episode. This is my response. \n\nAnd Kevin: Would love to collab! \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

They found that - in April - we saw a 50% DECLINE of inventory on the market compared to the previous year\u2026meaning, 50% of sellers are holding off from listing their home and choosing NOT to sell. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026NOW, in May\u2026we\u2019re finding only a 24% drop in listings from the prior year, which indicates that sellers are SLOWLY beginning to re-enter the market and list their homes for sale, although there\u2019s still far less inventory on the market than usual. \n\nNEXT - as far as LISTING PRICES are concerned - meaning, the price a seller LISTS a property at\u2026Redfin found that listing prices are UP 5.4% from the previous year, following a 1.7% drop in April that brought the average listing price down to $302,000. \n\nBUT EVEN MORE SURPRISING was the surge in HOME BUYING DEMAND, which has just surpassed PRE CRISIS levels. Now, for anyone unaware\u2026Redfin classifies home buying demand as anyone who reaches out to tour a property, make an offer, or inquire about buying a home\u2026and this shows that there are still people out there, wanting to buy, and waiting for the right opportunity to do so. \n\nAnd\u2026the shock of home buying doesn\u2019t end there\u2026they found that homes are selling at the EXACT SAME SPEED as they were back in 2019\u2026meaning, as of May 8th\u202645% of listings are under contract within 2 weeks, with mortgage applications up 11% from a week earlier. \n\nBUT\u2026with all of that, I\u2019m sure what we ALL want to know about is PRICE\u2026are real estate PRICES going UP, or DOWN? And data from the National Association of Realtors found that home PRICES actually INCREASED in 96% of all Metros during the first quarter. \n\nCoreLogic, one of the largest data analytics companies, found that - even though prices have risen 4.5% year over year\u2026they expect that, over the next year, we\u2019ll only see an increase of half a percent from where we are now. \nhttps:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/insights-download\/home-price-index.aspx\n\nZillow also published their own predictions, which estimated that real estate values would drop 2.7% by October of this year. \nhttps:\/\/www.zillow.com\/research\/prices-sales-forecast-coronavirus-26975\/\n\nHOWEVER\u2026I also want to be a total realist and say this: The reason home prices have yet to be affected, is because real estate prices typically lag behind everything else. In addition to that, interest rates are INCREDIBLY low\u2026so much so, that it\u2019s essentially FREE MONEY for anyone who gets an interest rate below 3.5%.\n\nThe OTHER reality, is that anyone who doesn\u2019t NEED to sell a home, isn\u2019t selling a home. There are plenty of people who were planning to move, but just decide, instead, to hold off\u2026that means less inventory on the market, and with less inventory - combined with low interest rates - housing prices should remain relatively stable. \n\nSo, even though as of RIGHT NOW - housing has barely been impacted - there are a lot of \u201cWhat ifs\u201d that could mean the difference of prices continuing to hold steady, OR the market going down.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Then, the other 494 companies make up the remaining 75% of the value. \nhttps:\/\/www.slickcharts.com\/sp500\n\nEven more interesting, if we look at every company within the SP500 year to date\u2026we can see that 395 of them have LOST VALUE\u2026and the remaining 110 have seen a moderate gain since the beginning of the year. But, that gain is HEAVILY influenced by the largest tech companies that just so happen to be BOOMING right now. \nhttps:\/\/www.slickcharts.com\/sp500\/performance\n\nThe FAANGM stocks have far outpaced and exceeded the growth of the rest of the market, by far\u2026and, over time, they\u2019re becoming increasingly more valuable.\nhttps:\/\/www.yardeni.com\/pub\/yardenifangoverview.pdf\n\nThat just means that - most likely - it could be the new \u201cnormal\u201d that a few large companies lead the majority of the stock market, as they\u2019re able to reach billions of people through the internet - and this type of growth is going to become more common as we become more and more centralized online and with technology. \n\nFor the majority of people out there - a simple broad market index fund is going to be the best option, long term. This means that - instead of going and buying specific stocks - you can invest in ALL OF THEM, at the same time, all in ONE FUND. The benefit to this is that, if a few don\u2019t do so well\u2026most likely, others companies will make up for it. Likewise, if a few do REALLY WELL\u2026you\u2019ll get to enjoy that benefit on a small scale, consistently. Over the long term, it was found that these index funds outperform even the most advanced hedge fund managers\u2026\n\nBUT - Do keep in mind - the REASON the overall stock market has risen so much, WAY more than we\u2019d normally expect - is mainly due to a few specific Tech companies who are doing EXCEPTIONALLY well during the crisis. They are driving a LARGE portion of the market right now, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve seen such a large resurgence in stock prices while many other companies are down. \n\nJust look at Amazon hitting its ALL TIME HIGH as everything is shut down. Netflix also hit its all time high. So did Facebook. And the other top tech stocks aren\u2019t far behind. So, keep that in mind the next time you invest in the SP500\u2026\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Plus, alongside that\u2026many employers are hesitant to tell their employees to return to the workforce, when that mans their employees would be earning less money. At the same time\u2026you can\u2019t just cut out the unemployment benefit altogether, without giving people time to adjust, return back to work, and get situated\u2026so, that\u2019s where THIS plan comes in. \n\nRob Portman suggested that workers should receive a $450 per week BONUS to return back to work, that they can keep in addition to the money they earn working. According to him, \u201c$450 per week represents the amount that would be needed to make a person making the average minimum wage better off in the workforce than on unemployment.\u201d That means that they\u2019d now make, on average, more money working than on unemployment\u2026and that would be the ideal way to shift people back into their work. \n\nIn addition to that, it would put more cash in people\u2019s pockets, it would make employers more likely to see their employees return, and it\u2019s slightly cheaper than giving out $600 per week as it stands now. HOWEVER\u2026there are some downsides with this\u2026\n\nOne, is that this does NOTHING for frontline employees, or employees who were already working throughout the entire crisis. \n\nSecond, is that this doesn\u2019t provide any assistance to those who are living on social security, disability, or retirement income\u2026\n\nAnd third\u2026this does nothing to help people who don\u2019t have a job to return back to. When you begin looking at it from THIS perspective\u2026then it becomes apparent that, even though it\u2019s well intentioned, it does nothing for people who are laid off and can\u2019t find work\u2026.and, arguably, those are the people who are most in need of stimulus. \n\nAt the end of the day\u2026we\u2019re all trying to figure out a solution, but it\u2019s not an easy problem to fix - and there are a LOT of variables that come with this. As of now, the current plan of action seems like: we\u2019ll re-open the economy, wait and see what happens around late June\u2026and then, if it\u2019s absolutely necessary, we\u2019ll CONSIDER dispersing more money. And that\u2019s the main update everyone has been waiting for. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

At the end of 2019\u2026Americans had accumulated $930 BILLION DOLLARS worth of credit card debt, and that works out to be an average of $5700 worth of debt per person. And, just liked you\u2019d expect\u2026when you break that down further, the people who have the LOWEST household net worth are the ones who have the HIGHEST amount of credit card debt, likely because they have no other option than to use a credit card\u2026.and because credit card interest rates can be ridiculously high, it makes it extremely difficult to pay off if you can only afford the minimum payments.  \n\nThe CONCERN is that people dig themselves into more debt by borrowing money, as indicated by the 25% of people who have increased their credit card debt during the crisis\u2026and, when all of this is over, unemployment still remains high, the stimulus runs out, the unemployment benefits run out\u2026and banks are left scrambling when a portion of those people don\u2019t pay them back. \n\nSo, really - at the end of the day\u2026here\u2019s where we stand, and here\u2019s what this means:\n\nFirst, having such a huge number of people requesting financial hardship assistance on their credit card is not surprising. It\u2019s easy to do, banks have made them extremely accessible, and for anyone who\u2019s unsure of their financial future - it makes sense to pause payments, and solidify the essentials before coming back to the credit card debt. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s absolutely concerning that so many people have been faced with financial hardship - and, inevitably, a portion of these credit card users will be unable to repay their debts once this pause-period is up. I certainly expect default rates to climb for the time being, and a LOT of this will depend on how quickly our economy begins to stabilize once people return to work. \n\nAnd third, I think the most likely outcome from this is that - for the next few years - credit cards are going to be more strict about who they give loans to, they\u2019re going to give you less of a credit limit, and they may potentially charge slightly higher interest if they determine that too many people aren\u2019t making their payments. \n\nUltimately, when used properly\u2026credit cards can be a VERY useful tool to leverage your money, build your credit, get cash back, and travel for free - and that\u2019s the reason I like and use them so much.

Companies get more more cash on hand to weather a downturn, they get to sell while people are buying\u2026and even though we COULD see a stock market drop in the future, it doesn\u2019t guarantee prices will go down from here. \n\nSECOND: Wells Fargo and the recent announcement that they\u2019ll NO LONGER be issuing Auto Loans for independent car dealerships. \nIt\u2019s a smart move for Wells Fargo, but a BAD sign that the used auto industry is about to take an even deeper hit, and most likely for the foreseeable future\u2026getting a loan is going to become a lot more challenging for everyone. \n\nTHIRD: Millionaires plan to reduce their spending\nI think it\u2019s reasonable that, during tough times\u2026most people reduce spending and postpone purchases. It's not surprising, either, that many of them think their assets will be the same or HIGHER in the next 6 months. \n\nFOURTH: Nearly two-thirds of millionaires said that it would take the market at least a year to recover back to its previous all time high. \nI interpret this as rather optimistic that the market would rebound so quickly. And while it says that they \u201conly plan to put about a third of their money into stocks\u201d - that\u2019s actually a significant amount of money, with the MAJORITY of millionaires ADDING to their stock position during the decline. \n\nFIFTH: CFO\u2019s believe the DOW will fall another 20% down to 19,000\nAny rational, NUMBERS DRIVEN person can look at the stock market - compare it\u2019s relative value of where it was, versus where it is now\u2026make the connection with our current economic environment, which is terrible\u2026and then make the conclusion, that we shouldn\u2019t be trading at these levels right now\u2026and they would be right! BUT\u2026there is an element to the market that is totally irrational, money HAS shifted to companies with a strong online presence, and instead of trying to go against it - it\u2019s better to be cautious and invest long term. \n\nSIXTH: Real estate saw the biggest monthly gain in 2 years\nHOWEVER\u2026the DECLINE would potentially come once more sellers begin to list their homes for sale\u2026which, could very well happen in hard hit tourism cities like Miami and Florida. And, we could see a drop in sales prices once the reality sinks in that jobs might not come back as quickly as we expect. I\u2019ve mentioned this in a video before, but real estate very much lags the rest of the market, and it\u2019ll likely take us 6 months to see what truly ends up happening TODAY\u2026so, even though there is some optimism here, it\u2019s something to keep a close eye on. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is done on purpose to be able to streamline the production process as much as possible for Tesla, keep overhead low, and build in as much profit margin as possible while they continue growing\u2026and, I think it\u2019s a great strategy. \n\nTWO: GLITCHES \nHalf the time I go to open the car door\u2026it just doesn\u2019t open for whatever reason. So, in order to open it\u2026I have to unlock my phone\u2026from there, it\u2019s another 50\/50 chance of it working\u2026and, if all else fails, I have to sit there while the Tesla app loads on my phone\u2026which usually takes 5-10 seconds\u2026and then, once it\u2019s opened up, the car will unlock. A little minor annoyance more than anything\u2026but, still\u2026I hope this is fixed at some point.\n\nTHREE: PAINT ISSUES\nIn terms of paint quality\u2026overall, I\u2019ll be honest\u2026it\u2019s just okay, and while it\u2019s probably GOOD enough\u2026there are some areas of the car that needed attention. There have also been issues with under-spray between some of the body panels that were missed\u2026.now, in Tesla\u2019s defense, NONE of these are actually noticeable if you aren\u2019t looking for them\u2026but, once you see it, it\u2019s hard to miss. \n\nFOUR: FUNCTIONALITY\nThis car pretty much DOES do it all. Storage is absolutely incredible\u2026you have the front trunk, which I have NEVER actually used\u2026but, it\u2019s cool that it\u2019s there. You also have a HUGE trunk with seats that fold down anytime you haul stuff.\n\nFIFTH: SENTRY MODE\nThe small cameras around the car can used for recording motion, and then storing that footage on a memory card for you to view later.  I WISH\u2026however\u2026that there was an option to LIVESTREAM the Sentry Mode from your phone just to check on things\u2026that way, your car could almost act like a security camera wherever it goes\u2026I also wish you could record audio with this, as well\u2026so, while something is up to no good doing something, you could hear what they\u2019re saying. \n\nSIXTH: THE TOUCH SCREEN\nWhen you\u2019re parked, the entire screen turns into an entertainment console where you could watch YouTube videos, go on the internet, check in on Netflix, etc.. UNFORTUNATELY\u2026to have access to anything that requires the internet, you do need to pay for their data streaming, which costs an extra $9.99 per month\u2026personally, I wish I just had the option to use my phone data and tether that to the car to use.\n\nAND IDEALLY\u2026at some point in the future\u2026I\u2019d like for the touch screen to be customizable, where you can re-arrange the icons depending on your own preference, similar to an iPhone.\n\nBut, on a more positive note\u2026overall, my ownership experience with Tesla has - by far - been INCREDIBLY enjoyable. The minor annoyances are really just that\u2026minor\u2026and, overall, I LOVE the car, and in a way - it\u2019s spoiled me from enjoying anything else. I literally wouldn\u2019t get another car besides a Tesla at this point, just because I like it so much. \n\nThis is the only car, too, that just gets BETTER with time, as weird as it is to say. Tesla constantly releases updates every month or so that improve the features of the car, that increase its mileage, that maximizes its speed, and they\u2019re constantly optimizing\u2026so, this has only gotten MORE ADVANCED since I bought it. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026If I were to do it all over again, I do regret not getting the long range model instead\u2026that would've saved me so much time from having to make extra stops at super chargers. And I should\u2019ve bought the white interior\u2026lesson learned.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Remember this:\n\nONE: Things will ALWAYS be true - until one day, they might not. That includes that the SP500 has ALWAYS been up following the strongest 50 day rally in history. Is this LIKELY to be the case? MAYBE\u2026but, it certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee it, just because it\u2019s always done that in the past.  \n\nAnd TWO: Be VERY cautious of confirmation bias with the information you read online. There will be evidence to support whatever you believe in if you look hard enough - and whether or not its actually true, closing yourself off to other information can immensely hinder your ability to perform well as an investor. \n\nAnd, guys..I get it\u2026my videos like this are repetitive. I don\u2019t necessarily like re-making the same messages over and over again, but sometimes it\u2019s necessary as a reminder for people who forget that this REALLY SIMPLE APPROACH still works. \n\nThis is NOT to say that the market can\u2019t go down another 20% from here\u2026maybe it can, or maybe it goes up another 20%. But, really, none of that matters\u2026when you\u2019re investing your money long term, the price of the stock market between now and the time you retire and need the money is just white noise. \n\nPlus, instead of being FEARFUL about drops like this\u2026you should look forward to them, in a way. When there\u2019s such an intense correction, see it as though you\u2019re getting a discount on EVERYTHING\u2026it\u2019s a Black Friday sale for your money. Like, you wouldn\u2019t be upset if I lowered the price of my YouTube creator academy program by $200 for 48 hours, right? Link down below in the description\u2026of course not, because now you get to save money. Stocks are the same way. \n\nThe ONLY time you should be concerned about this is if you\u2019re within a few years from retirement\u2026in which case, typically, you wouldn\u2019t have so much exposure to the stock market, anyway, and you would\u2019ve allocated a percentage of your portfolio to safer, more stable investments\u2026but, again, outside of retiring and not having rebalanced your portfolio earlier, it\u2019s a good opportunity. \n\nYes, that\u2019s REALLY going to test a lot of people whenever the market drops again - but, it\u2019s shown time and time again, consistently, that holding and continuing to buy in is going to pan out the best in the long run. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

They found that, recently, Stocks trading below $1 per share have had an average gain of nearly 80% in the past week\u2026and much of that movement was caused by retail investors looking to buy beat up companies for a quick profit. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/10\/market-gone-wild-penny-stocks-are-up-nearly-80percent-on-average-in-the-last-week.html\n\nI\u2019ll be honest\u2026this type of investing is beginning to remind me of the CC Bubble in late 2017, except this time\u2026gambling is disguised and justified under the veil of \u201cinvesting,\u201d and even though many of these companies are NOT worthless, and have real value\u2026there\u2019s just the common mindset that you should buy into the hype train and risk money, because someone else will most likely be willing to pay even more, later. \n\nNow, I want to make the distinction that investing in a hard hit company, with solid fundamentals, long term, is NOT what I\u2019m talking about here\u2026but, instead, this gamblers mentality that becomes a game of musical chairs, knowing that a company is about to be worthless, but hoping the price will go up high enough to make a profit, and leave someone else holding the bag. \n\nUnfortunately, I do think that this is going to burn a lot of people who confuse investing with excessive risk\u2026and, if you find yourself in this position, recognize the risks involved, and preferably ONLY play with money that you\u2019re okay with losing. \n\nThat\u2019s why the age old: invest consistently, buy and hold long term, still applies here. Honestly, the entire market is unpredictable and we have NO Idea what\u2019s going to happen in the short term\u2026that\u2019s why it\u2019s better to buy in, and keep buying in on a consistent basis. If prices go down, you buy lower - if they go up, you\u2019ve made a profit, and can continue buying higher. \n\nIf you invest in a broad index fund, much of this doesn\u2019t apply to you and you can grab your popcorn and watch\u2026but what\u2019s going on with some of these individual stocks, like JC Penny, Herz, and even Nikola stock\u2026is just gambling. \n\nAnd sure, there\u2019s the possibility of making a lot of money - but, you could also LOSE a lot of money. So, just remember\u2026even though it might be TEMPTING to throw money in some of these companies for fun, or because you see the price just going up\u2026realize that it\u2019s insanely risky, and NONE of this is sustainable. \n\nIf you have any significant amount of money\u2026just invest normally, max out your retirement accounts with an index fund, and call it a day. If you have money left over you don\u2019t mind potentially risking\u2026go for it\u2026but, don\u2019t confuse that with investing. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And even though high wage earners are more likely to KEEP their jobs - they\u2019re just as likely to receive a pay cut. \n\nThe other bad news, depending on how you look at it, is that they found: \u201cBorrowing conditions are tight for individuals with low credit ratings, but credit remains available to those with strong credit profiles.\u201d Here\u2019s what this means\u2026if you\u2019re someone with money, with a good credit score, who doesn\u2019t NEED to borrow money\u2026you\u2019re going to have an easy time borrowing money, because YOU are less of a risk to banks. On the other hand, if you don\u2019t have money and you don\u2019t have a good credit score\u2026getting a loan is going to be difficult. \n\nSo, overall\u2026here are the main takeaways:\n\nOne, the Federal Reserve is going to watch over the economy and do everything in its power to keep us going - including keeping interest rates at historically low levels. \n\nTwo, they don\u2019t anticipate any issues with inflation because people aren\u2019t spending money, and the savings rate increased to 33% last month. With fewer people spending money, there\u2019s less upward pressure for prices to increase\u2026and no inflation\u2026.for now. \n\nThree, the worst job losses are happening among low-wage employees, especially in service industries that had to be shut down. Even higher paying jobs are seeing pay cuts, although they\u2019re not as severe. Because small businesses employ the majority of low income workers, the FED says that keeping small business afloat will have the biggest benefit to our economy. \n\nFour, getting a loan will be significantly more difficult if you have a bad credit score\u2026and, if you have a good credit score, things will be significant easier for you. So, take some time to begin improving this if you can - this isn\u2019t difficult, and with very little work, you can do a lot to boost your score. \n\nAnd five: they estimate this will take us several years to begin to return to normal. They don\u2019t anticipate jobs and demand coming back immediately, and only time will tell how this plays out. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And the first time in almost EVER\u2026debit cards have begun offering rewards, similar to that of a credit card. \n\nHowever, even though a debit card offering ANY amount of money back is rather remarkable, I do want to say this:\n\nThere are still so many DISADVANTAGES of using a debit card instead of a Credit Card\u2026and it\u2019s for these reasons that I almost NEVER recommend them for anyone to use on a regular basis: \n\nOne, Credit Cards are so much better for security - HANDS DOWN. Even though Debit cards are getting BETTER, they still have a long way to go\u2026anytime you use a debit card, you\u2019re basically giving the entire world direct line to your ACTUAL money sitting in your account - and, in the event of an error or an overcharge, getting your money BACK on short notice can be difficult since the money is taken directly from your account.\n\nThe SECOND reason I never use a debit card is because it doesn\u2019t have the PURCHASE PROTECTION BENEFITS like a Credit Card has. See, many credit cards will offer this as a perk of using their service\u2026and this should be reason enough for you to start charging everything on your credit card. \n\nThe THIRD reason I don\u2019t use debit cards is because the rewards the offers just PALE in comparison to that of a credit card. Like, none of the debit cards listed offer a sign up bonus\u2026and with a credit card, just sign up, meet the minimum spend, get a whole bunch of points\u2026and use that for free travel, hotels, or cash back\u2026all for using this instead of a debit card.  \n\nAnd finally\u2026the last reason to use a credit card Is to boost your credit score and credit utilization. In the United States, your credit score is a huge factor in determining whether or not you can get a loan to buy a house, car, or any other purchase you want to finance\u2026it also determines what interest rate you pay, and whether or not you get a low interest rate, or a high interest rate. \n\nSo I\u2019d like to think ALL of those reasons I just mentioned are fairly compelling just to use a credit card for EVERYTHING, and to ditch the debit card and cash altogether. HOWEVER\u2026there is FINE PRINT to this, where sometimes it\u2019s BETTER not to use a credit card\u2026.and these are my thoughts:\n\nYou should NOT use credit cards to rack up debt IF you don\u2019t have the money to pay it off, in full, when it\u2019s due. You should never pay a single penny in interest, you should never increase your spending just because the money isn\u2019t immediately taken out of your account, and you should have the cash available to pay it off, in full, at all times. Basically, just treat your credit card like it has a direct line to your bank account - if you can\u2019t pay it off immediately or have the money on hand to pay for something, then don\u2019t do it. \n\nThe REASON credit card companies offer such good rewards is because MOST PEOPLE DON\u2019T DO THIS\u2026and it\u2019s PROFITABLE for the credit card companies to pay a small portion of their users really good rewards, just to lure everyone else in who will never use them, or pay a lot of interest.  This IS an opportunity for you to make money off credit card companies\u2026but, you also have to acknowledge that most people WON\u2019T use it correctly\u2026and that\u2019s how companies can keep these rewards going in the first place.

If this gets even worse, it\u2019s SUSPECTED that the FED might even go as far to buy INDIVIDUAL STOCKS of companies\u2026he believes the SP500 could re-test its previous lows in this next month, and at that point\u2026the FED would have no other choice but to buy stocks and take ownership of American Companies. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/06\/16\/investing\/scott-minerd-stock-market-federal-reserve\/index.html\n\nUnfortunately, though\u2026it\u2019s not exactly clear if investors are heeding that type of advice, because now - we have this:  \u2018Cooped-up\u2019 millennial traders have sparked a new pandemic \u2014 it won\u2019t end well, warns Princeton economist. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/cooped-up-millennial-traders-have-sparked-a-new-pandemic-it-wont-end-well-warns-princeton-economist-2020-06-17\n\nHe says, that basically, cooped up millennials are bored at home - and because stock trading apps like Robinhood have made investing so easily accessible with as little as a dollar - people have flooded the stock market in search of easy profits from home, by investing in hard hit companies. \n\nThis is also mirrored by a well known investing Billionaire, who said mom and pop investors in the stock market will \u201cEnd in tears\u201d - and more specifically, he\u2019s warning against people who are speculating in stocks for quick profits. Although, I DO think these very wealthy investors have a point when they warn against stock market speculation.\n\nBut, even with all of that out of the way, there\u2019s also another concern: The value of the dollar could fall, very very sharply. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/the-dollar-is-going-to-fall-very-very-sharply-warns-prominent-yale-economist-2020-06-16\n\nAnd for us as individuals\u2026it\u2019s a little troubling. It could mean that stock and real estate values end up going way up, so for those that are not invested in the market - it\u2019s going to be a lot more expensive to get in. But, again, this is really all speculation\u2026.and it\u2019s yet to be seen if something like this is going to happen anytime soon. \n\nHowever\u2026not even that is dissuading people from holding onto cash at record levels right now. According to The WallStreetJourney, cash in money market funds reached $4.6 trillion dollars, the highest level since 1992. \n\nObviously, the reasoning for this is simple: many wealthy investors don\u2019t know how to navigate investing in such a volatile market where the Federal Reserve can essentially make announcements that move the markets, so they\u2019re holding out in cash while things simmer down\u2026and, I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m in the same boat. \n\nOn a positive note, though\u2026it does show that there\u2019s a LOT of money sitting on the sidelines, and if prices do fall too far\u2026there\u2019s no shortage of people with money to buy back in. So, that COULD be a good sign, in a weird way.\n\nAnd finally\u2026in some odd, kinda good news on top of all of this\u2026the HOUSING MARKET IS ACTUALLY GOING UP. \nZillow has also found more buyers participating in the market, with 50% of offers facing a bidding war to get the property. The reason for this is that there\u2019s less inventory on the market as sellers hold off from listing their home, interest rates are absurdly low, and that\u2019s fueling a housing shortage that\u2019s causing buyers to pay more to get the same home - driving up prices. \n\nAll in all, though\u2026at the end of the day, what this tells us is that we should NOT ONLY have cash on hand to see us through potentially rough times, but also that the safest option is to continue to stay invested in the markets.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

You\u2019ll pay $0 in interest, you\u2019ll build your credit history, and over time, and you can continue adding in new credit cards to the mix. \n\nFIFTH: LIVE BELOW YOUR MEANS\nI\u2019ve found that the older you get - the less \u201csocially acceptable\u201d it is to live like a broke college student, and the less you WANT to live like a broke college student. So, now is your chance to get away with doing all the cheap and frugal things you\u2019ve always wanted to do, before people call you weird for doing them. \n\nSIXTH: TRACK YOUR SPENDING\nYou can\u2019t effectively live below your means without knowing where you spend money, how you can cut back, and figuring out where it all goes. I\u2019ve been tracking every single expense on Mint.com and PersonalCapital.com since 2012\u2026and it\u2019s helped me out a LOT in terms of optimizing my finances. \n\nSEVENTH: TAKE UNCOMFORTABLE RISKS:\nI\u2019ve really found that the WORST place you could be in your 20s\u2026is COMPLACENT. If you\u2019re satisfied where you are right now, but you know - deep down - you aren\u2019t living up to your full potential - the ONLY way to break free from that is to get used to putting yourself under pressure. You HAVE to start making uncomfortable choices and taking calculated risk to get yourself ahead, even if it isn\u2019t the EASY decision to do. \n\nINVESTING FROM THRE:\n-Open up a RETIREMENT ACCOUNT. This is just an account that you can invest within that saves you money on your taxes\u2026for example, some of these accounts allow you to use them as a tax write off, and others allow all of your profit to grow tax free\u2026just depends on which ones you want to use. \n\nRoth IRA: $6000 Per Year Post Tax Money\nTraditional 401k: $18,000+ Per Year Pre-Tax Money\nHSA \/ Health Savings Account: $3500 Per Year Pre-Tax Money\n\nLook into the 3-fund portfolio, and this gives you the ULTIMATE diversification across everything\u2026so, you\u2019re basically just investing in the entire world in the long run - and even if one or two industries goes down, plenty of others will be there to pick up the pace.\n\nNow, in terms of any other investment specifics, just remember this really easy saying: time in the market beats timing the market. That\u2019s it. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Now, on the one hand - missed rental payments like this are NOT forgiven, and just because a tenant can\u2019t be evicted, doesn\u2019t mean that they DON\u2019T owe rent\u2026but, on the other hand, if tenants didn\u2019t have the money to pay rent - why would they, all of a sudden, have the money to pay when the eviction freeze is lifted? \n\nUnfortunately, though - there\u2019s no solution where EVERYONE wins, and it\u2019s going to be difficult for everyone involved. So, that just leaves us with a few options: one, if you\u2019re a tenant: try working out a deal with your landlord. I\u2019ll tell every landlord the same thing: evictions are a last case resort, and while there ARE cases where eviction is absolutely necessary: it should NOT be the main focus. \n\nInstead, as a Landlord - it\u2019s MUCH better, and CHEAPER, to work out a deal where your tenant can continue living in the property, and get on a payment plan to make up lost rent, than proceed forward with an eviction. Logistically, if the eviction freeze is lifted and landlords all rush to get evictions out - the eviction process is likely to take awhile. Courts will be backed up, and unless they find a way to expedite all the claims - it could take several more MONTHS to from start to finish to go through an eviction. \n\nNow, I also get it - owning a rental property is a business, and when you have a client not paying you for your service, you\u2019ll need to demand paying or cut ties. But, this is a unique circumstance where a BETTER outcome for EVERYONE is typically in working out a payment plan and KEEPING the tenant, or working out a reduced rent in order for the tenant to continue paying and living in the property\u2026usually, that\u2019s way cheaper than cleaning up the unit and then waiting for a new tenant to move in. \n\nI also HIGHLY recommend another alternative to evictions - and that would be \u201cCash for Keys.\u201d This is a practice in which the landlord will pay the tenant to vacate the property by a certain date, and this does a few things - the landlord can get a tenant out faster, can re-rent the unit faster, and doesn\u2019t miss out on lost rent - and, some of those savings are passed on to the tenant in exchange for leaving. \n\nIn both situations - whether it be a cash for keys, or working out a payment plan - both sides work together and should HOPEFULLY come to a resolution where everyone is happy. If that doesn\u2019t happen, and there\u2019s a MASS wave of evictions - then the real estate market could be headed towards some serious trouble, not to mention - all the people that\u2019ll be forced out of their homes. \n\nUntil then - it\u2019s up to us to do the best we can to work together to find a happy middle ground - and I have a feeling, payment plans, reduced rent, or a cash for keys option would be WAY less expensive and time consuming than waiting for an eviction in the next few months.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

You\u2019ll also get 1 year of complimentary Lyft Pink when you activate the service using your card - and that\u2019s a $240 value. \n\n4. Next, you\u2019ll also get free priority pass lounge access for yourself and up to 2 guests anytime you travel - and this has a minimum value of $99 per year, all the way up to $399 per year depending on how much you travel. \n\n5. Now, even better than that\u2026one of the unknown perks of this card that I didn\u2019t even know about when I signed up until someone told me\u2026was that it comes with FREE United Club Membership when you request membership over the phone. \n\n6. Sixth, you\u2019ll also get complimentary global entry or TSA PreCheck which works out to a $100 statement credit every 4 years. \n\nAnd 7th through 15th\u2026you just get a whole bunch of other perks and services, like up to $10,000 worth of trip cancellation, complimentary rental car insurance, complimentary roadside assistance, lost luggage reimbursement, free hotel upgrades and services, and even free medical and emergency dental benefits when you\u2019re more than 100 miles away from your home. \n\nNow, in terms of EVERYTHING ELSE though - and how it compares with OTHER credit cards out there - from my experience, it\u2019s definitely BETTER and it has a LOT of improvements - but, it\u2019s not something that\u2019s so crazy or hyped up to be a \u201c$10 million dollar credit card.\u201d \n\nFor example, let\u2019s compare it to the Chase Sapphire Reserve. To get this card, it\u2019ll cost you $550 per year\u2026pretty much anyone can get it if you have a thorough credit history\u2026and it has NEARLY THE EXACT SAME BENEFITS as the JP Morgan Card. \n\nThe American Express platinum also costs $550 per year\u2026but, some of its benefits are a little more niche. \n\nFor instance, instead of giving you a broad travel credit\u2026they\u2019ll just give you a $200 airline credit towards incidentals that you can redeem through one airline of your choice. You\u2019ll also get complimentary Centurion Lounge Access anytime you travel. American Express will also reimburse you $15 per month in Uber Expenses, and that increases to $20 in December. You\u2019ll also get $100 per year to spend towards Saks 5th Avenue. \n\nThey\u2019ve also just recently added on a $20 per month free streaming credit that you could use towards Spotify, YouTube Premium, Netflix, or anything like that through the rest of the year\u2026and a $20 per month Phone Credit when you pay your phone bill through the American Express Card. \n\nEven though the JP Morgan card is almost identical to the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u2026this does come out ahead. It\u2019s got more benefits, a lower annual fee, and better customer service. It\u2019s REALLY easy for this card to pay for itself almost immediately, and everything after that as profit. \n\nMy ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: \nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/shop\/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

One, make sure the bank has no minimum balance requirements Two, make sure they don\u2019t charge you any monthly maintenance fees .Three, make sure they pay you above a 1% interest rate with no minimums \n\nSecond: INVESTING IN A ROTH IRA - https:\/\/youtu.be\/z-53ZTJmDUA\nAs far as where you can open one of these up\u2026I personally like Vanguard, they\u2019re a great company with a long term track record\u2026but places like Fidelity, or Charles Schwab work really well, too. And whoever you use, just make sure they\u2019ve been around for awhile - they\u2019re reputable - and they have an easy-to-reach customer service team. \n\nThird: INDEX FUNDS - https:\/\/youtu.be\/fwe-PjrX23o\nAn index fund is a big basket that holds a whole bunch of companies inside it. The main reason I like this investment so much is because most investors are REALLY bad at picking individual stocks\u2026and an index fund removes that variable from the equation, and because of that, you end up making more money.\n\nFourth: THE STOCK MARKET \nI generally recommend you do this within a Roth IRA to avoid getting taxed on your profit, but that isn\u2019t required. You could just as easily open an account on Webull using the link in the description and get 2 free stocks, and then trade totally commission free and reap some pretty good returns ;) \n\nFifth: REAL ESTATE - https:\/\/youtu.be\/YrOcHJYYl-0\nYou can cut down your housing costs ENTIRELY, INVEST in real estate, and save WAY more money at the exact same time\u2026and that\u2019s by doing what I call \u201cHouse Hacking.\u201d This is where you buy a multi-family home, like a duplex, triplex, or fourplex, then live in one of the units and rent the others out. You could also buy a single family home with a detached guest house, or even buy a house in then rent out the bedrooms. But typically, when done right, those other units will cover the entire cost of owning the building - and all of a sudden, you\u2019ve got a free place to stay. \n\nSixth: SIDE BUSINESS\nA side business in your 20s has the potential to grow completely independently from your main job - and NOW is the time for you to pursue that while you still have the energy to work long hours without feeling burnt out. \n\nSeventh: A GOOD CPA\nIt\u2019s SO IMPORTANT, as soon as possible, you hire a GOOD accountant who knows what they\u2019re doing, and can best structure your business so that you take advantage of everything that\u2019s available to you.\n\nEighth: PAY DOWN DEBT - https:\/\/youtu.be\/S9x1FoosIDo\nWhen you have high interest rate debt\u2026paying DOWN that debt is like getting a guaranteed return on your money at whatever interest rate you\u2019re paying down - if it\u2019s above 5%, it\u2019s usually best to pay that off early. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

One proposal that was just brought up is to tie the unemployment benefit to a states unemployment rate\u2026so, the $600 per week would continue \u201cuntil the state\u2019s three-month average total unemployment level falls below 11%.\u201d \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/the-extra-600-americans-receive-in-unemployment-benefits-ends-this-month-heres-what-else-is-on-the-table-2020-07-02\n\nSecond, we have another proposal known as the $4000 Explore America Tax Credit. \nHere\u2019s how this works: This would allow 50% of your travel related expenses to be deducted from your taxes, up to a maximum of $4000\u2026or, in other words, you can spend up to $8000 in travel and get HALF of that credited back to you. This would apply to things like airfare, hotels, lodging, recreation, restaurants, smashing the like button, and so on\u2026\n\nThird, we have THE NEXT STIMULUS CHECK. \nAs it is right now, it\u2019s looking like a very real possibility that ANOTHER stimulus check will be in the works - but it\u2019s unclear exactly how, and for what amount. The HEROS Act proposed a second round of stimulus checks going out to everyone who received them previously, meaning you could get another $1200 check if you made under $75,000 last year, or $2400 if you\u2019re married and made under $150,000 last year, with that stimulus check decreasing by $5 for every $100 you make above that threshold. \n\nFourth, we have a back to work bonus. \nSenator Rob Portman proposed that workers should receive a $450 per week BONUS to return back to work, that they\u2019re free to keep in addition to the money they earn from their job. According to him, $450 is an amount that would leave better better off financially than staying on unemployment and it would put more cash in people\u2019s pockets, it would make employers more likely to see their employees return, and it\u2019s slightly cheaper than giving out $600 per week as it stands now. \n\nFifth: Payroll Tax Cut\nAnytime you pay your taxes, you pay a small portion of that into Medicare and Social Security\u2026typically, it\u2019s about 7.65% or so. Any REDUCTION in the tax would just end up as you getting more money left over in your paycheck\u2026and if they cut it out ENTIRELY, it would be like you getting a 7.65% raise on top of what you were already making. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/05\/trump-wants-to-give-workers-a-payroll-tax-cut-how-it-would-work.html\n\nSixth: Infrastructure Spending\nThe goal is that the government spends money creating new highways, roads, bridges, rail systems, you name it\u2026and that, in turns, provides jobs and helps our economy. It was said that \u201cyou spend a dollar and you get back more than dollar in terms of revenue from the economic benefit.\u201d \nhttps:\/\/nypost.com\/2020\/06\/16\/trump-administration-prepares-1-trillion-infrastructure-package\/\n\nAs far as a timeline as to when this can all happen.. here\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. \n\nRight now, the senate is on what\u2019s known as a \u201cRecess,\u201d from July 3rd to July 17th, where they\u2019re not going to be in Washington DC actively negotiating these plans. \nhttps:\/\/www.senate.gov\/legislative\/2020_schedule.htm\n\nFrom there, it\u2019ll perhaps be a quick turnaround to get SOMETHING approved by the end of July - and that would mean things can begin progressing forward shortly after that. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

It\u2019s as easy as that. In addition to that\u2026.they\u2019re also offering a 0% interest on charges made within the first 18 months\u2026so, if there\u2019s anything you need free financing for, or if this is a way for you to otherwise avoid paying a ton of interest - this one works great. All with a NO ANNUAL FEE. \n\nBest for Travel: Chase Sapphire Reserve\nYou\u2019ll get 50,000 points when you spend $4000 on the card within the first 3 months - and those 50,000 points have a VALUE of about $750 when you redeem that for travel or straight up cash back. You\u2019re also going to be getting a $300 travel credit that applies to nearly anything travel related, like hotels, parking meters, airbnb, uber, airfare, timeshares, you name it - to me, this is pretty much just like free money because we\u2019ll all spend about $300 on this per year on stuff, anyway. You\u2019ll also get a $120 Statement Credit For Doordash Deliveries, and free DashPass for 2 years - which is worth another $120 per year. You\u2019ll also get 1 year of complimentary Lyft Pink when you activate the service using your card - and that\u2019s a $240 value. AND a whole bunch of other perks and services that are too much to mention. \n\nBest for Dining: American Express Gold Card\nWhen you sign up for this card - you\u2019ll get a sign-up bonus worth anywhere from 35,000 to 50,000 points when you spend $4000 within the first 3 months. They\u2019re also going to give you a $120 dining credit each year, which works out to a $10 per month statement credit when you pay at Grubhub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, Boxed, and participating Shake Shack locations. You\u2019re also going to be getting 4x points back on Restaurants and Supermarkets which - again, depending on how you redeem those points - that could essentially work out to be the equivalent of 8% cash back off your purchase\u2026and that makes this one REALLY good for all that grocery and restaurant spending. \n\nBest Sign Up Bonus: Chase Sapphire Preferred\nThis one wins the \u201cBEST SIGN UP BONUS\u201d category because you\u2019ll get 60,000 points when you spend $4000 within the first 3 months\u2026and those points are worth $750 worth of travel or cash back. Like I mentioned, Chase has that new system available for you to \u201cpay yourself back\u201d on your credit card bill, and with this card, each point is worth 1.25 cents back. \n\nBest for 0% Interest: The Capital One Quicksilver Card. \nI like this because they charge no annual fee, they give you 0% interest for 15 months on BOTH balance transfers AND purchases, they\u2019ll give you 1.5% cash back\u2026AND\u2026they will give you a $150 cash bonus when you spend $500 within the first 3 months. \n\nBest Overall Credit Card for 2020: Chase Freedom Unlimited\nTo start, there\u2019s no annual fee. You\u2019ll get 1.5% unlimited cash back on every purchase and 5x points on LYFT\u2026which is AWESOME. You\u2019ll also get $200 cash back when you spend $500 within the first 3 months\u2026which is even BETTER than the Capital One Quicksilver Card\u2026and you\u2019ll get 0% interest for the first 15 months on all of your purchases\u2026 all with no annual fee\u2026.what\u2019s not to like?\n\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Sure, we\u2019re printing more money than we know what to do with - but, that should hopefully keep prices high, all things considered.\n\nFor ANYONE who wants to be a successful investor LONG TERM, it\u2019s important to understand JUST how BAD market timing is, and how much this would cost you if you were WRONG IN 2020: \nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-07-03\/the-cost-of-bad-market-timing-decisions-in-2020-was-annihilation?srnd=markets-vp\n\nDespite the markets OVERALL being flat for this year\u2026if you missed out on just the TOP 5 trading days throughout the entire year\u2026you would be DOWN 30 PERCENT. \n\nEvidently, this is SO COMMON  that Citiground found that more than 2\/3rds of investors were MORE LIKELY to see a 20% LOSS from their investment than a 20% GAIN\u2026that\u2019s because, typically the mentality of most investors is: Prices are down, I better sell - and then when they drop EVEN FURTHER, I\u2019ll buy back in. \n\nBut, this type of game is more like a casino than an investment strategy\u2026because typically, some of the BEST days in the stock market happen after the WORST Days\u2026and if you aren\u2019t in the markets during the worst of times, you won\u2019t be in it for the best. \n\nAccording to JP Morgan, over the last 20 years - if you just kept your money invested, you would average a 5.62% return. If you miss JUST the best 10 trading days\u2026over 20 years\u2026your return drops to 2.01%. If you miss the top 20 best days\u2026now you\u2019ve LOST money from a 20 year investment\u2026so, literally over 20 years, just missing the best 20 days mean you LOSE MONEY. And from there, it gets even worse. \nhttps:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2019\/04\/11\/what-happens-when-you-miss-the-best-days-in-the-st.aspx\n\nThe moral of the story is just this: when you invest, as long as you\u2019re diversified and holding within a good company - the best thing you could do is just DO NOTHING. Keep holding. Stay invested. If the market drops, there\u2019s your chance to buy more - but don\u2019t change your investing strategy around someone who says the market is going to drop 40% like 1929, and keeps repeating that every year until maybe one day he\u2019s right. \n\nIn addition to that, though\u2026we also have another topic that everyone wants me to talk about, and I haven\u2019t really addressed it until now\u2026and that would be GOLD. What brings this to our attention is that Gold is now trading above $1800 an ounce, which is the highest level it\u2019s been since 2011\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.macrotrends.net\/2608\/gold-price-vs-stock-market-100-year-chart\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m just not a huge fan of investing in gold. I think it definitely CAN have a place in your portfolio, but it\u2019s certainly not an investment - just like I wouldn\u2019t call a savings account \u201can investment.\u201d I think it can work, in certain situations, but buying gold isn\u2019t the \u201cend goal\u201d - it doesn\u2019t produce anything, it doesn\u2019t provide a dividend, and transaction costs are so high\u2026I just don\u2019t recommend keeping much money in Gold, and I keep pretty much nothing in precious metals besides some old coins and a watch. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This leaves time for individual investors and speculators to buy in, anticipating it being added to the index within the coming week - and trying to make a profit. \n\nWhen it was researched, it was found that stocks DO generally see a rise in price once it\u2019s ANNOUNCED they\u2019re going to be added to an index - but ONCE they\u2019re actually added to the index, the pent up demand slows down - the stock price drops - and then it returns it a new \u201cnormal.\u201d \nhttps:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4009991-index-front-running-happens-stock-added-index\n\nThis was also confirmed by a study published in the 1990\u2019s, that found that the announcement and inclusion of a stock within the SP500 DID have a measurable effect on the price\u2026short term. \nhttp:\/\/people.stern.nyu.edu\/alynch\/pdfs\/jb97lm.pdf\n\nLong term, however, it was found that adding a stock to an index has no permanent effect on the price. \nhttps:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/medialibrary\/media\/research\/staff_reports\/sr484.pdf\n\nIn fact, it was studied that a stocks \u201cpremium\u201d for being added to an index completely wore off after 2 months, usually returning to the same price before it was ever announced. \nhttps:\/\/www.wealthdaily.com\/articles\/the-indexing-effect\/90018\n\nAnd overall, studies have shown that stocks added to an index did NOT see any superior performance and demand over stocks which were NOT traded within an index\u2026\nhttps:\/\/repository.upenn.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=joseph_wharton_scholars\n\nLikewise, it was also found that stocks REMOVED or BUMPED DOWN from an index did not see any large dip in price, now that they weren\u2019t being bought by an index\u2026.\nhttps:\/\/www.nber.org\/digest\/nov13\/w19290.html\n\nSo, IF Tesla gets added to the SP500 - according to all the history and research out there - the ANNOUNCEMENT that it\u2019ll be added will have a MUCH more powerful affect on the stock price than the actual INCLUSION of the stock to the index. After all, Yahoo was cited as being the most recent comparable of its size back in 1999\u2026that stock surged 64% in 5 days between the announcement of being added to the index, and actually being added to the index. \nhttps:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/2020\/07\/11\/tesla-tsla-stock-sp500\/\n\nBut once a company is added to an index - it must actually PERFORM well, and much of its stock price movement will be from it\u2019s earnings, performance, and ongoing development. Otherwise, if it doesn\u2019t perform well, it\u2019ll get bumped and the price will go down - causing a small percentage of the overall index to go down, with it. \n\nBut there\u2019s one message I just want to make clear\u2026in my personal opinion\u2026at these levels, investing in Tesla is a gamble - and if you\u2019re going to buy in, hold it with the expectation of keeping it for at a LONG TIME. This is the type of stock that\u2019ll be just as likely of dropping 50% as it is of going UP another 50%\u2026.so, if you buy in, just be prepared for a really, really wild ride - for better or worse.  \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Obviously, this is only going to be a rough ballpark and some people may be way ahead of this or way behind this - but, that\u2019s not important - it\u2019s more important to realize that NOW is the best time to begin working towards these goals. It\u2019s all about starting this as soon as you can, even if you\u2019re behind, and then working within your means to understand what you need to do to reach your future goals. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

I think people really respect that, and even though it\u2019s slower in the short term - it\u2019s going to be MUCH better in the long term. And also, it\u2019s REALLY important to like what you do \u2026 there\u2019s NO WAY I would\u2019ve been able to keep up such an intense schedule if I didn\u2019t thoroughly enjoy it, but the fact is - me working those crazy hours is so much fun, it would be like someone going on vacation for a few weeks and wondering how the time flew by so fast\u2026that\u2019s how I\u2019ve felt. And when that happens, that\u2019s when you\u2019re able to do your best work. \n\nAlso, practically in terms of making more money - doing something where you can leverage your time is ESSENTIAL. For example, it takes me the same amount of time to make a video for 1 person as it does 1 million people\u2026and that allows me to reach MORE people with the SAME amount of work. Same with working as a real estate agent - looking back, a better use of my time would\u2019ve been to hire someone to work under me rather than doing it all myself\u2026but, some of those lessons you only learn over time. \n\nThat\u2019s something that never really \u201cclicked\u201d with me before doing this, and that\u2019s how I was able to start seeing my income increase to some really mind-blowing numbers today. \n\n\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

If you know the answers to those 3, it\u2019s going to tell you EVERYTHING you need to know to be able to retire by 30. \n\nTo start, how much money you SPEND is going to be the most important variable of this entire calculation. \nGenerally speaking, if you\u2019re under 30 years old and you want your your money to last you INDEFINITELY without ever running out - you\u2019ll need to only spend 3% of what you have invested, each year. \n\nNow, how much you spend is going to GREATLY influence how much you\u2019ll need to retire\u2026because, for every $100 per month the spend, you\u2019ll need $40,000 invested in order for that $100 per month to last you forever. \n\nNEXT - HOW MUCH MONEY DO HAVE SAVED UP AND INVESTED?\nWhatever that amount is\u2026divide that by 33, and that\u2019s how much income your investments will be able to replace. From there, you\u2019ll need to do the super easy math to figure out how much more you\u2019ll need in order to retire\u2026all you need to do is take how much money you spend every year, multiply it by 33\u2026and however much that is, is how much money you\u2019ll need before you can call yourself \u201cRetired.\u201d \n\nThis is based on what\u2019s known as the Trinity Study, which analyzed the investment portfolios of stocks and bonds throughout every year in history, and calculated how much you could spend from your investment throughout a 30 year retirement - and that study found that you can spend 4% of your portfolio every year, and still have that money last you 30 years. \n\nHowever, a 30 year retirement isn\u2019t going to be long enough if you plan to start that retirement at 30 years old...so, in order to preserve more capital so you can retire for a longer period of time\u2026a 3% withdrawal rate was recommended. \nhttps:\/\/thepoorswiss.com\/updated-trinity-study\/\nhttps:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/how-much-can-you-withdraw-from-your-retirement-portfolio-453997\n\nAnd finally - the last factor in the equation - how much money do you currently make?\nThis is going to determine how long it\u2019s going to take you to hit your target retirement number, and whether or not you\u2019ll have to earn more money to get there sooner. \n\nHOW TO GET THERE: SAVING MONEY.\nThe Blogger MrMoneyMustache did the calculation for us, and found out how many years you\u2019ll need to work in order to retire compared to how much money you save. Using the 4% rule, he determined that - if you save and invest 70-90% of your income, you would be able to effectively retire within 10 years of working. \n\nPractically, if you want to do this by 30 years old - you\u2019ll either have to MAKE A LOT OF MONEY, or you\u2019ll need to SPEND VERY LITTLE MONEY - but, assuming you guys just want to make a whole bunch of money as fast as possible to be able to retire, I\u2019ll give you the honest run down on MAKING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE:\n\nYour BEST SHOT at being able to retire by 30, and make a LOT of money, is to work a job that pays you based on YOUR RESULTS, not how much TIME you put in. And at the end of the day - if you want to make a LOT of money just to be able to retire quickly - de-couple the idea that the more time you work, the more money you make - because that\u2019s very much NOT true, at all. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

I\u2019d venture to say that most states will have protections and resources in place for tenants NOT to all be evicted at once, AND - I\u2019d bet most landlords would want to work with any tenant who\u2019s willing to structure a re-payment plan. If that option becomes available, TECHNICALLY\u2026tenants would have even more time to catch up on missed payments before being evicted, so even if they know they can\u2019t pay in the future\u2026it\u2019ll buy them time. \n\nTwo, the other issue is the unemployment benefit of $600 per week potentially ending. \nTHE BRIGHT SIDE is that it looks UNLIKELY that the unemployment benefit is going to be COMPLETELY going away down to $0. This is probably going to need to be something that\u2019s slowly weened off and reduced over time as the economy begins re-opening, and perhaps within 6-12 months, the whole thing will go away\u2026but, for now, I do think it\u2019s important to continue to some degree, and that looks to be the case. \n\nThird\u2026we also have the FORECLOSURE CRISIS\u2026meaning, home owners are behind on their payments, they\u2019re in temporary forbearance, and once that pause period is up - lenders can foreclose and take back the home. \nYes, this IS something of concern - but, the numbers behind it aren\u2019t quite as alarming. Federally backed mortgages have given home owners the option to temporarily pause their housing payment for up to 180 days, with the option to EXTEND AN ADDITIONAL 180 days if needed\u2026so, a year SHOULD be sufficient time for home owners to restructure their loans and make up for missed payments at a later date, if need be. And, according to the research\u2026the number of loans in forbearance has actually been DECREASING recently, down to 7.8% according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nhttps:\/\/dsnews.com\/daily-dose\/07-21-2020\/loans-in-forbearance-hits-two-month-low\n\nALL OF THAT, COMBINED\u2026is what\u2019s going to lead us into a perfect storm, WORSE than 2008\u2026according to CNBC\u2026and, I have to say, as a total investing amateur who just makes video like this in a bedroom of my house and asks way too much for likes\u2026I would say the biggest elephant in the room, isn\u2019t necessarily what we just mentioned here\u2026.but, instead, how long our economy takes to re-open, how many jobs comes back, and how freely people begin spending money again. \n\nSo, overall - we have quite a lot going on right now, but headlines saying \u201cthis is a perfect storm\u201d is a little exaggerated\u2026yes, there are some serious concerns out there, that hinges on unemployment being extended\u2026BUT, the likelihood of this actually all happening at once is very slim, and I think we\u2019ll know by the end of this week whether or not the next stimulus package address these issues. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The current outline would provide the SAME payments as previously, so everyone who got a stimulus check LAST TIME would most likely just get another stimulus check.  \n\nIn order to be eligible for the full amount, you\u2019ll need to earn $75,000 or less as a single filer, or less than $150,000 as a married couple - and every $100 you make over that amount reduces your payout by $5. You\u2019ll also receive an extra $500 per dependent. \n\nNext, we\u2019ll need to talk about - arguably - the most important and pressing matter of the stimulus package, and that would be the extension of the unemployment benefits. \n\nAccording to the NEW HEALS plan, the unemployment benefits will be CONTINUED, but they\u2019ll be reduced from $600 per down down to $200 per week through September. After that, states will replace the unemployment maximum at 70% of a workers previous pay - meaning, anyone claiming unemployment benefits won\u2019t be making more money than they\u2019ve made from their job, and they\u2019ll now be making almost a third less until they get back to work. \n\nThis stimulus package is also going to closely examine the Paycheck Protection Program, and continue it further - BUT, it\u2019s going to limit who can apply by only opening this to companies with 300 or fewer employees who have seen a quarterly revenue loss of more than 50% - which, makes some sense - they want to make sure this goes to the businesses that need it the most, and that\u2019s a decent way of doing it. \n\nBesides that, the HEALS act also aims to shield businesses, doctors, and schools from lawsuits - The bill will also provide $105 billion towards helping schools reopen, and $30 billion of that would be allocated towards Colleges. It also includes another $16 billion to increase testing, and another $26 billion towards new developments and treatments. \n\nIt also allows for 100% deductibility of business meals\u2026whereas, right now that deduction is worth 50%. Finally, the bill also includes some additional tax credits and deductions for upgrades to the workplace that allow for operates to run safely. This might include spacing out desks, putting up more protection between people, and so on. And there\u2019s also employee retention credits for employers to keep staff on payroll. \n\nBut, as for the timeline on this - it\u2019s a little unclear, exactly. We know that they\u2019re PUSHING for a finalized bill to be put into effect by August 7th, because after that - they\u2019re going on recess until September 7th. But assuming it gets passed before then, we\u2019ll likely see new stimulus checks being dispersed in late August. \n\nEverything else between now and then is all negotiation. The next step is that this is going to be re-negotiated and slightly modified, although what we see now is going to be the BASE from which more things are added on to this\u2026it was even implied that it might be an option just to pass this now, and then see what else is needed in the future. \n\nThere\u2019s going to be a LOT of new developments this week, but the GOOD news is that a new stimulus package looks pretty much guaranteed to happen, it\u2019s almost confirmed that there will be a second round of stimulus checks the same as the last time, and that unemployment benefits WILL be extended - although it\u2019s going to be a reduced rate. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

You can make passive income two ways - the first is through the stock price going up over time, and the second is through their DIVIDENDS. \n\nSecond, we\u2019ve got another method for earning a LITTLE more passive income if you want to take a little more risk - and would be through buying individual dividend stocks. \nBUT\u2026as with anything\u2026with reward comes risk\u2026so, the more money you have the potential of making\u2026the more you have the potential of LOSING\u2026.and even though a stock might have a high dividend, it doesn\u2019t guarantee the price of the stock won\u2019t end up going down if the company doesn\u2019t perform well. So, keep that in mind and invest safely in companies with strong fundamentals - all of this is meant to be a long term investment. \n\nTHIRD\u2026.another way you can invest $500 for passive income is by buying a REIT.\nThink of this one like, instead of buying a stock in a company like I just mentioned earlier\u2026you\u2019re buying a stock in a real estate portfolio. Real estate investment trusts basically pool money from investors, buy up properties within a certain category, and then pay out a portion of their rental profit as a dividend.\n\nThe FOURTH way you can make passive income by investing $500 is by paying off high interest rate debt. \nConsider this like you\u2019re #1 investing decision if you have any interest rate above 5% or so that isn\u2019t a tax write off\u2026.PAY IT DOWN WITH $500. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026If you also have TIME on your hands and you want to take a very ACTIVE role in making WAYYYYYY more money with $500 - there are a few other options:\n\nThe first way you can invest your $500 is to go after sign up bonuses. \nBoth credit cards and banks will give you a \u201cbonus\u201d for opening an account with them and meeting some minimum requirements\u2026usually, that bonus is anywhere from $50 to $200, and it usually takes about 30 minutes of work to complete. \n\nThe next way to make passive income by investing your TIME alongside with $500 is\u2026oh man\u2026you know I\u2019m going to say it\u2026. making a YouTube channel. \nI still maintain that this CAN be a great way to make money IF you have a passion for talking to yourself\u2026alone in a room\u2026in front of a camera\u2026and then getting frustrated when your editing software freezes and crashes\u2026but if you can handle that and stick with it, YouTube CAN be more rewarding than your wildest imagination. \n\nFrom there, you can sell a product or a service that doesn\u2019t involve any further time on your end\u2026for example, I created a program called The YouTube Creator Academy. \nEven though it took a LOT of work upfront and a LOT of trial and error to get something to the point where it was worthy of selling it\u2026NOW, it runs on its own, and will likely continue running on its own for the foreseeable future. \n\nYou could expand your passive income sources through blogs, websites, and so on through affiliate marketing. \nThis is the practice in which you are marketing someone else\u2019s product, and you get paid a commission every time you get a sale. \n\nThe last way you can make passive income with $500 is to use that towards creating an online business that you can eventually run on autopilot - or without a lot of time on your end.\nUsing this money towards something like THIS would be a fantastic use of your time\u2026and, the experience you get from a $500 will help you in so many other areas of your life beyond just this.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

But even though record low rates means there has NEVER been a better time to buy real estate and get a mortgage, fewer sellers want to list their homes for sale, and that\u2019s creating a housing SHORTAGE. \n\nMarketwatch included a graph showing the trailing 12 month returns of real estate versus the stock market - and the great financial crisis of 2008 was the ONLY time where real estate experienced a 12-month trailing loss of more than 2%. That means, that - over the long term - real estate as an investment is going to be fairly stable and uneventful, despite what happens with our overall economy. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/look-what-happened-to-home-prices-when-the-coronavirus-sent-stocks-into-a-bear-market-2020-07-21\n\nReal estate is also proving to be a good hedge against inflation, and that could also be driving higher than normal demand with rates as low as they are. \n\nEven for myself, I\u2019m a firm believer in getting a low interest, fixed rate mortgages on cash flowing rental properties as a hedge against inflation - and then, just take 30 years to pay them off in full while the home goes up in value. I think that\u2019s a sound investment strategy when you do this correctly\u2026but the problem, at this point\u2026is that home prices are skyrocketing, and there\u2019s NOTHING to buy.\n\nAs a real estate investor, it\u2019s paramount that you get a good deal on a property with some upside so that you can fix it up and make repairs\u2026but, everything I\u2019m seeing is selling a premium because there aren\u2019t many other choices on the market, and prices are increasing faster than I expected because other people are willing to pay whatever it takes just to get the home. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with doing that if your intention is to buy something for yourself\u2026BUT, from an investment standpoint, it makes it VERY difficult to come out profitable. \n\nDespite all of that, though\u2026the future of what\u2019s going to happen with housing prices is hard to determine. Right now, yes - prices have been going up - a lot, whereas - seasonally, they would be going down. Sellers area also getting closer to their asking price, on average, than usual - but, how long can this hold up for? \nhttps:\/\/www.redfin.com\/blog\/home-sales-and-prices-keep-climbing\/\n\nWell, the tech company Haus predicts that real estate will see about a 1% decline into 2021\u2026but then predict, after that, growth could continue as high as 4-5% once our economy begins recovering. \nhttps:\/\/haus.com\/resources\/june-2020-hausing-market-forecast\n\nCoreLogic, one of the largest data analytics companies, found that - even though prices have risen 4.8% year over year\u2026they expect that, over the next year, will see a drop of 6.6% in real estate prices\u2026\nhttps:\/\/www.corelogic.com\/insights-download\/home-price-index.aspx\n\nI have a feeling, as long as consumer spending is low and our economy is shut down - interest rates will stay low, and demand for real estate will stay high. But, if that changes, after about 6-12 months or so, I would expect rates to slowly go back up - and that might begin to change the pace of real estate, especially if more sellers begin to list their homes for sale. \n\nI\u2019m still actively looking to buy something else for myself\u2026BUT, I want to make sure whatever I buy is somewhat of a good deal, and I\u2019m not going to overpay just for the sake of buying something. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

It\u2019s MORE important to own assets that MAKE you money, rather than just trying to get money as the end goal. \n\n-Wealth is constantly changing and evolving, money is always going to be flowing from one person to another\u2026and that\u2019s the beauty in it. You CAN make money without doing so at another person\u2019s expense - and the sooner you understand that, the sooner you can begin accumulating wealth. \n\n-The issue we ALL faced is that there are only 24 hours in a day\u2026so, beyond a certain point, it becomes iMPOSSIBLE to get ahead by working longer hours. BUT, WHEN YOU INVEST WHAT YOU EARN - your money can begin working independently from your time, and OWNERSHIP in assets like stocks, real estate, and a business is what will build wealth long term - not working more hours. \n\n-the internet has really leveled the playing field in terms of who can make money, and from where. It\u2019s no longer dependent that you live in a certain location to build a business, you no longer need a ton of money to open up a physical store, and as long as you can provide a service to someone else - and you find a way to show people the value of what you create - you can make money. \n\n-Each day you have the choice to build off the success of the previous day, OR, you can point that arrow down and that\u2019s the momentum you\u2019re going to carry forward. ANYTHING worthwhile is something you need to do consistently, without fail, as often as you can\u2026and when you get that down, that will bring you results.\n\n-They say you are the combination of the 5 people you spend the most time with\u2026so, surround yourself with people who inspire and push you to become a better person. If you surround yourself with negative losers, that\u2019s going to subconsciously influence you - if you surround yourself with people who continually improve themselves, that\u2019s going to push you just as much. \n\n-if you can\u2019t effectively articulate the benefits of what you have to offer to another person, they will never bother using it - even if it\u2019s the most revolutionary product of our decade. You have to learn how to sell, and whether you like it or not, life is often one big giant sales game.\n\n-You are paid in direct proportion to the value you provide, and how easily you can be replaced\u2026the more you make yourself indispensable, the more job security you have, the more you can earn, and the more longevity you will have.\n\n-Hiring people requires that someone AGREES to work with you, and even though it\u2019s impressive to say \u201cyou have X people working for you\u201d - it\u2019s not always necessary. Instead, running a digital business can continue to work exponentially - without requiring the work of more people.\n\n- If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement. Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.There is no skill called \u201cbusiness.\u201d Avoid business magazines and business classes.\n\nOr, in other words\u2026give value, give entertainment, teach something you know, ADD something to society, learn how to build and sell that, leverage your efforts NOW\u2026and learn by the experience of going out and doing it.

This is, as you would expect\u2026the OPPOSITE of inflation. This is what happens when the price of everything around us GOES DOWN, and all of a sudden - the longer we wait to buy something, the cheaper it becomes because our money has more purchasing power. \n\nIn a DEFLATIONARY economy, the prices of goods and services are going DOWN\u2026so, every month, things become cheaper to buy, and if you just HOLD ON to your money\u2026you\u2019ll feel good knowing that it\u2019ll be worth MORE the longer you DON\u2019T SPEND IT. \n\nBUT what REALLY ends up happening is that people just STOP spending money, because they know that money is just going to go up in value, so they hold off from buying anything. That causes demand for those goods and services to drop, which further causes people to spend less money, which causes businesses to scale back because they aren\u2019t making as much money, which causes people to lose their jobs or take reduced salaries, and now because they don\u2019t have as much money to spend, they don\u2019t spend anything\u2026and that sends everyone into another, far deeper recession. \n\nInflation, on a small, controlled scale\u2026is a REALLY, REALLY GOOD THING. If people know their money is going to be worth just SLIGHTLY LESS in the future\u2026it\u2019s going to incentivize them to spend it, because if they wait too long - their money is going to be worth less. That\u2019s good for our economy, it\u2019s good for business, and it\u2019s good for wages because employers can generally afford to pay a little more as their revenue increases a little more over time. \n\nIn the SHORT TERM, deflation could very well happen because businesses are shut down, people are still stuck inside, and no matter how much money the FED introduces into the economy - there needs to be a viable way for people to spend it, otherwise if you print money and just hold on to it - it\u2019s almost as though it doesn\u2019t exist. OR\u2026if you have nowhere to spend it, and you just INVEST your money instead\u2026then the INVESTMENTS begin to rise in value. \n\nThat leads ME to believe that the BEST thing to do in the SHORT TERM is make sure you have enough saved up to cover 6-9 months worth of your expenses as an emergency fund, preferably held in a high interest savings account - and then, just continually invest consistently into REAL assets like stocks and real estate that should rise on par with inflation long term. That\u2019s it. Some people also say GOLD\u2026but I\u2019m still not a fan of precious metals LONG TERM, and since I\u2019m a long term investor - I like something I can hold on to for 20-30 years and not worry about it under-performing.\n\nBut remember, in the short term - anything is possible, and the stock market is just as likely to go down as is it to go up - I have no idea, I\u2019m not psychic, and timing the market like this is a terrible idea. BUT\u2026given the last 100 years of data available to us\u2026investing in the markets over a 20 year period has never ONCE produced a negative result, and that\u2019s likely the best choice of action if you believe we\u2019re going to see much quicker inflation once our economy begins re-opening. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

That pays you 0.1% interest. \n\nSECOND: American Express Savings\n1% Interest Rate - No Fees - No Minimums\nHowever, with American Express - even though you\u2019re getting a 1% interest rate, this account is JUST MEANT TO BE A SAVINGS ACCOUNT and that\u2019s it. Unfortunately, they do not offer a checking account - so, you\u2019re not getting any debit card, and you\u2019re not getting a checkbook\u2026it\u2019s only a linked account online that you can transfer money into, earn that 1% interest - and then whenever you actually need access to the money, you can transfer it out and to another bank of your choice. \n\nTHIRD: Ally Bank\n1% Interest - No Fees - No Minimums\nAlly Bank is a full on bank - and they have checking accounts. Those checking accounts also pay interest..If you keep less than $15,000 in the account, they\u2019ll pay you 0.1%, which is the same as the Capital One 360 account - EXCEPT, once your balance exceeds $15,000 - they\u2019ll raise your interest rate to .5%. \n\nAlly Bank is also a lender, so you can get a loan through them if you decide to do that. And they\u2019re also an investment platform with $0 stock trades. So, in a way - you can get everything money-related done in one spot, from your checking account, stock trading account, and loan account. \n\nFOURTH: Vio Bank\n1.04% Interest - No Fees - $100 Minimum to sign up \nHOWEVER\u2026the downside is that, like American Express - this is ONLY an online savings account, which means no debit card, no checks, and if you want to get your money in or out - you have to setup a bank to bank transfer which will likely take a few days to complete. \n\nFIFTH: Redneck Bank\n1.1% Interest on first $10,000 - No Fees - $500 Minimum to sign up \nThey also have - instead of a savings account - a money market account, that pays up to 0.85% on balances up to $50,000.\n\nSIXTH: Varo Bank\n1.21% Interest - No Fees - $500 Minimum to sign up \nThey\u2019ll also LET YOU potentially earn up to 2.8% interest, up to a $10,000 balance\u2026.if you meet the minimum criteria. To do that within their savings account, you must make at least 5 debit card purchases in a month - which, most people do super easily just by buying $5 amazon gift cards, FYI. You must also have at least $1,000 worth of direct deposits going into the account. And the account CANNOT EXCEED $10,000. So, OVERAL\u2026this is still a GREAT option, and the 1.21 to 2.8% interest rate makes a LOT of cents for anyone with less than $10,000 and doesn\u2019t mind jumping through a few small hoops to get the higher interest rate.\n\nLAST: T-Mobile 4% Savings Account\nFirst, the 4% interest rate is ONLY available to T-Mobile customers\u2026so, if you\u2019re not with T-Mobile, this rate won\u2019t apply to you. Second, the interest rate is ONLY available for the first $3000 in the account - after that, you\u2019ll earn 1% interest. Which is still REALLY, REALLY good\u2026but it\u2019s far from the 4%. Third, you\u2019ll also need $200 per month in direct deposits into the account to be eligible. \n\nIf you can meet all 3 requirements, then YES - 4% is an AMAZING rate to get, even if it\u2019s only up to the first $3000 - and for T-Mobile Customers, as long as you don\u2019t mind opening up an account - this is a good one to get. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This new executive order would DEFER those taxes from September 1st through December 31st of this year for workers earning $4000 or less bi-weekly, before taxes.HOWEVER\u2026 as of RIGHT NOW, the Payroll tax WILL NEED TO BE PAID BACK in 2021, so even though you\u2019re getting more money upfront\u2026unless anything changes, you\u2019ll have to pay it back. \n\nNew EVICTION PROTECTIONS for tenants:\nhttps:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners\/\n\nWhat this DOES is give power to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the director of the CDC, to consider whether any measures of halting eviction is REASONABLY necessary to prevent the further spread of the illness. \n\nExtended Unemployment Benefits:\nhttps:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019\/\n\nThis calls for a $400 per week Unemployment Benefit ending no later than December 6th, 2020 - under this, the federal government would supply $300 per week, and the state you reside in would provide the other $100 per week. In order to be eligible, according to this executive order, the recipient MUST be eligible for at least $100 per week of unemployment compensation. That means some people, in certain states, would be under that $100 per week threshold - and therefore, not eligible for the extra $400 per week. \n\nFinally - STUDENT LOANS. \nhttps:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov\/presidential-actions\/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic\/\n\nIt\u2019s been ordered that all student loans held by the Department of Education be deferred until the end of the year, interest free. Just remember this doesn\u2019t apply to privately held loans, so if that\u2019s you - this executive order won\u2019t affect you.\n\nTECHNICALLY - these executive orders CAN be challenged in court, and that would delay these benefits from going into affect. \n\nOn a smaller scale, there are also some issues with all of these that need to be brought up for anyone wanting a full scope on the realities of how this will play out:\n\nWith the payroll tax holiday, it is only deferment - so the money needs to be paid back. It\u2019s also the EMPLOYERS who are responsible for withholding this tax and making sure it\u2019s paid, so it might create a logistical tax NIGHTMARE if they\u2019re not able to collect this money BACK, or make sure it\u2019s paid by the 1st of the year. So most employers, out of caution, would chose NOT to give their employees their payroll tax knowing that - most likely - they\u2019ll just have to pay it back a few months later. \n\nSecond, the housing protection isn\u2019t really an eviction or foreclosure protection at all - it only gives the authority to someone else who has the power, at their discretion, to enact protections - IF NEEDED. \n\nThird, the unemployment benefit is likely the most substantial from all of this - BUT, it\u2019s estimated that - as it\u2019s written - there\u2019s only enough funding to last for about 5 weeks, given the $44 billion dollar limitation . \nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2020\/08\/09\/heres-what-is-actually-trumps-four-executive-orders\/\n\nAND\u2026if and once the senate passes a full stimulus relief package\u2026that will over ride these executive orders, so this may only be temporary until something more permanent goes into effect. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Something like this is REALLY, REALLY important to understand - because out of the top 500 publicly traded companies\u2026the 5 LARGEST ones make up more than 20% of it\u2019s ENTIRE VALUE\u2026those companies, in order, are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Google\u2026Then, the other 495 companies make up the remaining 75% of the value. \nhttps:\/\/www.slickcharts.com\/sp500\n\nWhen you look at the breakdown of the SP500 over the last 12 months\u2026you\u2019ll notice that MORE THAN HALF of these companies are DOWN year over year\u2026or, 298 out of 500 to be exact. So, when you see that almost 300 companies have LOST value\u2026but, the SP500 still continues rising higher\u2026it makes you realize that, all of a sudden, those smaller companies in the index don\u2019t matter as much because they don\u2019t hold as much value, relative to the larger stocks in the index\u2026and THOSE are the stocks that are doing really, REALLY well. \nhttps:\/\/www.finscreener.com\/screener\/top-gainers\/stocks\/sp500?&o=14\n\nWell\u2026as far as what this means, and what you can do with all this information\u2026the answer is\u2026you just keep buying. The best strategy for most of you watching is to invest in an index fund, like the SP500\u2026.that way, you\u2019re buying into 500 different businesses and you\u2019re MORE than diversified across dozens of different industries, even IF 20% of that is still led by 5 companies\u2026and THEN, almost don\u2019t pay attention to where it\u2019s trading, as long as you make a schedule and invest consistently long term. That\u2019s it. \n\nIt\u2019s more important to realize that stocks will almost ALWAYS, CONSISTENTLY, hit new all time highs over and over again as these companies continue to grow. EVEN if you invested RIGHT before the Great Recession in 2007 at SP500 1557\u2026sure, in hindsight, you lost money short term\u2026but that\u2019s assuming you only invested ONCE and never again. The reality is that, most likely, you would continue to buy in every month\u2026thereby buying in CHEAPER AND CHEAPER every time you buy more. You would be buying the market ALL THE WAY down to the very bottom, and riding it all the way back up as the market recovers. \n\nPlus, instead of being FEARFUL about drops in the future\u2026you should look forward to them, in a way. When there\u2019s such an intense correction, see it as though you\u2019re getting a discount on EVERYTHING. From my experience\u2026the best days to buy more are ALWAYS those days you feel like throwing in the towel because prices keep dropping. OR\u2026every time you think \u201coh, I\u2019ll wait because it\u2019ll drop even more\u201d - that\u2019s usually a good sign you should buy now.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

That works out to be just under $270,000 per year, ON AVERAGE, each and every year in profit. \n\nThat also works out to be an OVERALL return of 285% for my real estate investments between 2012 and 2020. Obviously, most of that money was invested between 2016 and 2019\u2026but, still, that\u2019s our average. \n\nIn terms of cashflow from this\u2026my NET return between rent and mortgage equity is about $9400 per month, so on that $756,000 originally invested\u2026that works out to be a 14.92% annual cash return on my money, NOT accounting for home appreciation. \n\nHOWEVER: \n\nOne, real estate is a leveraged investment - meaning, I can BORROW most of the money I need from the bank at a low interest rate, and that will increase my returns. This is something that\u2019s not as COMMON to do with the stock market, and you certainly don\u2019t get the tax benefits of depreciation and a locked in interest rate like you do with owning a house. \n\nTwo, real estate is a lot of work - this was not a PASSIVE investment, BY ANY MEANS, until it gets rented out - and even then, it still requires a little work from time to time. These were all deals I spent a considerable amount of time finding and fixing up - so, it\u2019s a little unfair to compare that with stock market investing which is nearly entirely passive if you just buy an index fund and hold it. \n\nThree, I\u2019m comparing this with an SP500 index fund\u2026which, lets be real, is a safe and stable investment long term without much upfront work. But, had I picked individual stocks and gotten lucky\u2026.I would have made MORE money during that same timeframe. \n\nSo, at the end of the day\u2026based on all of this, YES - picking individual stocks CAN make you more money, OR you could end up losing more money. But, real estate, CAN be a relatively safe and stable return compared to a broad index fund, IF you\u2019re willing to put in the work, and ONLY buy properties with potential for IMMEDIATE upside.\n\nReal estate investing can be absolutely phenomenal, and now that I\u2019ve added up my total returns\u2026it makes me want to continue buying just EVEN MORE REAL ESTATE\u2026and smash the like button! :)\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

After that, there was a 42% drop\u2026followed by another 1 months of a bull market going back up 30%\u2026although, if we remove the volatility and simply base things off of a 6 month rolling time period\u2026the shortest UNINTERRUPTED BULL MARKET we\u2019ve had was 2.5 years. \nhttps:\/\/www.cascadefs.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/Bull-and-Bear-Markets-9-28-18.pdf\n\nSo, just given this context...even though, on average, bull markets do LAST LONGER than bear markets\u2026history has shown us that volatile could absolutely exist, and seeing drops or gains of 20% in either direction isn\u2019t as uncommon as you would think along the way. \n\nAfter that - lets talk about APPLE and TESLA STOCK SPLIT. So, why, all of a sudden, are stock splits sending the price even higher?\n\nWell\u2026honestly, it\u2019s for a few reasons - but the easiest, most likely answer is that it\u2019s PURELY PSYCHOLOGICAL, and investors feel like the stocks have more potential of making money the cheaper they are. As for whether or not stock split companies have a history of continuing to rise in price\u2026the answer is, it\u2019s unclear. Generally, stocks only split when they\u2019ve seen a large increase in price, and they believe their stock will continue to grow in value\u2026but, also, NOW, a stock split seems to me like a reason for people to pile in, creating the self-fulfilling prophecy that it will go up because others will buy it.  \n\nFinally - de-listing of NON US Companies on the stock exchange. The US wants to put strict regulation on what companies we can invest in, because they\u2019re concerned that US Investors would be at risk of potential issues. When it comes to this, I\u2019m a believer that transparency and openness IS EXTREMELY important when it comes to investing in a company - and there SHOULD be third party, verifiable audits if they\u2019re a publicly traded company. But, right now - there isn\u2019t a way for us to do that on a wide scale, HERE. \n\nDepending on who you ask, this might be a move in the right direction for further transparency and it could weed out some of the bad apples - but, it also sets the precedent that everyone must comply with these regulations, otherwise you won\u2019t be listed on the US Stock Exchange. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

You take your AFTER TAX INCOME and divide that income up as follows:\n\n50% of your income should be spent on your NEEDS - or, in other words, things you absolutely HAVE TO HAVE.\n\n30% of your income should be spent on your WANTS - these are things that you don\u2019t NEED to have, but they\u2019re NICE to have:\n\n20% should be spent on savings, investing, debt repayment, and so on. \n\nHOWEVER - here are my thoughts: \n\nI personally believe the best budget and way to save money is using the 50 \/ 10 \/ 40 approach:\n\n20% SPENT ON HOUSING\nMost experts are quick to suggest that housing your housing payment shouldn\u2019t exceed 1\/3rd of your income. Although  I\u2019d MUCH rather suggest that you spend - AT MOST - 25% of your income on housing, and - if at all possible - aim to spend more like 20%, or as little as you possibly can. \n\n10% TRANSPORTATION\nThe conventional wisdom is that your TOTAL cost of transpiration shouldn\u2019t exceed 15% of your income, and the total PRICE you pay for a car shouldn\u2019t exceed 35% of your annual salary. INSTEAD, I much prefer the DAVE RAMSEY approach when it comes to how much money to spend on transportation: He recommends that your transportation cost NOT EXCEED 10% of your annual income, you should ONLY buy USED cars until you have a net worth over $1 million dollars, and I would go so far as to say the value of the car you buy should be LESS than 25% of your annual income. \n\n10% FOOD or $600\/MO - whatever is less\nThat\u2019s why I believe a 10% food budget is OKAY when that adds up to less than $500 per month\u2026but, once you start making more money, your food budget doesn\u2019t need to go up alongside your income. \n\n5% Health Insurance\nHealth insurance can easily be 5% of your income\u2026or, about $200-$500 per month for a single person depending on your age, location, and health insurance provider. It\u2019s hard to put a \u201cmaximum amount\u201d to spend here because you shouldn\u2019t be cheap with your health\u2026but, we\u2019ll just round this off to 5% to be on the safe side. \n\n3% Utilities - $500 or LESS\nGenerally, for most, you\u2019re looking at around $50 - $250 per month - again, depending on your location and how hot or cold you like to keep your house. Or if you do laundry during off peak electrical hours.\n\n10% FUN \/ ENTERTAINMENT OR WHATEVER\nI think it\u2019s ABSOLUTELY reasonable that 10% of your income can be spent, without thinking about it, on whatever fun purchases you want to make, as long as this is budgeted for. It IS important that you have some money left over just to splurge, and spending 10% is just enough to \u201cget it out of your system\u201d without getting carried away. \n\n42% SAVINGS \nThe first thing I would do is save up a 6 month safety  fund, in cash, held within a high interest savings account. \n\nBut once you\u2019ve done that, your remaining savings should go towards maxing your your 401K up to your employer contribution limit. \n\nAfter that, the next $6000 you invest should go towards maxing out your Roth IRA. \n\nFrom there, any money you have left over should go towards a TAXABLE INVESTMENT account or some other type of investment that will grow over time. \n\nAt a 42% savings rate\u2026you\u2019d EASILY be able to retire in just about 20 years from the 4% rule like I mentioned earlier\u2026meaning, if you start doing this NOW at 20 years old\u2026by the time you\u2019re 40\u2026you will be nearly ready to retire, if you want to. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Not to mention, practically\u2026no one expects you to live lavishly in your 20s, anyway. You can easily get away living with room mates, driving an old car, wearing sweatpants every day, and not eating out because MOST people do that in their 20\u2019s, anyway. So embrace it - and lean into that stereotype because you can only get away with that for so long before it starts being less socially acceptable. \n\nSecond - DON\u2019T IGNORE YOUR CREDIT SCORE - https:\/\/youtu.be\/Vn9ounAgG3w - FULL VIDEO ON CREDIT SCORE\nIf you don\u2019t have any credit whatsoever right now, just go and sign up for a discover it secured credit card with a $300 limit, put a few minor expenses on the card every few months, and pay it off in full. Seriously, building your credit is actually THAT easy. It\u2019ll take you MAYBE 2 minutes PER MONTH to do this, and as long as you slowly add more no-annual fee credit cards into the mix every 6-8 months and pay your bill in full and on time, you can EASILY get a PERFECT credit in 2-3 years for $0 out of pocket. \n\nThird - Don\u2019t want for things to happen\nHere\u2019s what you need to know: Nothing will happen if you don\u2019t take the initiative to MAKE IT HAPPEN. And this is a shame because NO ONE IS TAUGHT HOW TO GO AFTER THEIR OWN GOALS\u2026ON THEIR OWN\u2026WITHOUT BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO. If there\u2019s something you want - it\u2019s up to you to make it happen. If you have a goal, you\u2019ll need to actively work towards it. There\u2019s no deadline, there\u2019s no homework, there\u2019s no test\u2026it\u2019s just YOU, for better or for worse. You need to learn to hold yourself accountable for everything you do, and ONLY YOU will keep yourself on track. \n\nFourth - Don\u2019t play it too safe and take some risk\nbusiness, moving careers, because every new experience will come with knowledge you can use in the future. Not to mention, getting in the habit of putting yourself in uncomfortable situations NOW is going to make it SO MUCH EASIER to continue doing that in the future - and those are where your BEST opportunities usually are. \n\nFifth: No one has any idea what they\u2019re doing \nSo, just take comfort knowing that you\u2019re not alone if you\u2019re still figuring things out, or if you\u2019re disappointed you don\u2019t feel like you have it all figured out - that feeling probably won\u2019t go away, but once that you know everyone feels that way and it\u2019s NORMAL - it gets easier. \n\nSixth: Don\u2019t worry about things that haven\u2019t happened yet\nInstead - in your 20s - spend your time thinking about the MOST LIKELY SCENARIO, and think about how you work TOWARDS something - not how can you work AWAY from something. Mental energy is something that goes a LONG way - and if you\u2019re wasting your time stressing about things that don\u2019t matter, that\u2019s less time that you can focus on what DOES matter and what WILL actually get you ahead. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

By that logic, if I\u2019m able to invest $50,000\u2026that\u2019ll cover the basic grocery bill for pretty much the rest of my life. If I can get $350,000 invested in a rental property\u2026that\u2019s enough passive income to cover a 1 bedroom apartment in Los Angeles in a good area. And at $1 million invested\u2026that\u2019ll replace the average annual salary from most full time employees. I challenge you to start thinking the same way, as well\u2026this will make the aspects of saving and investing so much easier, and over time - you can replace all of your expenses by having your money do all the work for you. \n\nSecond, beyond the essentials\u2026I only try to buy things that I can put to work that will make more money, or can be seen as an investment. \n\nFor example, I consider the computer that I\u2019m editing on right now to be a good use of money, that helps expedite the work I do. Or, buying an extra camera to film on so I could get a second angle for The Graham Stephan Show\u2026or, paying extra to create a brick veneer for the background of my videos so they\u2019re more visually appealing\u2026or, even something like this house that I bought, I find it much more relaxing to work outside and come up with new content - and when I feel more at ease, I tend to produce better quality. If you can find a way to coordinate your expenses around things that will help INCREASE your productivity or income, it can be absolutely worth it. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

BECAUSE the Federal Reserve has been seeing LESS THAN 2% inflation\u2026and, in this year, we\u2019re basically seeing NO INFLATION \u2026the FED just said: We can let inflation go as HIGH AS IT NEEDS to\u2026as long as we just \u201cAVERAGE OUT TO 2% IN THE LONG RUN.\u201d\n\nThink of this like \u201cmaking up for lost times\u201d - or, encouraging short term inflation, with the expectation that they can bring it down in the future once our economy recovers.  In the PAST, if inflation were to exceed 2%\u2026EVEN IF PRIOR YEARS WERE WELL UNDER 2%\u2026the Fed would begin to raise interest rates, and put a stop to rising inflation\u2026but now, they\u2019re going to let it ride for the purposes of bringing up that average, and helping get our economy back to a new normal. \n\nHere\u2019s the GOOD news\u2026\n\nFOR INVESTORS: This COULD MEAN the value of your investments could be going up. \nThat\u2019s because, GENERALLY speaking, asset values like stocks and real estate RISE with inflation\u2026that\u2019s because, as more money is available within our economy, either from lower interest rates or more currency going into circulation, usually that money is spent and dispersed back into the economy, where it inadvertently boosts up stock and real estate prices as people spend and earn more. \n\nSecondly, for anyone holding onto loans, especially MORTGAGES - this is a GOOD THING. \nIf you have a 2%  mortgage on your property, but INFLATION is 3% per year - that means INFLATION is actually making your mortgage CHEAPER to pay off every year, by eroding away the amount you owe on it.\n\nThird, high inflation also makes our national debt EASIER to pay off to the point where - the longer you DON\u2019T pay it off - the cheaper it becomes. \n\nSo, overall\u2026the WINNERS here are the people who have investments, who take out well calculated, low interest fixed rate loans, and who just HOLD ON to their investments as long as possible. \n\nHOWEVER - Not everyone will be a winner, and there are some consequences to this\u2026\n\nThe first person who\u2019s going to lose from this is the person who isn\u2019t investing their money.\nIf you haven\u2019t been investing your money this year\u2026your money has ALREADY lost its purchasing power compared to where we were in January, in terms of stock and asset prices. \n\nSecond, people who are SAVING MONEY are also going to lose in this situation. \nBecause the federal reserve is encouraging more inflation, that means that your savings are going to be worth LESS each and every year that you don\u2019t either spend or invest it. Now, don\u2019t get the wrong idea - it\u2019s ALWAYS a good idea to hold some cash on the side in case of an emergency or for your normal expenses - BUT, you should always aim to keep that money within a high yield savings account, so it doesn\u2019t lose AS MUCH value.\n\nThat means, the BEST course of action RIGHT NOW is just this:\n\nOne: Don\u2019t keep TOO MUCH CASH on hand without having a short term purpose for that money. \n\nSecond, keep investing your money and then - JUST HOLD. \n\nThat means that you should ONLY invest money that you know you won\u2019t be touching for at least 10 or 20 years, because who knows what will happen in the short term. \n\nAnd third, it\u2019s also just as equally important to stay employed, continue to grow and expand your skills, and negotiate a competitive salary as often as you can to make sure you\u2019re fairly compensated for your work.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This type income is generally going to be your priority until\u2026everything else starts making more money\u2026\n\nThe SECOND source of income: DIVIDEND INCOME\nThis is probably the EASIEST \u201cSecond Income\u201d source for nearly ANYONE watching to start literally RIGHT NOW. Here\u2019s how that works: when you buy a stock, what you\u2019re REALLY buying into a small ownership share of that company. Now that you own a small piece of the company by investing in their stock - some of those companies will pay you out a \u201cdividend,\u201d which is a fancy word for saying: they\u2019re going to pay you a portion of their profits, because you own a small piece of their company by buying their stock. \n\nThe Third: CAPITAL GAINS. \nThis is what happens when you sell an investment for a profit - and when that happens, you\u2019re taxed on \u201cCAPITAL GAINS,\u201d which is the difference in price between what you bought it for, and how much it was worth at the time you sold. This is ALSO another way you can make money by investing in stocks - because, unlike our second source of income - not ALL stocks pay dividends. Instead, many stocks are known as what\u2019s called \u201cGrowth Stocks,\u201d in the sense that what they DON\u2019T pay as a dividend generally gets re-invested back into the company, thereby causing the stock price to go UP. \n\nThe Fourth: INTEREST INCOME. \nThis happens when you keep money in a high yield savings account, or basically ANY bank account that pays you even a remotely small amount of interest - chances are, at the end of the year, they issue you a 1099-INTEREST form with the amount of interest that you earn, so you can report that to the IRS. \n\nThe Fifth: RENTAL INCOME\nFor most people who want to invest and build wealth, real estate winds up having so many tax advantages that make it REALLY unique - and profitable - for anyone willing to put in the time, and within just ONE property, you could have MULTIPLE income sources. You also have the power to LEVERAGE your money here, where you borrow MOST of the money from the bank. You can also DEPRECIATE the value of the property against your rental income, thereby reducing your taxes. \n\nThe Sixth: PROFITS FROM A BUSINESS\nWorking on ANY type of side business, that has the potential to grow completely independent from your main job, is not only a good way to make more money - but also, diversify yourself iN CASE something happens to your job and you have nothing to fall back on. \n\nThe Seventh: Royalty Income\nWith this, you get paid a licensing fee for selling the rights to a product, service, song, or something that you\u2019ve created. You can absolutely work to create something ONCE, that you can then continually re-sell in the future as long as people will buy it. I know it\u2019s WAY easier said than done, but things like online programs, e-books, YouTube videos, or blogs can often be setup ONCE - and then - over time, you\u2019ll continue to make money for as long as it exists. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is rather subjective as to what\u2019s reasonable to pay given the circumstances, but they leave that to you to decide. \n\nThe big glaring problem with this, however\u2026is that - when this is over - rent is still due, at which point, we\u2019re right back to square one, and even though this is a fix RIGHT NOW - it\u2019s more like kicking the can a little further down the line, at which point - we\u2019ll still have to deal with the exact same problem, but in the future.\n\nFrom a numbers standpoint, a Harvard Study found that there are 43 million renters in the United States\u2026and the National Multifamily Housing Council found that, overall, most tenants ARE still paying their rent, even after the unemployment benefit ended. \n\nThey collect data from 11 MILLION apartments every month, and as we can see\u2026last year, about 96% to 97% of tenants have paid their rent in full by the end of the month. THIS YEAR, that\u2019s hovered about 95% to almost 96%. Even as recent as August 27th, 92.1% of tenants have paid their rent in full\u2026that\u2019s only slightly below the 94% that paid rent in full by the same time, last month. \nhttps:\/\/www.nmhc.org\/research-insight\/nmhc-rent-payment-tracker\/\n\nNow, keep in mind - this doesn\u2019t count partial payments or payment plans - but, overall, as we can see - missed rent hasn\u2019t dropped THAT much from the last year, BUT - the big change is that those non-paying tenants can no longer be evicted. That means, if we have 43 million renters - and 6% of them are not paying in full - that\u2019s about 2.5 million renters who are behind on their payments and protected by non eviction, and that\u2019s about 400,000 MORE than we had at this same time, LAST YEAR, pre-illness. \n\nThe GOOD news\u2026or the silver lining here\u2026is that we\u2019re unlikely to see a \u201cWave of foreclosures,\u201d because the vast majority of home owners have plenty of equity in their home if they decided to sell. This study found that, overall, only 6.2% of loans were under water.\nhttps:\/\/www.nationalmortgagenews.com\/news\/mortgage-equity-report-in-second-quarter-2020-finds-fewer-are-underwater\n\nIf we calculate this into real numbers, there are 128 million households in the United States\u2026and 60% of those have a mortgage.

An article just published by CNN explains how SoftBank could be the NASDAQ \u201cwhale\u201d that has the power to manipulate the entire market - and here\u2019s how that works. \n\nSoftBank invested $4 BILLION DOLLARS into certain tech companies through what\u2019s known as a call option - this means SoftBank pays a \u201cSmall Fee\u201d for the RIGHT to buy a certain stock, at a certain price, by a certain date. When SoftBank invests $4 BILLION DOLLARS into the market place buying up specific stocks all at once\u2026they have the power to POTENTIALLY MOVE THE ENTIRE MARKET alongside with it, because SOMEONE ELSE needs to buy those 100 stocks to make the transaction. That now gives the theory that - possibly - traders like this have the power to influence and move the market, either up like we\u2019ve seen recently - or down, when they begin to sell. \n\nAs far as what you can do about it - HONESTLY, I don\u2019t see this as a big deal. Drops like this are NORMAL, they\u2019re not causes to panic, and as long as you have a plan to hold your investment LONG TERM - just see these little dips as \u201cflash sales,\u201d buy more - and hold on long term. In the big picture, it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBUT, if you\u2019re investing in risky stocks with no knowledge of what you\u2019re investing in, and you\u2019re only buying in because you don\u2019t want to miss out on the hype money train\u2026then yeah, you\u2019re better off selling, and holding out until you have a better grasp of your investments, and this should NOT be a market to gamble money you can\u2019t afford to lose. ONLY invest in stable funds or stocks you REALLY know the fundamentals of, long term - and that\u2019s it, for 99% of you watching. Buy and hold, as they say\u2026\n\nFinally\u2026lets talk BRIEFLY about Tesla NOT getting into the SP500, and now it\u2019s subsequent 35% DROP in a matter of a few days. \n\nNow, here\u2019s the thing - in order to be eligible for SP500 inclusion, a company must hit a few key criteria points, one of which being that they\u2019ve had 4 quarters of profitability - which, TECHNICALLY, Tesla just hit. HOWEVER\u2026just because a stock meets all the criteria of getting into the SP500, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically going to be added in. \n\nThere is a committee of 9 members that meet every month to decide on who gets added - and who gets removed - from the index, and how they vote which stocks get added or removed isn\u2019t known and isn\u2019t published ahead of time. It\u2019s speculated that Tesla is just too volatile to be added to the index quite yet, and for a stock to swing + or - 35% in a few days, at a hundred billion dollar valuation, isn\u2019t quite something best suited for positioning within an index. \n\nIn terms of where we stand today - I\u2019m not too shocked that the markets have fallen so much over these last few days. The stock market has risen nearly every single day for almost 2 weeks straight\u2026there\u2019s no \u201cREAL REASON\u201d for that, and as illogical as the stock market is - just like we can\u2019t question why it\u2019s going up, we can\u2019t reason why it\u2019s going down - it just does what it wants, and it\u2019s up to us to enjoy the ride, have fun watching it - but, at the end of the day, the ONLY thing we can do is consistently buy and hold - that\u2019s it. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And maybe I\u2019m just new to this whole auto-pilot feature thing, but when you\u2019re surrounded by other cars - the autopilot isn\u2019t as \u201csmooth\u201d or \u201cintuitive\u201d as a normal driver would be. But, I trust this will improve over time. \n\nNAVIGATE ON AUTO PILOT - BETA\nNavigating highways IS really neat, but would I pay $8000 for it? Probably not. I think it\u2019s really useful in the grand scheme of things, once FULL autonomous driving becomes a thing - but, as it stands right now, it\u2019s fun to use, but I\u2019d rather save the money. \n\nAUTO PARK:\nThe Self Parking Feature was really cool and precise, but lets be real - a lot of cars are enabling this as a feature, so it\u2019s not UNIQUE to Tesla, per se\u2026it\u2019s also someone difficult to find that \u201cSweet Spot\u201d where Tesla recognizes that as a spot to park, so if you\u2019re in fast traffic and need to \u201cAdjust\u201d so that it\u2019s ready to self park - it might take too long to actually be very practical. \n\nSUMMON FEATURE:\nThis is awesome, and I can definitely see how someone could get a lot of use from this. Sometimes I just hate going and sliding myself in the side to get to my car, so using THIS would be a perfect way to bring the car out. It\u2019s also ideal if you\u2019re parked in a tight spot, or someone pulls in next to you without leaving a lot of room for you to get in and out\u2026this will FOR SURE come in handy. Is it worth $8000? Well, that just depends how nimble you are to climb into your car\u2026\n\nSMART SUMMON:\n Tesla says \u201cyour car will navigate more complex environments and parking spaces, maneuvering around objects as necessary to come find you in a parking lot.\u201d I\u2019m disappointed this wouldn\u2019t work on a larger distance. As it is right now, you have to be somewhat close to your car for this to even work\u2026and, at that point, you may as well just walk all the way to your car instead of standing there with your phone out, getting the car to come to you. Maybe at some point they\u2019ll expand the radius, and I get that this is all just a beta mode\u2026but, my only complaint is that I can\u2019t do this from a further distance. \n\nTRAFFIC AND STOP SIGN CONTROL - BETA\nThis identifies stop signs and traffic lights and automatically slows your car to a stop on approach, with your active supervision. This was the biggest disappointment from the entire experience\u2026I would expect, for $8000\u2026they would tell you upfront that you need a hardware upgrade for this to work, and would need a service appointment to get the features you pay for. It\u2019s not the end of the world, but I was looking forward to getting to try everything out at once and test the stop sign and stop light feature\u2026I\u2019ll make the appointment and get back to you, though. \n\nAs for whether or not this $8000 upgrade was \u201cworth it\u201d \u2026I\u2019ll be honest\u2026no, not as it is right now. I understand that $8000 is just the price to \u201cGet in now\u201d before full self driving is a thing, and by that time - this could very well be worth $15,000 or $20,000 for a car that just completely runs itself\u2026but the risk you\u2019re taking is, how long is THAT going to happen? Is it next year, 5 years from now, 20 years from now, and what\u2019s the opportunity cost of buying into a feature that isn\u2019t fully functional yet, versus investing that money?\n\nHOWEVER\u2026it IS worth it for people who plan to keep their car long term, and expect more autopilot features to become available before he again raises the price\u2026and, he will. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Those points can be used towards free travel, free hotels, or sometimes PROFIT back in your bank account\u2026therefore, if you know how to do this PROPERLY, you might NEVER have to pay for another vacation, hotel, or plane ticket - EVER AGAIN. Resources: NerdWallet - ThePointsGuy - AskSebby - TheCreditShifu \n\nSECOND: REVERSE IMAGE SEARCH EVERYTHING YOU BUY ONLINE\nMost online retailers get their products from the exactly same source, but some charge WAY more money than others just because they have a big name or a fancy website behind them. When you find something you want to click, just right click and \u201csearch google for this image.\u201d All of a sudden, every website containing that same image will pop up - and that will allow you to click through and find the same item listed for cheaper somewhere else. \n\nTHIRD: DON\u2019T BUY SOMETHING JUST BECAUSE IT\u2019S ON SALE. \nYou're not saving money just because it's discounted - at the end of the day, you're still spending. Most people wind up focusing MORE on how much they saved rather than how much they spent\u2026when, in reality, focusing on how much you SPEND is what matters the most. \n\nFOURTH: POSTPONE ALL PURCHASES BY 72 HOURS\nThis one is really just about cutting down on impulse purchases that you make without really thinking about it. If there\u2019s something you want, just wait 72 hours to buy it. After that, if you still want it, AND you\u2019ve found the cheapest place you can get it\u2026then go for it. \n\nFIFTH: ONLY DRINK WATER\nNot only is this cheaper for you - but it\u2019s also HEALTHIER for you. There have been SO MANY STUDIES conducted on the health risks of drinking sugary drinks and sodas and how they effect you. Just regular filtered tap water is good enough!\n\nSIXTH: ALWAYS MAKE YOUR OWN COFFEE: https:\/\/youtu.be\/tvL4FF2lMnw\nThe average American spends $1100 PER YEAR on coffee..and more than 45% of 18-23 year olds have spent MORE MONEY ON COFFEE than they have on their retirement, and 35% of 24-35 year olds have done the same. I always make coffee at home!\n\nSEVENTH: I ALWAYS BUY GENERIC BRAND ITEMS.\nA LOT of big brands source their product from the EXACT same places that supply the more expensive, name brand items. For example, Kirlkand Signature Coffee is roasted at the Starbucks Coffee Company. Kirland batteries are actually made by Duracell. \n\nEIGTH: NEGOTIATE CAR INSURANCE RATES\nI\u2019ve personally saved over $100 per month by shopping around car insurance rates, moving from AAA\u2026to Gieco\u2026to Mercury\u2026and now, I\u2019m with Tesla Auto Insurance. \n\nNINTH: EAT DURING HAPPY HOUR\nThe earlier or later it is, the less busy restaurants are\u2026and, most of them try to fill this empty space by offering a \u201chappy hour\u201d with discounted food. Now, this is a fantastic option for you to capitalize on this and save the money just by finding places with good happy hour menus, and showing up to eat a bit earlier. \n\nTENTH: THINK: WHAT'S THE FUTURE VALUE?\nFor example, instead of spending $100 on a pair of shoes TODAY\u2026that could be worth $1478 in 35 years if it\u2019s invested at an 8% return. Or, spending $300 per month leasing a car every year could ACTUALLY be worth $723,000 in future money if you just invested it during that same timeframe. When you begin putting things in THAT perspective, you begin to realize that every dollar you spend TODAY is really worth $14 in the future. \n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: Watch the video ;)\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Buying this ONE index fund is basically the equivalent of buying all 500 of the largest companies in the US, and you\u2019ll get access to some of the bigwigs like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, and so on. \n\n#4: VTSAX Vanguard Fund Total Stock Market\nCost: 0.04% Expense Ratio\nMinimum: $3000 Investment\nAlternative ETF: VTI\nWhat makes this so unique is that it encompasses the ENTIRE US stock market in ONE single fund\u2026like, this is EVERYTHING. If there\u2019s a small cap, medium cap, or large cap stock in any industry you can think of - this index fund has a tiny piece of it\u2026and for one low price, you can get exposure to 3,529 stocks\u2026\n\n#3: SWPPX Charles Schwab SP500 Fund Fund\nCost: 0.02% Expense Ratio\nMinimum: NONE\nThis index fund was started in 1997 and it ALSO follows the SP500. \n\n#3 (Tied): SWTSX Charles Schwab Fund\nCost: 0.02% Expense Ratio\nMinimum: NONE\nThis encompasses the entire US stock market index, similar to VTSAX. \n\n#2: FXIAX Fidelity Fund Total Stock Market Fund\nCost: 0%\nMinimum: NONE\nThis is Fidelity\u2019s version of the SP500 index fund with NO EXPENSE RATIO and NO MINIMUMS. \n\n#2 (Tied): FZILX Fidelity International Stock Market Fund\nCost: 0%\nMinimum: NONE\nThis is, in my opinion, a GOOD index fund for everyone to at least get in on - because an international index fund will cover foreign and emerging markets that COULD perform very well over the next few decades. Now, it is true that - Historically, the SP500 has been a better investment than international stocks - but that might not ALWAYS be the case, especially as other markets are REALLY ramping up production and consumption. It also gives you a little more diversification OUTSIDE the United States - just in case, you never know. \n\n#1: FZROX Fidelity Total Stock Market Fund\nCost: 0%\nMinimum: NONE\nUnlike Vanguard, which has a 0.04% expense ratio - this one has NO EXPENSE RATIO. It\u2019s TOTALLY FREE.\n\n#1 (Tied): FNILX Fidelity SP500 Index Fund\nApparently, they couldn\u2019t just say this is the SP500 because they\u2019d have to pay fees to license that name\u2026but hey, call it whatever you want if that means they can pass the savings on to the customer. With this, you\u2019ll get the same SP500 index fund with no minimums and no fees\u2026so, there you go, that\u2019s a win for this fund. \n\nSo between everything I just mentioned, you should be able to find the PERFECT index fund to invest in - index funds within Vanguard certainly have the name recognition behind them, but others like Charles Schwab and Fidelity are cutting fees in an effort to get you to buy theirs, instead. Either way, this is GOOD for you - because now, you get to save more money. \n\nSeriously, if all you did was just buy a total stock market index fund every month and nothing else - over 20 years, you would out perform the VAST majority of hedge fund managers, and you\u2019d put yourself in a GREAT financial position to make as much money as possible.

And, two\u2026it gets you 2% CASH BACK on ALL PURCHASES\u20261% when you make a purchase and 1% when you pay it off\u2026WITH NO LIMITATIONS. That\u2019s why this card is a MUST-HAVE for everyone to keep in their wallet.\n\nSECOND: AMAZON PRIME CARD\nThe Amazon Prime Card is for customers who have an eligible Amazon Prime Membership, and the card itself has absolutely NO ANNUAL FEE, so it\u2019s totally free to keep open as long as you possibly can. With this card, you\u2019re going to be getting 5% cash back on ALL Amazon and Whole Foods purchases, you\u2019ll get 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores\u2026and then 1% cash back on everything else. \n\nTHIRD: CHASE FREEDOM FLEX CARD\nThis one is TOTALLY FREE WITH NO ANNUAL FEE, and it's meant to replace the Chase Freedom. They\u2019re giving you the same 5% cash back on travel, the same 3% cash back on dining, the same 3% cash back at drug stores\u2026but NOW, instead of giving you 1.5% cash back on all purchases, which isn\u2019t THAT good because you could just use the Citi Double Cash for 2% back\u2026they\u2019re giving you 5% cash back on revolving categories, and then 1% back on everything else. \n\nThey\u2019ll also give you $200 back when you spend $500 on the card within the first 3 months, AND they\u2019ll give you 5% back on grocery store purchases (not including target or Walmart) on up to $12,000 in the first year. \n\nFOURTH: AMERICAN EXPRESS GOLD CARD\nThis card costs you $250 PER YEAR\u2026 BUT, on the bright side - for that price\u2026you\u2019re going to be getting some really decent perks and services: You\u2019re going to get 4x points spent on dining - like restaurants, take out, and delivery. You\u2019ll also get 4x points back on grocery stores, all the way up to $25,000 PER YEAR. then you\u2019ll get 3x points back on flights and 1x points back on everything else. You\u2019ll also get 35,000 points just for signing up and spending $4000 on your card within the first 3 months. \n\nNow, as far as how much each point is worth - It depends how you redeem it. The website MillionMileSecrets has a great breakdown on this and how to best redeem those points:\nhttps:\/\/millionmilesecrets.com\/guides\/amex-points-value\/\n\nThis Amex Gold will also be giving you a $120 dining credit, and they\u2019ll give you a $100 airline credit towards incidentals every year. Not to mention, AMEX has some of the best customer service in the world - and their purchase protection is absolutely top notch. \n\nNUMBER FIVE: THE CHASE SAPPHIRE RESERVE\nIt\u2019s going to cost you $550 per year as an annual fee\u2026so, right from the start, this is NOT for everyone - but, it might be worth it: One, the sign up bonus: You\u2019ll get 50,000 points when you spend $4000 on the card within the first 3 months - and those 50,000 points have a VALUE of about $750 when you redeem that for travel or straight up cash back. \n\nIn ADDITION to that, you\u2019re also going to be getting a $300 travel credit that applies to nearly anything travel related.  You\u2019ll also get a $120 Statement Credit For Doordash Deliveries, and free DashPass for 12 months. You\u2019ll also get 1 year of complimentary Lyft Pink when you activate the service using your card - and that\u2019s a $200 value. You\u2019ll get free priority pass lounge access for yourself and up to 2 guests anytime you travel .\n\nSixth, you\u2019ll also get complimentary global entry or TSA PreCheck which works out to a $100 statement credit every 4 years. \n\nThat makes THIS card REALLY, REALLY, REALLY good\u2026even if it costs you $550 per year. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Investors don\u2019t know how policies might change over the next few years - they don\u2019t know how tax rates might affect them - they don\u2019t know how to base their future projections - and because of that, most investors and analysts get a little more cautious and play it a LITTLE SAFER in case things don\u2019t turn out as they expect. \n\nLPL research in September here:\nhttps:\/\/lplresearch.com\/2020\/08\/31\/historic-august-opens-door-to-worst-month-of-the-year\/\nhttps:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/presidential-elections-and-stock-market-returns-2388526\n\nAnd also - this is probably the most relevant for a LOT of people watching - especially in terms of how NOT to lose money - and that all has to do with one word: DEBT. \n\nYahoo recently reported that 43% of retail traders are now trading with leverage\u2026if we break that down further, 23% are trading JUST using options, and 10% are JUST using margin\u2026signaling that MAYBE we\u2019re in the middle of an \u201coptions boom.\u201d\nhttps:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/43-of-retail-investors-are-trading-with-leverage-survey-172744302.html\n\nIn the last YEAR, options trading has increased in popularity by 45%\u2026and when we look back historically, we can see that options trading increased in volume over the last 12 months, and began their slow trickle upwards once Robinhood was introduced, and then once brokerages began offering free stock trading. \nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/b330e091-2a59-4527-b958-9213731a526c\n\nThat could explain some of the volatility in today\u2019s market - Goldman Sachs estimated that now, 20% of all SP500 options traded in the second quarter had a maturity of less than 24 hours, up from 5% in 2011-2016\u2026that means, people are leveraging their money 100x with short term, speculative bets on where the stock market is going to be headed in a 24 hour period. \nhttps:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/b330e091-2a59-4527-b958-9213731a526c\n\nThat leads to the notion that, POSSIBLY - tech options trading has influenced the entire market to rise up abnormally fast, and then plunge rather quickly as options traders bought up - and then SOLD their holdings. \n\nAnyway, I also think this would be a CRITICAL warning to any new investors out there to preferably NOT use leverage when buying stocks\u2026the fact that 43% of traders are using some margin or trading options is rather concerning, and I guarantee this can\u2019t end well and it\u2019s only a matter of time until the tables turn and people lose a LOT of money. \n\nSo, yeah - I mean, obviously, you know I\u2019m just going to say the same \u201cbuy and hold!\u201d that I\u2019ve been repeating for YEARS nonstop, even while the stock market was dropping 40%\u2026.if you\u2019ve watched more than a few of my videos by now, this isn\u2019t any surprise. But, I do want to use this as a time to caution you that you SHOULD be prepared for more volatility over the coming few months, you should understand how options trading is going to magnify these swings both positive and negative, and you should MAKE SURE you don\u2019t trade on margin or trade options UNLESS you really know what you\u2019re doing, or you have money that you can afford to lose. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Every day, Monday through Sunday at 6pm PST, they hold a drawing that picks a randomly generated number - and you can earn prizes depending how many numbers you match - all the way up to $10 million dollars.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the thing - the MORE people join the app, the lower the average interest rate becomes\u2026that\u2019s because the top prizes with an asterisk are SHARED depending how many people match those numbers at the same time as you.\n\nThese were my first impressions: \n\nOne, just seeing this upfront: the interest rate they pay is INCREDIBLE. From a Savings Account standpoint, AVERAGING higher than 2% interest rate is INSANE when almost every other bank is below 1%, and most are even lower than that\u2026HOWEVER, by the very nature of this - even though 2% is an AVERAGE interest rate across all prizes\u2026some people will inevitably earn much less than this, and others will earn WAY MORE. I\u2019d also expect that this rate is NOT going to be sustainable long term, and this is used as a way to gain momentum early on before - eventually - it\u2019s lowered. \n\nSecond, as of right now - it\u2019s ONLY a savings account, which means there aren\u2019t any other features besides the chance at earning a lot of money - and even though I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be adding on to this - don\u2019t expect to get a full on bank like you would with Ally Bank, at least not now. \n\nThird, I was rather disappointed to see that you\u2019re only able to link ONE bank account at a time to your Yotta Account for deposits and withdrawals, and it takes about 10 days for your money to clear in order for you to take it out. This is obviously for consumer protection, and I get it - but, still - this is something that should hopefully improve over time. \n\nFourth, for anyone wondering - they are FDIC Insured through Evolve Bank and Trust - so Yotta doesn\u2019t actually hold your money, Evolve Bank does. \nhttps:\/\/robinhood.com\/us\/en\/about\/cash-management\/\n\nAnd finally, fifth\u2026I\u2019m sure there might be skepticism about \u201cwhat if the prizes are rigged?! How do we know this isn\u2019t setup??\u201d And, to make sure this stays 100% above board, after some research, the top prizes are picked and paid out by a third party insurance company\u2026.that way, it\u2019s double-blind between the insurance and Yotta to make sure everything operates as it should and no one can purposely pick winning numbers.\n\nThis company is also featured on Bloomberg and backed by Y-Combinator, which is one of the most prestigious startup-accelerators in the world.\n\nThe business model behind it was quite intriguing\u2026.they\u2019re based on the report that 40% of Americans are unable to cover a $400 emergency expense, yet they spend $1000 per year on the Lottery\u2026.so Yotta aimed to bridge that gap by INCENTIVIZING people to save through a prize based system that makes it EXCITING to put money away, gives them a better interest rate than they\u2019d be getting at other banks, AND brings users back to the app on a regular basis to check in.\n\nIf you want to try it out and let me know what you think - it would mean a lot to me! To be clear: YES, it\u2019s a referral link and I DO get compensated as an investor in the company - but, I wouldn\u2019t recommend anything I don\u2019t use myself and don\u2019t thoroughly believe in! :)\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This goes much further than just relationships, by the way - this includes friends, colleagues, business parters, and acquaintances - if you LEAD and ATTRACT people with flashy clothing, cars, and status - you WILL ATTRACT THE PEOPLE who are most receptive to those qualities. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at: if you want to meet someone who thinks the same way as you do, who shares those same beliefs\u2026THAT\u2019S what you need to make known from the very beginning. Be EXACTLY who you are, and don\u2019t be apologetic about it\u2026if you embrace exactly what you\u2019re looking for, and you believe in what you\u2019re doing\u2026it\u2019s going to make it THAT much easier to find someone else who thinks the exact same way. \n\nI ALSO don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to place an emphasis on financial compatibility\u2026I know money has previously been this topic that no one talks about because it\u2019s not proper etiquette\u2026but, I think it\u2019s a very realistic component to any relationship, and logistically - when you\u2019re in a serious relationship - you need to be upfront with how you plan to manage finances, and whether or not your long term goals will clash with each other. \n\nAnd remember: this has NOTHING to do with how much money someone makes\u2026I\u2019ve seen people making $500,000 per year but they\u2019re the most financially irresponsible people who constantly live paycheck to paycheck\u2026just like I\u2019ve seen people who make $25,000 per year and somehow manage to save half of their income. \n\nThis IS JUST about Financial Responsibility, and setting the expectation and framework upfront about what works with you and what doesn\u2019t - generally, it\u2019s important that both people have a positive, health attitude towards finances - and as long as there\u2019s the emphasis towards working together towards a unified goal, how much money either person makes is largely irrelevant.\n\nAnd listen\u2026at the end of day, a relationship can bring an IMMENSE amount of joy into your life in so many immeasurable ways\u2026but, it\u2019s just as important to make sure you\u2019re attracting the type of people who are RIGHT for you, and being totally UPFRONT with who you are, what you want, and what you expect - without purposely doing things \u201cjust to get in a relationship.\u201d Ideally, I think it\u2019s just as important to learn to be completely comfortable on your own, first, so that you can build the confidence of becoming self sufficient as a person\u2026something like that just comes naturally, and everyone will move on their own timeline - there\u2019s no rush, and it\u2019s not a race. \n\nRelationships are an incredible learning and growing experience as a person, and it\u2019s NOT something to shy away from because you think money complicates things\u2026but, learning how to showcase who you are and what you stand for is a quality that not only a future partner will appreciate, but will also help shape you into a more confident person in general. The sooner you get in the habit of doing this, the easier it will be in the future.  \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The concern, however, is how sustainable IS this - what\u2019s going to happen when interest rates rise back up - and is there the worry of more inventory flooding the markets once mortgages in forbearance are able to be foreclosed?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say FOR SURE since there are SO many different factors at play like the local economy for each market, how much inventory there is, and its desirability\u2026but, we\u2019ll talk about AVERAGES here, overall\u2026and this is what was found:\n\nDespite what you would think, one study concluded that - historically - rising interest rates actually made NO DIFFERENCE, OVERALL, to the price of housing - in fact, since the 1980\u2019s, housing continued to rise even though mortgages rates went UP. \nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/IWE4chD.jpg\n\nAnother resource confirmed, this as well\u2026.analysis from Core Logic,  Freddie Mac, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that housing prices did INDEED go up, even though interest rates ALSO went up.\nhttps:\/\/edit.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/hfpcfig2_revised.png\nhttps:\/\/www.urban.org\/urban-wire\/when-interest-rates-go-healthy-economy-history-says-home-prices-will-rise\n\nThe reason for this is rather simple, though: One, interest rates are generally only increased in a good economy, where people are spending money, with consistent wage growth\u2026.which, typically means people are buying homes. \n\nAnd, TWO - interest rates are also increased to combat inflation, which as any real estate investor will know\u2026inflation is generally GOOD for real estate, because that also causes home price to rise up, in tandem.\n\nThe thing is, real estate is based on so many small factors, like location, inventory, the local job market, the health of the economy...and obviously, some markets will end up doing much BETTER than others. \n\nBut then there\u2019s also the concern of FORECLOSURES\u2026as it is right now, home owners have the option of opting in to mortgage forbearance, which allows them to temporarily \u201cpause\u201d their housing payments and then extend those missed payments to the end of the loan. During this time, forecloses are temporarily put on hold - and, beginning next year, we should begin to see the outcome of how many people can resume their payments. \n\nThe GOOD news is that, month after month, it actually looks like the amount of mortgages in forbearance has been steadily going down - and the latest finding was that, last month, loans in forbearance decreased from 7.2% to now 6.8%. \nhttp:\/\/www.mortgagenewsdaily.com\/09232020_black_knight_first_look.asp\n\nSo, in this case - EVEN THOUGH there are mortgages in forbearance\u2026it\u2019s unlikely that ALL of those are going to completely stop paying once the forbearance period is up, it\u2019s unlikely that EVERYONE is going to be selling at the same time, and it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019re going to crash the market. \n\nAll YOU need to be made aware of is that you ONLY buy a home that you can afford to live in LONG TERM, without the intention of selling. Generally, I don\u2019t recommend buying real estate without the intention of holding it at LEAST 10-20 years because ANYTHING can happen in the short term - but, as long as you buy something that you MAKE SURE you can afford, with a healthy emergency fund to cover you during a time of potential unemployment - then you should be okay. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Oh, but wait - there\u2019s more - you can unlock 30 days of 4x points for every friend you refer. You can earn an UNLIMITED amount of points, and they never expire. \n\nUnfortunately, It looks as though you can only redeem these points at pre-approved companies. But hey, if you\u2019re shopping at any one of these companies\u2026including....SUPREME\u2026then, yeah, each point is worth somewhere from 1-2 cents each, and that means this could potentially get you ALL THE WAY UP TO 8% back depending on how many people you refer. \n\nYou get all of this WITH a $0 annual fee\u2026.and that, I can\u2019t complain about. Anytime something is $0\u2026I approve. \n\nOverall, I gotta say - The X1 Credit Card IS a breath of fresh air - and, to be perfectly honest - I\u2019m not sure WHY there haven\u2019t been more \u201csmart credit cards\u201d coming into the market. \n\nIt seems, to me, like they\u2019ve just taken some broad concepts of the Apple Credit Card - and then just improved it a little bit, added some better features, and then re-marketed it down to a millennial and Gen Z audience - which I think it\u2019s SMART. \n\nThe No Annual Fee thing is really nice, the point system is REALLY good but ONLY if you\u2019re using your points towards they\u2019re pre-approved companies, and I don\u2019t see a many downsides with this card..If you can get up to 8% cash back on those merchants at a value of 8 cents per point, that\u2019s higher than nearly anything else out there. \n\nI also gotta say, I like the features with this card\u2026and if they can integrate some type of personal finance payment tracker on the card, I think it\u2019ll be a clear rival with some of the other no-annual fee credit cards out there...so, I like it.\n\nMy ONLY criticism, however, is that it looks like points can only be redeemed through select merchants, which I\u2019m not a huge fan of\u2026BUT, if this gets people IN the credit card game with a higher limit upfront based on income, I\u2019m all for it - and I think this will be a good step in the right direction to begin digitalizing credit cards. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

I also hired a full time assistant and editor for the second channel, so that way I can make sure nothing falls through. \n\nI\u2019ve also started a podcast with the help of my colleague and editor, Jack, called The Iced Coffee Hour \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely unreal to even think something like this is possible, and that I get to spend every day doing something that I find so fulfilling and fun\u2026and I owe all of that to YouTube for making this possible, and YOU watching this for all of your support on the channel. I could NOT have done this without you, and I\u2019m just happy to be able to give you the information you want me to make, and do my best to bring about more financial awareness and show people how personal finance and building credit can be fun. \n\nBut, seriously - ALL of this is because of you, so thank you - and that\u2019s why I always do my best to read the comments, respond to as many of you as I can, and listen when you say something - I love that we\u2019ve built such a supportive community where we all want each other to succeed, because it\u2019s very true - a rising tide lifts all boats, and if we learn something new, it\u2019s up to us to share that with each other and do our best to help everyone succeed.\n\nMy content is far from perfect, I make mistakes, and I\u2019m human\u2026but, I love making videos, I like sharing information, I love investing, and if I can encourage you to do the same, then I\u2019ve done what I\u2019ve set out to do\u2026.and lastly, if you\u2019ve made it this far in the video, it would mean a lot to me if you gave it a like. It helps out the algorithm, and if we can get this video in front of people who find it helpful\u2026it would make me really happy.

This competition means employers don\u2019t NEED to increase salaries, because they have no problem filling those positions with people willing to work. \n\nAnd even though there CAN be benefits of getting a college degree\u2026and it CAN be a pre-requisite for securing a job\u2026it\u2019s certainly becoming a lot more common, and therefore, less impactful towards getting a boost in salary. Studies have shown that the value of a college degree really seemed to have peaked in the late 1990\u2019s\u2026and since then, it\u2019s been a slow decline given the skyrocketing cost of education. \nhttps:\/\/www.epi.org\/publication\/charting-wage-stagnation\/\n\nAlso, during a recession, employers are often quick to cut and decrease salaries\u2026but during the GOOD TIMES, they\u2019re much SLOWER to raise them back up. And  again - the data backs this up, showing that we\u2019re just NOW getting back to the point we were at\u202610 years ago.  \nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/fredgraph.png?width=880&height=440&id=MEHOINUSA672N\n\nThat means that, today\u2026we have to be more careful than ever to seriously evaluate the benefits of college, and whether or not it\u2019s worth it for the career you want. Most likely, less expensive options, trade schools, or community college would be a better fit instead of pouring money into a 4-year private education\u2026but as it stands right now, more money spent on schooling, combined with lower wages\u2026equals less money can be put towards building wealth.\n\nIt\u2019s also INCREDIBLY important to realize that, at the end of the day - all the income in the world won\u2019t help if you don\u2019t consistently SAVE AND INVEST, so that way, you can participate in the markets going up in value over time. As it is now, income and wealth seems to be self fulfilling\u2026the people who make more money, invest more\u2026and because they invest more\u2026they make more money. \n\nLikewise, the opposite happens when you don\u2019t have money\u2026you don\u2019t make as much, you don\u2019t invest, and because you don\u2019t invest\u2026you don\u2019t make as much. It\u2019s so important to break that cycle and start investing AS SOON AS POSSIBLE\u2026even if it means cutting back on extravagances, switching jobs, working a side hustle, or doing ANYTHING YOU CAN just to get in the game\u2026it\u2019s so important just to start, and stay as consistent as you can. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is the same WHEREVER you live in the United States, this is all the same for everyone\u2026except Puerto Rico, but that\u2019s the topic for another video. \n\nNOW\u2026In ADDITION to paying FEDERAL INCOME TAXES\u2026almost every state has an income tax that you owe THEM, completely separate from the IRS. As you can see from the chart, some states have ZERO income tax - like Texas, Nevada, Tennessee, Florida, Washington, and so on\u2026and others range anywhere from a few percent all the way to 13.3%.\n\nNow, if we approach this from PURELY a TAX STANDPOINT - Las Vegas does not have ANY state income tax\n\nI was able to get a fixed mortgage at 2.875% interest, with 15% down, for 30 years, at a $1,440,000 purchase price. That means my monthly mortgage is going to be $5,078 per month, my property taxes will be about $1050 per month, the HOA is $300 per month, and my home owners insurance is $200 per month. \n\nThat means my TOTAL out of pocket cost to own this home is $6,628 per month\u2026however, when you pay a mortgage, a portion of that goes towards home equity as you pay down the loan\u2026meaning, when you account for $2150 per month going towards home equity, my \u201ctotal out of pocket\u201d is ACTUALLY reduced to $4,478 per month to own this home.\n\nNot only that, but because I\u2019m planning to use half of the house exclusively for business and filming, HALF of that amount is a write off against my gross income - bringing my out of pocket cost, after tax write offs\u2026to $3582 PER MONTH to own this home. \n\nThat means that, even though this house had a purchase price of $1,440,000 and it\u2019s costing, NET, $3582 per month after write offs\u2026not only do I get an extra 2000 square feet to create new filming locations from, but I\u2019m also able to SAVE $33,000 PER MONTH since Las Vegas has no state income tax. \n\nNow, of course - for anyone curious, YES, I WILL STILL OWE California State Income tax on ANY revenue generated from and in California. That means that all of my rental property income in California will be subject to State Income Tax, and any business I do in California will be carefully accounted for so I can pay the appropriate tax. But, because nearly everything else that I do can be done remotely - moving here gives me significantly more opportunity to continue growing and expanding, and bringing YOU even better content to watch day after day.\n\nThis is certainly not to say that EVERYONE can do this because there are a lot of factors to take into consideration\u2026but, for me, that is how I broke down the math with how it pertains to myself and this home. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

But, for those people who simply can\u2019t cut back any further than they already are\u2026then it\u2019s up to you to make up the difference through a part time job, switching careers, learning a new skill, or doing anything else you can to increase your income. Thinking about investing at this point is NOT going to have as high of an ROI as increasing your income - so finding any extra work should be a priority, until you can get to the point where you have a little left over to consistently save and invest. \n\nStep 2: Make sure you FIRST build up a 3-6 month E-fund. \nThis is just a \u201cSavings Account\u201d with money that you keep, in cash, to cover 3-6 months worth of your expenses in the event something happens, you lose your job, the money printer stops going BRRRR, and they still can\u2019t agree on a Stimulus Deal\u2026at least you\u2019d have 3-6 months worth of cash on hand to cover your overhead until you get yourself back on your feet. \n\nStep 3: Use $100 per week towards maxing out your Roth IRA. \nThis is a tax advantaged retirement account that lets you contribute post tax money\u2026meaning taxes have already been taking out of what you earned\u2026and by the time you\u2019re 59.5, all the PROFIT in that account can be accessed completely tax free. \n\nStep 4: Another Alternative to a Roth IRA is the potential of investing in what\u2019s called a 401k\u2026and, depending on your employer, this one could be EVEN BETTER than the Roth IRA. \nThis is an account that you invest PRE-TAX money into, and then you\u2019re taxed when you begin withdrawing the money after the age of 59.5. From my perspective, the 401k really only makes sense in a few scenarios:\n\n-The first is when your employer offers what\u2019s called a 401K match\u2026this is when they will match your contribution, dollar-for-dollar, up to a certain amount. \n\n-Secondly, a 401k makes sense if you\u2019re in a REALLY HIGH tax bracket now\u2026and expect to retire on much less, in a LOWER tax bracket , \n\nStep 5: Use this extra money to pay down any high interest rate debt you have. \nPaying down debt is like getting a guaranteed return on your money at whatever interest rate you\u2019re paying - because, otherwise, if you didn\u2019t pay it down - it\u2019s COSTING you whatever the interest rate is. \n\nStep 6: Spend $100 per week investing back in yourself. \nHere\u2019s the thing - when you look at the initial ROI of investing $100 per week, in the very beginning, it\u2019s not much. Even if you get an INCREDIBLE 20% return within a year, we\u2019re talking about MAYBE $1000 in profit\u2026well, that could very well PALE in comparison towards what YOU could do for yourself. \n\nStep 7: Invest $100 Per Week in a taxable brokerage account. \nBy doing this, you\u2019d have access to ALL of your money, anytime you need it, without paying an penalties for cashing out before the age of 59.5\u2026HOWEVER, all profits will be taxed, which is why I recommend you familiarize yourself with the benefits of long term capital gains taxes, and understand which bracket you fall under so you can best understand how much you will owe if you sell. \n\nStep 8: Use this money towards your own business that has the potential to generate even more money. \nSimilar to investing in yourself, THIS is an area where $100 per week could have an INSANELY high ROI. \n\nStep 9: Hit the like button :)\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Yet, while investor confidence in the market is low, stock prices are trading at very high levels.\u2019\nhttps:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/stock-market-outlook-crash-risk-shiller-investor-confidence-high-prices-2020-10-1029721688#\n\nOn top of that, Robert Shiller also has what\u2019s known as a VALUATION INDEX\u2026which surveys those same people and asks if they think the market is undervalued, overvalued, or just the right price. And, as we can see from the chart - only 37% of individuals feel the market is undervalued\u2026.\nhttps:\/\/som.yale.edu\/faculty-research-centers\/centers-initiatives\/international-center-for-finance\/data\/stock-market-confidence-indices\/united-states-stock-market-confidence-indices\n\nThat means\u2026according to Robert Shiller\u2026the vast majority of investors feel like a market crash is MORE than 10% likely to happen, during a time where 63% of investors feel the market valuations are high. I mean, it isn\u2019t exactly rocket science here and this doesn\u2019t exactly make any predictions - BUT, it does give us a gauge on MARKET SENTIMENT, which could have a direct impact on where the market MIGHT be headed in the coming few months. \n\nNEXT: Bond Rates Are Rising. This all started the other week when the 10-year-bond prices began to increase pass .8%\u2026for the first time in many months, and the assumption is that - at this rate - the 10-year prices could soon reach that psychological threshold of 1%. \n\nRates like this are rising with the expectation that - more likely than not - another stimulus is coming, and when that happens, the US will have averted any short term issues that could come up, meaning that long term bonds are able to pay MORE as fewer investors buy them - as we\u2019re seeing here. I know that sounds INCREDIBLY confusing, and I\u2019ve simplified things a LOT\u2026but, when you think of these interest rates, all you need to know is that it\u2019s all about supply and demand. \n\nSee, as these bond yields go up - banks need to INCREASE mortgage rates to remain competitive to the investors who buy those loans\u2026therefore, the higher this bond rate goes\u2026the more likely it is that we\u2019ll begin to see interest rates SLOWLY begin to tick back up for mortgages, as well. \n\nNow, it\u2019s still too early to tell FOR SURE what type of impact this is going to have on the housing market, or if this type of rate increase is only going to be minuscule for the time begin\u2026but, either way, the likelihood of mortgage rates dropping any lower than they are today is unlikely. \n\nOverall, though - here\u2019s what YOU need to do about this: FOCUS ON WHAT YOU CAN DIRECTLY CONTROL. Obviously, go out and vote so your voice is heard - that\u2019s an easy one. But, besides that - volatility like this is going to be normal over the next few weeks to months, and it\u2019s up to you to have an understanding of what this means for you, and to make sure you\u2019re diversified enough NOT TO PANIC AND SELL. \n\nAnd, listen\u2026regardless of what happens, long term, the markets have shown us that they will do just fine long term.

It was \u201cinvented\u201d back in 1994 and used as a method of calculation to make sure you NEVER run out of money in retirement\u2026or basically, if you want to have endless amounts of passive income forever\u2026this tells you how much you need, and how much you can spend. \n\nBut now\u2026according to the INVENTOR of the rule itself\u2026he says the 4% rule is no more\u2026and instead, he\u2019s recommending a change. \n\nHe says,  NOW, that \u201che no longer sticking to 4%, and that that number was always treated too simplistically.\u201d Because of that, he says 5% is still pretty safe\u2026.if anything, 4.5% is now the new \u201cWorst case scenario\u201d and 7% can be safe for the AVERAGE 30 year retirement. \n\nOne is from the popular finance blogger, Financial Samurai\u2026he\u2019s outspoken in his claims about the legitimacy of spending 4% per year, and says it was established at a time when the 10-year bond yield averaged 5%. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/the-new-savings-target-for-a-modest-retirement-8-million-2020-08-17\n\nSo, I THINK\u2026in fairness here, I\u2019ll break down my OWN calculations independent from everyone else\u2026and I\u2019ll give my thoughts, as someone who makes YouTube videos from their home all day. \n\nSo, first\u2026in order to do this, we\u2019ve gotta take a look at what\u2019s called a \u201crolling 30 year return\u201d of the SP500\u2026this is basically the AVERAGE return that you\u2019re going to get, over any 30 year timeframe, and by doing this, we\u2019ll be able to find the best and worst case scenarios for your money. \n\nWe\u2019ll start with this chart, they found that a 20-year stock market has NEVER ONCE produced a negative result, adjusted for inflation, in HISTORY\u2026and the WORST CASE SCENARIO, EVER REALIZED\u2026was a .5% average return adjusted for inflation.\nhttps:\/\/www.visualcapitalist.com\/stock-market-returns-time-periods-1872-2018\/\n\nAnother chart found that, on a 30 year rolling period, the WORST CASE SCENARIO was an 8% annual return, before inflation, and the best case was nearly 15% before inflation. \nhttps:\/\/awealthofcommonsense.com\/2016\/05\/deconstructing-30-year-stock-market-returns\/\n\nAnd a third chart shows the worst possible 30-year rolling period was 4.3% after inflation - again, that would\u2019ve been during the 1960\u2019s. \nhttp:\/\/www.theretirementcafe.com\/2012\/09\/30-year-rolling-stock-market-return.html\n\nGiven all of this information\u2026if you\u2019re looking at a 30 year retirement and you want to be 100% safe in the worst possible case scenario given ALL of the historical data we have available to us over 130 years\u2026spending 4% annually would be okay. \n\nAlthough my BIG CRITIQUE here is that, IF you want to retire early, and have LONGER than a 30-year retirement\u2026then you\u2019re probably safest to aim closer to 3%-4% withdrawal rate because you\u2019ll need that money to last you a lot longer. That way, even IF the market doesn\u2019t return as much as it did historically\u2026you\u2019d be able to budget appropriately so you don\u2019t run out. \n\nThe metric we should use is that it\u2019s OKAY to spend 3-6% of your portfolio annually, IF you\u2019re willing to cut back on your spending in the event the market goes down, or if the markets aren\u2019t producing as much as you thought it would. \n\nAnd really, all of this should be used as purely a rule of thumb, and by understanding the math behind what this is and what it does\u2026you\u2019ll be able to better budget how much you\u2019ll need to save and invest. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

From an INVESTMENT standpoint, it\u2019s often considered a GOOD thing because any measures would need bipartisan support to pass through - which means, both sides would need to come to an agreement in order to get to the next step\u2026and, as of now, this is fairly balanced.  \n\nWith a divided congress like this, it\u2019s UNLIKELY that we\u2019ll see higher taxes, strict business regulation, or a change in capital gains tax, which was weighing on investors who couldn\u2019t plan for that uncertainty. Keep in mind, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not IMPOSSIBLE for things like this to happen\u2026but, it\u2019s UNLIKELY if congress isn\u2019t fully unified towards one side or the other. \n\nObliviously, past results aren\u2019t always going to be indicative of what actually happens\u2026but, HISTORICALLY\u2026the highest returns came from a D-President, with house and senate split between parties\u2026.at an average annual return of 13.6%. A close runner up was a D-President and R-congress, at 13%\u2026and nearly tied with R-President and Congress, at 12.9%. \nhttps:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/11\/03\/are-republicans-or-democrats-better-for-the-stock-market.html\n\nUltimately, what it SEEMS to favor - HISTORICALLY - is that a divided congress is best for the markets\u2026and if you are concerned about stock market returns, it\u2019s more opportunistic to pay attention to the SENATE AND HOUSE, instead of the president. See here:\nhttps:\/\/static3.businessinsider.com\/image\/5f04c9e62618b979585744e5-803\/lpl-chart.jpg\n\nSo really, at the end of the day..the presidency has less control over the markets than we think, and REALLY\u2026we should place a bigger focus on our house and senate, and making sure we have an even representation for BOTH SIDES\u2026not necessarily favoring one, or the other.\n\nBut\u2026given all of that information, THIS is why we\u2019re seeing the stock market go up...a clear outcome is beginning to develop that would still favor business and relatively lower taxation, and tech regulation\u2026.leading to people piling back into the stock market. Or, in other words\u2026more people are buying than selling, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s green. \n\nI\u2019ve just always maintained that the BEST thing you can do is simply focus on the core principles that I say a million times over and over again in my videos\u2026keep buying, keep investing long term, and don\u2019t panic. \n\nThe president should not dictate how you save your money, live below your means, and invest\u2026sure, policies might have some affect\u2026but, for a majority of it\u2026I believe you are in direct control of your own personal finances and how you manage them with good, long term consistent habits\n\nWe could very well see the markets continue to blow higher and higher, or it could go down once uncertainty comes back about who gains the senate\u2026but either way, you better be buying :) \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Now, keep in mind - this isn\u2019t the first time a treatment has gone through S-3 trials\u2026and Pfizer is still unsure of how long the protection lasts, so further tests need to be done. HOWEVER\u2026even though there are still questions up in the air and it needs final approval from the FDA\u2026it\u2019s a REALLY good sign\u2026and if it works exactly as described\u2026this will open up a LOT of new doors for the entire economy. \n\nWith the news of a potential treatment, the RECOVERY stocks are the ones who have benefited the most\u2026these are the businesses that got hit the hardest because of the shut down, like restaurants, airlines, hotels, the travel industry, or anything involving a physical location. \n\nBut, with every winner\u2026is also a loser\u2026companies that dominated the online space, like Zoom, Etsy, Amazon, and Shopify\u2026are all down, because there\u2019s less of a \u201cpush\u201d for people to continue using online services. The assumption here is that, once the economy begins to re-open\u2026there could be a big rotation of money moving away from tech, and into \u201cre-opening\u201d stocks and in-person businesses\u2026it\u2019s still too early to tell, although\u2026 OVERALL\u2026the market is up MASSIVELY with this news, leading us to hit a BRAND NEW ALL TIME HIGH. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve talked about this before, but it\u2019s worth mentioning again: timing the market is one of the worst things you could do. \n\nStudies have shown that, time and time again\u2026the BEST strategy for investing is to dump your money into the market as soon as you have it, and then\u2026KEEP IT THERE. Vanguard found that, 67% of the time\u2026just dumping your money into the markets will get you a HIGHER RETURN than if you just slowly trickled your money in\u2026otherwise known as \u201cdollar cost averaging.\u201d Even though, sure, there might be a 1-in-3 chance that this is less profitable\u2026you NEVER know what\u2019s in store for the future, and if anyone offers you a 2-in-3 chance of making more money\u2026you should probably take it. \nhttps:\/\/static.twentyoverten.com\/5980d16bbfb1c93238ad9c24\/rJpQmY8o7\/Dollar-Cost-Averaging-Just-Means-Taking-Risk-Later-Vanguard.pdf\n\nSecond, after you invest your money\u2026just keep it there. Fidelity found that, over 40 years\u2026a $10,000 investment in the SP500 would have grown to $697,000 if you just KEPT THE MONEY INVESTED WITHOUT TOUCHING IT. However, if you missed just the BEST 5 DAYS\u2026.over 40 years\u2026your return would diminish by over $265,000. \nhttps:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/bin-public\/060_www_fidelity_com\/documents\/dont-miss-best-days.pdf\nhttps:\/\/www.thesimpledollar.com\/investing\/stocks\/tempted-to-sell-missing-just-a-handful-of-the-best-stock-market-days-can-tank-your-returns\/\n\nThat should really go to show you that, STATISTICALLY SPEAKING\u2026if you have money sitting on the sidelines, you\u2019re losing out on the potential for that money to continue growing. And by selling OUT of your investments, or trying to time the market\u2026you risk missing out on those rare BEST DAYS that could severely impact your overall return. \n\nEven the argument \u201cBUT THE MARKET IS AT IT\u2019S ALL TIME HIGH\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026because, NATURALLY, the markets will always be hitting new all time highs. There will always be new all time highs time and time again\u2026and, in 30 years from now, I can say with almost 100% certainty\u2026the markets will be significantly higher than they are right now. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And worst case - even if it DOESN\u2019T sell\u2026you\u2019re out NOTHING, and you get to keep what you already have. \n\nSECOND: FOCUS GROUPS\nCompanies want YOUR opinion on their upcoming products or services so that, once they go to market, they better understand EXACTLY what the customer wants. So, they hire focus groups to get unbiased feedback of what they have to offer\u2026and then they can make adjustments accordingly. The payout ranges depending on how long it takes, whether or not it\u2019s online or in person, or how niche of a demographic they\u2019re going for\u2026but, most of the time, if you have nothing else going on, these are worth your time to do. \n\nTHIRD: FLIPPING FREE ITEMS ON CRAIGSLIST\nFor example, go to Craigslist\u2026and under the \u201cFOR SALE\u201d section, there\u2019s something that has my favorite word listed there\u2026it\u2019s FREE. Most of what you see if going to be a diamond in the rough, and it\u2019s up to you to know what to look for and how to market it online before you sell it. \n\nFOURTH: PART TIME JOB\nTraditionally, if you want to earn a little extra money, part time work is generally the first thing that comes to mind. It doesn\u2019t need to be glamorous, it doesn\u2019t need to pay an exorbitant amount\u2026but, if you\u2019re willing to help out a local business, do some work for someone else, or earn some money after normal hours\u2026see what kind of options are available in your city. \n\nFIFTH: CHURNING CREDIT CARDS. \nThis is the practice in which you sign up for a new credit card - and then you meet the minimum spend to get the sign up bonus. Generally, these offers range anywhere from $100-$150 on the low end, all the way up to over $1300 on the \u201chigh end luxury cards\u201d - but, regardless, doing this takes next to no time at all, long term - it can help your credit score - and, hey, who doesn\u2019t like getting free stuff?\n\nSIXTH: MONETIZING A SKILL\nFind your monetizable skill, see what you\u2019re good at\u2026and then charge for those services. Chances are, you\u2019re good at SOMETHING\u2026so, either tutoring, offering your expertise, or lending your knowledge will go a long way\u2026all for $0. \n\nSEVENTH: MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS. \nI know, guys\u2026it\u2019s not easy to make money on YouTube, and it takes a TON of work\u2026like, if you want to make money anytime soon, I\u2019ll tell you - upfront, you\u2019re basically going to work for free. You\u2019re going to be creating a TON of totally free videos without getting anything in return, while people tell you how much your content sucks in the very beginning\u2026but, IF you enjoy making YouTube videos and you have something you want to share, you CAN turn this into a side hobby that eventually turns a profit, without spending any money. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

For me, it was the option of NOT needing to take work that I didn\u2019t thoroughly like. I had the OPTION to pursue the endeavors I found the mot fulfilling and meaningful. I had the option to SAY NO to things that didn\u2019t align with my priorities, and that - in turn - meant I could focus on what I was most excited about, and when that happened - oddly enough, I ended up making more money as a byproduct of thoroughly enjoying what I do, because that gave me the motivation to continue pushing even further. \n\nThat would NEVER have been possible had I built a life of high overhead, excessive spending, and luxury that I never needed in the first place, because that\u2019s NOT the most effective way for money to be used - and by living really frugally and saving nearly everything I made, this type of choice became possible. From my experience, the REAL enjoyment doesn\u2019t come from buying things\u2026it just comes from having the OPTION to buy them, if you wanted to. \n\nAnd no, this isn\u2019t to say that I don\u2019t spend money on anything\u2026because that\u2019s absolutely not the case\u2026.I now treat myself to sushi twice a month. BUT, that\u2019s why I do my best to ONLY spend the money I make from my investments, and if there\u2019s something I want one day\u2026I\u2019ll make sure I have enough invested to completely pay for it, otherwise\u2026I\u2019ll just continue saving. \n\nThat\u2019s how, over time - I\u2019ve gradually started spending a little more money and increasing my lifestyle, and then I can continue my current lifestyle of re-investing everything else, so that the investments can support whatever OTHER endeavors I choose for the future. \n\nBecause I totally believe it\u2019s ok to spend more money, to do nicer things, to accumulate more \u201cstuff,\u201d and to give in to a moderate amount of lifestyle inflation\u2026IF it\u2019s something that\u2019s sustainable. And for me, stepping it up a little bit each year is totally fine as my investments grow in value and throw off a little more income. As long as I keep my spending at THAT level, I\u2019m ok with it. \n\nBy structuring my spending this way, I know my current level of spending is sustainable - and knowing that, it gives me the freedom to continue working on whatever I enjoy the most, and having the OPTION to pursue whatever I\u2019d like - even if it isn\u2019t the most financially lucrative. \n\nNow, in terms of HOW I SPEND MY money\u2026lately, my mindset has begun to shift;\n\nFor the first time in my entire life, I\u2019ve begun to prioritize \u201cbuying back my time\u201d - in the sense that, now, I can hire an editor on my second channel so that it frees up more time during the day to focus on here. I was able to happy to pay him as a driver so I can edit my main channel videos on the go. I\u2019ve begun to realize that there\u2019s only so much I can do on my own - and by outsourcing work, I have my time back to continue growing and expanding in ways that just weren\u2019t possible before. To me, buying \u201cback my time\u201d is more important than any car, house, or \u201cthing\u201d that I could buy - because time is something that really is priceless. \n\nSo that\u2019s why I save pretty much everything I make, while only spending what my investments make - because that gives me the most choice as to what I do day to day. And today, my choice is to ask you for a second time to smash that like button :)\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

And that just means a constant, steady stream of money flowing into Tesla stock.\n\nHistorically, here's what happens when a stock is added to an index:\n\nNow, when it was researched, it was found that stocks DO generally see a rise in price once it\u2019s ANNOUNCED they\u2019re going to be added to an index - but ONCE they\u2019re actually added to the index, the pent up demand slows down - the stock price drops - and then it returns it a new \u201cnormal.\u201d\u00a0\nhttps:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/article\/4009991-index-front-running-happens-stock-added-index\n\nThis was also confirmed by a study published in the 1990\u2019s, that found that the announcement and inclusion of a stock within the SP500 DID have a measurable effect on the price\u2026short term.\u00a0Long term, however, it was found that adding a stock to an index has no permanent effect on the price. \nhttp:\/\/people.stern.nyu.edu\/alynch\/pdfs\/jb97lm.pdf\n\nIn fact, it was studied that a stocks \u201cpremium\u201d for being added to an index completely wore off after 2 months, usually returning to the same price before it was ever announced.\u00a0\nhttps:\/\/www.wealthdaily.com\/articles\/the-indexing-effect\/90018\n\nAnd overall, studies have shown that stocks added to an index did NOT see any superior performance and demand over stocks which were NOT traded within an index\u2026\nhttps:\/\/repository.upenn.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=joseph_wharton_scholars\n\nSo, given all of this information\u2026like we\u2019re seeing right now\u2026the ANNOUNCEMENT is increasing the stock price, just as studies have shown was going to happen\u2026and, historically, that announcement has a more powerful impact than the actual inclusion itself. \n\nIf you\u2019re investing in this specific stock, just be prepared for this to be a wild ride. It\u2019s not uncommon for this one to be up or down 10% in a few days, so understand WHY you bought in and just hold as long as nothing fundamentally changes. If you buy into Tesla, buy with the expectation of holding this for YEARS\u2026and then hang on. \n\nOtherwise, if you\u2019re investing in index funds like I preach nonstop here\u2026well, congrats, just over 1% of your portfolio is now going to be Tesla. This isn\u2019t exactly enough to make waves in your portfolio\u2026BUT, it could have a decent impact long term if it continues to do well. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

I AM A RANDOM GUY ON YOUTUBE MAKING VIDEOS IN A SPARE BEDROOM. DON\u2019T LISTEN TO ME. CONSULT A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL FOR ANY TAX ADVICE.*\n\nAlright, so there FIRST, most straight forward \u201ctax deduction\u201d out there is just called \u201cThe Standard Deduction.\u201d\nThis is, BY FAR, the most common tax saving strategy out there, and it\u2019s almost always going to be \u201cautomatically applied\u201d by even the most basic of tax softwares. This gives people the option to reduce taxable income by $12,400 if you\u2019re single, or $24,800 if you\u2019re married.\n\nAfter that, you also have a VERY popular one called a Traditional 401K retirement plan. \nThis is an employer-sponsored plan that allows you to invest PRE-TAX money, and then you\u2019re taxed when you begin withdrawing the money after the age of 59.5. For example, if you invest $100 per week into a 401K, you\u2019ll be taxed as though you make $100 per week LESS on your paycheck. \n\nBut once we go beyond the basics\u2026.where the tax code REALLY shines is for business owners. The REALITY is that here in the United States, self employed business owners have the benefit of getting a LOT of tax deductions and write offs available to them to bring down their taxable income. \n\nThe first, like I mentioned in my previous video, is running your business as an S-Corporation. This is a legal entity that you can set up, and then\u2026that S-Corporation becomes your \u201cemployer,\u201d which you just happen to own 100% of. The advantage of this is that you can designate yourself a \u201cSalary,\u201d which your S-Corp pays you\u2026and then, your remaining profits are received as corporate distribution, which is not subject to the 15.3% of payroll tax. \n\nIn addition to that, when you own a business - items spent DIRECTLY on that business are generally a \u201cwrite off\u201d against your income. If you incur any expense relating to that business generating PROFIT, it\u2019s reduced from your gross income and you will pay less in taxes as a result. \n\nAlright, now\u2026as for myself\u2026and why I owe the IRS about $1.5 million this year: when you\u2019re self employed, you\u2019re responsible for paying what\u2019s called \u201cestimated taxes.\u201d\n\nWhen you don\u2019t make quarterly estimated payments to the IRS, you\u2019re hit with an annualized penalty of 3-5% of the amount you\u2019re supposed to pay. And for me, I found it MORE PROFITABLE to pay that penalty and have the ability invest that money upfront, instead, during a time where the markets were down.\n\nThat\u2019s allowed me to have more free cashflow to move around banks and negotiate a lower mortgage interest rate, I\u2019ve put more money into the stock market, and I\u2019ve had more overall mobility rather than paying that money to the IRS upfront. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

We also have the possibility for further shut downs. \n\n3. As we\u2019ve heard time and time again\u2026the stock market is not the economy, and it\u2019s becoming increasingly disconnected from the day to day reality. \n\n4. And fourth\u2026there\u2019s the concern that people won\u2019t spend as much money as they once did\u2026leading to lower corporate profits. \n\nGOOD NEWS for the stock market:\n\n1. We got some talks about a pretty substantial vaccine that COULD be coming soon, if everything goes according to plan\u2026and once that happens, our economy could very well return to kind -of normal. \n\n2. There\u2019s the notion that IF the economy gets too bad\u2026the Federal Reserve and government will step in to boost it up. \n\n3. Because we\u2019ve already had time to process a lot of the information\u2026I doubt that, if we DO have a drop\u2026it\u2019s going to be as sudden and severe as what we saw back in March. \n\n4. There\u2019s already a LOT of \u201cbad news\u201d priced into the markets. \n\n5. Fifth, as our economy EVENTUALLY re-opens\u2026we could see a big resurgence towards \u201cRecovery Stocks.\u201d \n\nI have a feeling we will continue on a similar trajectory, but on a smaller scale. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have the same levels of worry and euphoria as we\u2019ve seen this year\u2026and maybe that\u2019s a good thing\u2026but I think 2021 is going to bring us a LOT more stability now that a lot of the unforeseen surprises are out of the way. \n\nMy own investment strategy next year is to continue to plow most of my money back into index funds and just let them grow. If the market is down, great - I buy cheaper - if the market is up - great - I\u2019m making money\u2026so, either way, it\u2019s a win. I\u2019ll be buying a LOT of the SP500\u2026I\u2019ll be picking up the occasional individual stock if something comes my way or looks interesting\u2026but, the bulk of what I do is just a boring SP500 index fund, unless a good real estate deal comes along\u2026but, I haven\u2019t seen anything lately\u2026so, more index funds it is. \n\nI\u2019d also be fairly optimistic on renewable green energies and bio tech\u2026I know those have seen a CRAZY run\u2026but, I think as we continue to shift to green markets, electric vehicles, and more sustainability\u2026I think those should continue to do really well. Even California wants to go fully electric by 2035\u2026and that could be a huge push in that direction. \n\nBut, honestly\u2026I\u2019m a fairly boring investor\u2026I just believe it\u2019s all about doing the same things over and over again, repetitively\u2026regardless of what happens in the short term\u2026but, this upcoming year\u2026I THINK we\u2019ll see more green than red\u2026and more ups than downs. Basically, I\u2019m thinking we\u2019re likely to see another positive year. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This study analyzed almost 4,900 of these \u201cherding events,\u201d and found that 63% of the time, selling right after the price goes up, and then buying back in 5 days later, resulted in a 3.5% above market return. \n\nFirst of all, DON\u2019T EVER jump into a stock just because you see it going up in price. There\u2019s enough research that suggests, at this point - jumping into a hype stock is a bad idea, prone to a quick reversal, if you jump in too late\u2026which, chances are, by the time you see it on the top movers list - it\u2019s already too late. \n\nSecond, NEVER buy into a stock without having researched the company to the point where you know how they make money, you understand their basic fundamentals, and you invest an amount where you still have enough left over to be properly diversified. \n\nThird, yes - there ARE a small subset of people who are profiting from this information by shorting stocks and then buying them back at a lower price, but for 99.999% of people watching - I don\u2019t recommend it. \n\nRobinhood is still a good platform to use and they changed the game with $0 stock trades\u2026.but, their easy, game-like design also poses a threat to people who have no clue what they\u2019re doing and just buy into the trends. \n\nInstead, I\u2019d just recommend people stick with the basics: smash the like button, invest diversified funds long term, keep buying consistently, and hold for as long as you can.\n \nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

The HOPE is that this money could INSTEAD be used towards helping small businesses and unemployment\u2026instead of helping out big corporations in need of cheap money.  \n\nThe main concern when it comes to all of us, is that the PURPOSE of this entire fund - as I mentioned - was just to make investors feel safer about investing and lending money. One of the major reasons that the stock market STOPPED DROPPING was the FED coming in and, inadvertently, propping up the economy by \u201cdoing whatever it takes to keep it afloat.\u201d \n\nAs of now, EVEN THOUGH - YES, cases are rising, unemployment is still high, and we might continue to see further shut downs\u2026the MARKETS are working as expected\u2026investors have felt more comfortable, companies are beginning to stabilize, a vaccine is on the horizon\u2026and, we\u2019re SLOWLY getting through this. This \u201cprogram\u201d was designed to grease the wheels, so to speak, that was it.  \n\nSo, long story short\u2026even though this money WAS used as a \u201cTraining Wheel\u201d of sorts to keep the economy moving on\u2026the Treasury is taking the side that the markets are strong enough to move on their own, they don\u2019t need all of this money just sitting there, and NOW - we can re-purpose it potentially something else. \n\nThe biggest RISK that I see is that, IF something were to happen\u2026and we encounter another March-Like panic\u2026then, we won\u2019t have the same backstops we do now because we wouldn\u2019t have the FED to step in and say \u201cDON\u2019T WORRY, EVERYONE\u2026We got cash, how much you need?\u201d\u2026.BUT, that\u2019s not to say that we can\u2019t reinstate these LATER IF NEEDED, albeit it will probably take a little more time to go back into effect. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

When you refinance a mortgage, you\u2019re doing so because you want to lower your payment\u2026and even though a .5% fee means less money back to you\u2026in most cases, you\u2019re still saving money at the end of the day. \n\nAnd lastly\u2026let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going on with mortgage forbearances:\n\nThe GOOD news is that, since April\u2026the total number of loans in forbearance has been steadily decreasing week after week, as homeowners began making their payments again. This was a REALLY good sign that, homeowners took forbearance out of an abundance of caution\u2026they didn\u2019t need it\u2026and now they\u2019re in a good position to resume as usual. HOWEVER\u2026in an unexpected turn of events\u2026in these last 2 weeks, for the first time since April\u2026 the number of mortgages in forbearance actually started to tick back up. \n\nNow, a more TELLING sign would be if this trend CONTINUES for another few months, in which case - that\u2019s something to address\u2026.OR, if this is a result of new shutdowns, fewer people opting OUT of forbearance, or wanting to play it a little safer over the holidays. \n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell, but I\u2019ve still maintained the position that - overall - mortgage forbearances only make up a small portion of the housing market, it won\u2019t cause a wave of foreclosures, and even IF people are unable to pay - I have a strong feeling that banks will want to work with their clientele to AVOID foreclosing on them at all costs. So, I\u2019d venture to say that - even though, YES, it\u2019s unfortunate that these numbers are going up - it\u2019s too early to draw any meaningful conclusions. \n\nIf you\u2019re a buyer for homes right now, my best advice is to keep looking, don\u2019t get discouraged, and you MUST be quick to get a deal when you see the right home. I WOULD expect prices to come down at some point, ESPECIALLY once interest rates EVENTUALLY go back up\u2026but, that could be awhile, and until then, if you\u2019re looking for some place to buy and hold long term, over 10 years\u2026it\u2019s probably a better idea to spend the time finding the right place, locking in as low of a rate as you can possible get\u2026and then, do nothing. \n\nAs long as you can comfortably afford to make the payments, any fluctuations in price won\u2019t matter\u2026and from there, you can ride out anything that might happen.

Basically, the logic is that - if the market returns an AVERAGE of 7% per year adjusted for inflation, you\u2019re safe spending about 4% of that - while still having enough left over to grow and hold you through the times where the stock market goes down for a prolonged period of time. \n\nSo, using this logic\u2026if you wanted to replace the AVERAGE American income of $63,784\u2026you multiply THAT by 25\u2026.and that means you would need $1,619,600 invested in the stock market to FULLY replace the average income. \n\nThe SECOND APPROACH: DIVIDEND STOCKS\nHere\u2019s how that works: when you buy a stock, what you\u2019re REALLY buying into a small ownership share of that company. Now that you own a small piece of the company by investing in their stock - some of those companies will pay you out a \u201cdividend,\u201d which is a fancy word for saying: they\u2019re going to pay you a portion of their profits, because you own a small piece of their company by buying their stock. \n\nIn my opinion, DIVIDEND STOCKS CAN be a good replacement of your income\u2026but, I wouldn\u2019t create your entire portfolio from it, because it\u2019s MORE Important to look at the growth of the overall stock and the company, rather than JUST how much they pay. . \n\nAnd FINALLY\u2026the third approach, where you can speed up this process a LOT - is by investing in Real Estate. \nFor example, instead of investing $20,000 into buying stocks - you might be able to use $20,000 as a down payment to buy a $125,000 home that rents for $1000 per month. In this case, about $450 per month will pay your mortgage to the bank\u2026$50 per month would go to insurance\u2026$100 per month would to maintenance and repairs\u2026$100 per month would to go vacancy and miscellaneous\u2026and that would leave you with $300 PER MONTH left over as profit\u2026from a $20,000 investment. In that scenario, you\u2019re earning an 18% cash return on your $20,000. \n\nTo start doing this:\n\nFIRST: TRACK YOUR SPENDING. \nJust go to Mint.com or PersonalCapital.com, they\u2019re both free, sign up - and then watch your spending for the next 30-60 days to see EXACTLY how much you spend every month. That\u2019s all you need to do for this step. \n\nSECOND: CUT BACK WHAT YOU DON\u2019T NEED\nOnce you see how you spend your money over 30-60 days, you\u2019re going to be able to point out some inefficiencies with where you spend and what you don\u2019t need. \n\nTHIRD: SAVE AND INVEST THAT EXTRA MONEY\nLiterally WHATEVER YOU CUT BACK ON HERE - INVEST IT IMMEDIATELY. Open up a Roth IRA if you don\u2019t already have one, throw that money into a low cost index fund, save up for a down payment on real estate, or do SOMETHING with the intention of investing it. \n\nFOURTH: LOOK INTO GETTING ANOTHER JOB OR SWITCHING CAREERS\nThere are multiple studies that have shown that people who switch jobs every 2-3 years make nearly 50% more than someone who stays with the same company. \nhttps:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/cameronkeng\/2014\/06\/22\/employees-that-stay-in-companies-longer-than-2-years-get-paid-50-less\/#6b8e42c1e07f\n\nAND FIFTH: SLOWLY BUILD THIS UP OVER TIME WHILE YOU RE-INVEST YOUR PROFITS\n\nAnd the OTHER good news is that, the less money you SPEND - the less money you need to REPLACE - and not everyone needs $63,000 per year in passive income. \n\nAs far as my own thoughts on this, and what I would do\u2026honestly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s best to use a combination of ALL 3 OPTIONS if you want to invest enough to replace your income. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Well, ORDINARILY, if you were to sell that first stock for a $10,000 profit - you would have to pay taxes on that profit, which could be anywhere from 10-50%, depending on your tax bracket. BUT\u2026according to the IRS, you can OFFSET that profit by selling ANOTHER stock at a loss\u2026.and if you structure it correctly, that loss would ENTIRELY wipe out the tax you would pay on that gain. \n\nThis means that I would be in a STRONG position to sell ALL of my losing stock market positions by the end of the year, and then - I can use that \u201cLOSS\u201d to offset my profits on the stocks I sell for a GAIN. Now, ORDINARILY - I would hold off from selling stocks - but, in this case, there\u2019s ZERO downside not to sell a portion of my best performing stocks - and then, I can sell the losers to offset that loss so that I won\u2019t owe any short term capital gains tax on my profit. At the very least, I was able to raise my tax basis so that I\u2019ll owe less in the future - and, at the very most, I\u2019ve just made a \u201ctax free profit.\u201d\n\nThis is an INCREDIBLY common tax strategy that A LOT of investors utilize at the end of each year, and if YOU have losing positions that could potentially offset your profits - then it\u2019s WORTH IT to structure these in such a way to reduce your taxable gain. \n\nIN ADDITION TO THAT\u2026if your capital losses exceed your total profit\u2026meaning, you\u2019ve lost more than you\u2019ve made\u2026then, that remaining amount can be deducted off your earned income, up to $3000 per year, and any amount ABOVE that can be carried forward into future years. So, lets just say you browsed wallstreetbets\u2026went too heavy into GameStop\u2026and now, you have a $6000 loss. Well, even if you have NO OTHER investment profits\u2026you can reduce your taxable income by $3000 in the first year, and $3000 again the second year until your loss is completely deducted 100%. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026there are a few rules when it comes to this, and a few VERY important pitfalls you NEED to avoid if you do this correctly:\n\nThe most well known is what\u2019s called a \u201cWASH SALE.\u201d This is when you sell a stock for a loss, use that loss to offset your tax, and then IMMEDIATELY go in and buy the exact same stock YOU JUST SOLD within a 30-days window. The IRS does NOT allow that, because otherwise - EVERYONE would sell their losing stocks as soon as they could, and then just continually buy back in\u2026so, you can\u2019t do that. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026there\u2019s NOTHING that says you can\u2019t go and buy a DIFFERENT stock immediately after. \n\nThe SECOND rule is that the TYPE of stock loss will FIRST offset that same TYPE of stock profit\u2026I know that made no sense, but I was trying to think of ways to explain it\u2026so here\u2019s an example:\n\nIf you have a SHORT TERM LOSS On a stock you held for less than a year\u2026that \u201ctax deduction\u201d will FIRST be applied to all the PROFITS you made from stocks you held for less than a year\u2026.ad then, anything remaining will offset your LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS. \n\nAnd besides selling off the losers and then making sure I have an equivalent amount of profit to offset - everything else is relatively staying the exact same.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

They talk about world problems, issues we\u2019re facing, and social unjust\u2026and then, they work on solutions to fix whatever needs to be done. \n\nThis \u201cillness\u201d has fundamentally changed the way we go about our day to day lives, it\u2019s shifted demand towards nearly  everything becoming digitalized, it\u2019s halted the restaurant and hospitality industry, and the divide between the rich and poor has continued to grow further and further apart. \n\nThat caused a LARGE portion of our population to be \u201cleft out,\u201d suddenly lose their job, and then be unable to return back to work\u2026and it also caused OTHR people to grow their business to such extreme levels that never would\u2019ve been possible without a stay at home order in effect. So, instead of a gradual shift that allows people time to adapt and evolve\u2026this change was just thrown on us, and that\u2019s bound to create some social challenges. \n\nWell, the \u201cgreat reset\u201d is a term that calls for CHANGE to current rules and policies that would put PEOPLE FIRST, BUSINESS SECOND\u2026and a few of their priorities include placing a bigger focus on education, re-allocating government funding to more sustainable development and green energy, and placing restrictions on companies that take bailout money from the government. \nhttps:\/\/www.weforum.org\/agenda\/2020\/07\/klaus-schwab-nature-jobs-great-reset-podcast\/\n\nTheir thought is that - if we\u2019re going to be creating a trillion dollar stimulus - we may as well use that money to better our future and creating a more sustainable environment. We may as well use this as an opportunity to address all of our problems, and find a solution NOW rather than wait for them to get worse. \n\nI think the INTENTIONS are good\u2026but, besides saying that \u201cwe need to work together and provide solutions to problems\u201d the \u201cgreat reset\u201d turned into more like \u201cthe great confusion that\u2019s unlikely to ever happen.\u201d \n\nSo, instead of focusing ANY more time on the great reset\u2026here\u2019s \u201cThe Great Solution\u201d that I think we should all implement right now: \n\nFirst, learn to take initiative. \nIf there\u2019s something you want, you have the power to begin working towards it immediately. By watching this video, you already have access to the internet\u2026and nearly everything you need to know is at your fingertips between google and YouTube, pretty much for free. \n\nSecond, we should all place a stronger emphasis on financial education. \nI\u2019m really happy that it\u2019s finally becoming \u201ccool\u201d to save money, live below our means, and invest. \n\nThird, we each should learn how to work for ourselves\nUltimately, relying on someone else for a paycheck isn\u2019t always going to be sustainable\u2026so, learning how to take matters into your own hands, when necessary, is going to be a helpful skill that ANYONE could use. \n\nFourth, be compassionate and kind to others\nI know this one isn\u2019t financial related AT ALL\u2026but, it\u2019s just common courtesy. You have no idea what people are going through behind the scenes, or the struggles they face day to day\u2026so, be nice to everyone. \n\nFifth\u2026continually learn from our past experiences. \nYou would be SHOCKED at how many people don\u2019t learn from their mistakes, place the blame on someone else, and then continue making that same mistake because they\u2019re convinced they aren\u2019t doing anything wrong.  \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

A survey found that more than HALF of buyers felt like it was a good time to buy because of insanely low mortgage interest rates, so it\u2019s no surprise that\u2019s driving a BIG push for people to lock in a low rate while they still can. \n\nHOWEVER\u2026Not EVERYONE is so optimistic. \n\nThe economist, Michael Strain, mentions that, as of recently, 10% of the 8-million single family mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration were delinquent by more than three months\u2026.along with \u201cThese delinquencies are heavily concentrated among loans associated with low credit scores.\u201d\u00a0\n\nHe then says that this is cause for concern, because the ONLY REASON we\u2019re NOT seeing a \u201cWave of foreclosures\u201d is because of a provision in the cares act that temporarily freezes foreclosures until 2021. \n\nWell, through September of 2018\u2026the rate of seriously diligent loans was about 3.7%\u2026and, at any given point in time, historically, 8-9% of FHA are behind on their payments by 30 days or more\u2026so, YES, FHA loans more than 90 days late ARE more than DOUBLE what they were just 2 years ago\u2026but, given that - most of the time, almost 4% are consistently more than 90 days late..it\u2019s not AS BAD as we expected.\n\nThe data company Black Knight found that 2.75 million mortgages, or 5.2% of all residential properties with a mortgage, were in active forbearance as of Dec. 8. \n\nBut, here\u2019s a more broad perspective when it comes to this:\n\nThere are 138 million total housing units in the United States - this includes single family, condos, multi-family, and apartment buildings\u2026and of those, 40% are completely owned outright with no mortgage. \n\nThen - of those properties with a mortgage, which is estimated to be approximately 50 million properties\u2026the mortgage bankers association found that that 5.83% are in a forbearance plan, which they say impacts 2.9 million households. \n\nIn order for a home to be foreclosed, it needs to be taken over by the bank - and the seller must GENERALLY owe more on the home than what it\u2019s worth, otherwise - the seller would just sell the home on the market to avoid foreclosure. Well, the data company CoreLogic found that only 3% of all mortgaged properties are underwater, which is an ALL TIME LOW.\n\nSo, if we assume that ALL 3% of those underwater homes go into foreclosure from those 5.83% of loans in forbearance\u2026that means only 0.1749% of mortgaged properties would be foreclosed on\u2026or, 96,000 total homes. \n\nSo, OVERALL\u2026based on the numbers and evidence presented to us\u2026no, a wave of foreclosures is HIGHLY UNLIKELY of ever happening that would \u201cCrash\u201d the real estate market.\n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Those firms usually earn a very, very small percentage off the total amount\u2026and even though this is a very common practice for almost every brokerage - the $65 million dollar settlement came from accusations that Robinhood didn\u2019t necessarily get customers the most competitive pricing on the stock - but, instead - the routed orders to the company that paid the highest commission to Robinhood. \n\nSecond, the most recent allegation against Robinhood\u2026is this:\n\u201cRobinhood accused of targeting novice investors with features that encourage excessive trading\u201d\nhttps:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/robinhood-lawsuit-massachusetts-aggressive-marketing-novice-investors\/\n\nREAD THE MASSACHUSETTS LAWSUIT HERE\nhttps:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1IwkWVLlFtlCBX-z3N_k-GrZx2ZCQ-g8c\/view\nThey claim that Robinhood is using aggressive tactics to target inexperienced investors, they\u2019re failing to responsibly prevent and respond to system outages, they\u2019re gamifying investing to encourage repetitive trading, they aren\u2019t supervising who\u2019s trading options, and because of that, they have breached their fiduciary duty as a brokerage. \n\nNow, obviously - this is a REALLY touchy subject, because - on the one hand, investing SHOULD be made accessible to everyone - but, on the other hand, there ARE safeguards that should in place from preventing someone from getting in over their head.\n\nObviously, some might argue that it\u2019s not ANY brokerages responsibility to protect people from themselves\u2026but, the REAL issue is whether or not Robinhood has a legal obligation to put safeguards in place to make sure people can\u2019t get carried away,  and make sure that they properly qualify everyone as outlined by law. \n\nBUT, I do have to end this off on a positive note for Robinhood, that - without them - we likely wouldn\u2019t be seeing $0 stock trades like we do now, and UNDOUBTABLY, they\u2019ve opened the door for SO MANY NEW PEOPLE TO INVEST that never would\u2019ve invested otherwise. There\u2019s inevitably going to be growing pains throughout the process, especially when you\u2019re scaling up a \u201cnew\u201d company to a now estimated $20 BILLION dollar valuation\u2026and, overall, there\u2019s a LOT of GOOD to come out of the platform, as well. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

OR - OPENING UP ANOTHER CREDIT CARD or increasing your credit limit will solve that problem. \n\nTHREE: TRY EXPERIAN BOOST.\nExperian Boost is a totally free service that links to your accounts, and then tracks on-time phone and utility payments by adding them as a positive trade-in to your Experian credit file. Doing this will give you: more positive credit history and more on-time payments to help boost up your score. \n\nFOUR: LATE PAYMENTS on your account! \nIt\u2019s always worth it to TRY to negotiate the terms of the debt and see if they can adjust your account status back to current. This means you can reach out to the lender and, if you\u2019re having a difficult time making payments, see if you can work out a payment plan. Or, work some type of installment loan in exchange for bringing the account current and making a payment.\n\nFIFTH: DON\u2019T CLOSE OUT ANY ACCOUNTS. \nBecause your credit score is calculated by the AVERAGE AGE of your credit history - that STARTS FROM from the age of your oldest account. BUT, IF YOU CLOSE that oldest account because \u201cyou don\u2019t use that card anymore\u201d - what you\u2019re really doing is ERASING your oldest trade line, and when that happens - eventually, the average length of your credit history will drop - and when that happens, it\u2019ll look as though you have a much newer account then you actually do, and that will lower your score. \n\nDON\u2019T CLOSE OUT ANY CREDIT CARDS, EVEN IF YOU DON\u2019T USE THEM. \n\nBy doing this, and raising your score above 750 or so, you\u2019ll get the lowest interest rates imaginable, you\u2019ll be able to take advantage of credit card sign up offers, you\u2019ll get a whole bunch of free stuff, and this just opens up SO many opportunities that SAVE YOU MONEY that just wouldn\u2019t be possible without a good score. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Typically, this would bode REALLY well for a real estate investor like myself....\n\nBut, SECOND\u2026that comes at a cost. Because interest rates have become so inexpensive, it\u2019s driven up the price of real estate because - now - people can afford to spend just a little more than before, and there\u2019s more demand to lock in a mortgage. \n\nThird, speaking of demand - there\u2019s a LOT of it. So much so, that it\u2019s caused inventory to drop to its all time lowest level\u2026also, in history. \n\nThat means, fourth - when you combine low interest rates, with low inventory, with high demand\u2026you get a market that\u2019s EXTREMELY difficult to find the type of deals that I\u2019m looking to buy. \n\nWHY I'M NOT BUYING REAL ESTATE: \nFor the last 10 years, I\u2019ve invested nearly EVERYTHING I save into Real Estate, and for the longest time - that made up almost the ENTIRELY of my investment portfolio. \n\nEven though it was VERY PROFITABLE\u2026it\u2019s NOT SMART to hold 90% of your net worth in real estate, in one city. It\u2019s just too big of a risk that something COULD happen, without at least having SOMETHING ELSE to hedge that position. Something like this never really clicked when I was younger, because I was all about going after whatever made the most money\u2026but, at a certain point, it becomes more important to PRESERVE your wealth, then CONTINUE growing it as fast as possible\u2026and by diversifying AWAY from Real Estate, it\u2019s given me a LOT more peace of mind that - no matter what happens - I\u2019ll be good.\n\nNext, another recent revelation that I\u2019ve come to understand over the last year - is that value of my time. I\u2019ve gotten to a point where I don\u2019t have enough time in the day to get everything done. Even something like \u201chopping on a 30 minute call\u201d has turned into a \u201cI need o schedule this a few days in advance\u201d because otherwise, everything else is booked up and I have to pull away from something else just to make the time. If I didn\u2019t prioritize EVERYTHING this way, NOTHING would get done, and things would fall through the cracks\u2026so, I now have a value for my time, and I ration it very precisely. \n\nBecause of that, I\u2019m not able to spend the time I used to to be able to find the right deal, and manage the work myself. \n\nFor me, and - I think for MOST people - Real Estate is a PHENOMENAL TOOL for wealth CREATION. There\u2019s no other investment that offers the opportunity to potentially DOUBLE your money, YEAR AFTER YEAR, through sourcing the right deals, fixing them up, and renting them out.  \n\nHowever, at a certain point - I need to take a step back, and realize that I\u2019ve been TOO oriented around real estate, from a diversification standpoint, and it MAKES SENSE to take a more hands off, passive approach so that I have more time to focus on other endeavors. \n\nMy investments right now are all about lower risk, lower return, more diversification, and a safer allocation that allows it to continue to grow - but, at a slower, more consistent rate. It\u2019s less stress, less work, less for me to think about, the more I can streamline my entire life - the better I can work on other things. . \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

In order to actually GET the benefit - it\u2019s going to be dispersed through your STATE, and then YOUR STATE will be the ones to allocate the money as needed. \n\n- $600 STIMULUS CHECKS\nIn order to qualify for the $600 stimulus check - you must make under $75,000 if you\u2019re single, or $150,000 if you\u2019re married\u2026and your total benefit is reduced by $5 for every $100 you make above that threshold. That means, if you make above $87,000 as a single person, or $174,000 as a married couple - you won\u2019t get anything. \n\nThey\u2019re going to be basing this on your 2019 tax return\u2026and if you saw a reduction of income in 2020, you\u2019ll get this amount back when you file THIS YEARS tax return. In addition to that, you\u2019ll receive an ADDITIONAL $600 for each qualifying dependent UNDER the age of 17. \n\n-$325 BILLION FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND PPP FUNDING\nFor those that aren\u2019t aware, the paycheck protection program is aimed at businesses - who are able to take out a low interest loan to help keep themselves afloat, and keep their employees on payroll. There are also certain provisions that say, if the money is spent on qualifying expenses - then the ENTIRE amount can be completely forgiven, meaning, they don\u2019t have to pay it back\u2026meaning, it\u2019s basically free money for businesses. \n\n-$82 BILLION ALLOCATED FOR SCHOOLS\n-$69 BILLION FOR TESTING, HEALTH PROVIDERS, ETC\n-$45 BILLION FOR TRANSPORTATION \n-$26 BILLION FOR FOOD STAMPS, FARMERS, RANCHERS\n-$15 Billion FOR LIVE EVENT VENUES\n-$10 BILLION CHILDCARE ASSISTANCE\n-$10 BILLION FUNDING FOR POSTAL SERVICE\n\nBeyond that, we have: \n\n-A BAN ON MOST SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS\nThis is a VERY common practice in hospitals, and a VERY common tactic for insurance companies who refuse to pay for your services\u2026so, now - thanks to this package - insurance companies will have to negotiate for those \u201cout of network\u201d costs beginning in 2022. \n\n-$35 BILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS GREEN ENERGY AND RESEARCH\nThis is a BIG win for all you clean energy stock holders, who have all seen quite a big jump today in their share prices\n\n-100% BUSINESS MEAL DEDUCTIONS \n The goal is that this is going to encourage more business people to eat out, helping the restaurant industry - because now, it\u2019s a 100% write off. \n\n-PAYROLL TAX CAN BE PAID BACK AT END OF 2021\nThis won\u2019t impact everyone, but if you had your payroll taxes deferred as both an employee or EMPLOYER\u2026you now have until the end of 2021 to pay that back.\n\nEven though this one isn\u2019t as big as people had expected a few months ago, the \u201cthinking\u201d is that - most likely, there will be ANOTHER stimulus package in the future, and THAT will be more all-encompassing. This one is meant to keep us going just a little longer until vaccines start rolling out and things start getting back to normal, and then we can move forward with something else depending on what happens. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

A VALUE STOCK is a company that is believed to be trading BELOW what it's actually worth, and because of that - they it has the POTENTIAL to bring YOU better returns.\n\nAccording to many articles, we\u2019re in a new time where money might begin shifting AWAY from TECH\u2026and into THE VALUE RECOVERY sectors, as investors try to capitalize on the re-opening of our economy. \n\nA Bank of America Analyst predicted that we\u2019re at the early inning of an upcoming \u201cvalue cycle\u201d, and that the relative discount for Value stocks remains nearly two standard deviations below average. \nhttps:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/stock-market-outlook-value-rally-bofa-sp500-tepid-returns-2021-2020-12-1029878604\n\nGoldman Sachs also agreed with this, saying that the market is due for a large but temporary rotation out of growth stocks. \nhttps:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/stock-market-outlook-rotation-growth-value-temporary-goldman-sachs-forecast-2020-10-1029685107\n\nMarketwatch covered another analysts, who said that the market rally - up to THIS point - has been supported by companies which are more RESILIENT to socially-distant uncertainty\u2026.like, Zoom. But, a future rally is likely to include a combination of both recovery and E-COMMERCE, and future gains are likely going to be more balanced. \nhttps:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/is-the-great-rotation-in-the-stock-market-under-way-as-coronavirus-cases-surge-or-is-it-a-false-dawn-heres-what-experts-think-2020-07-18\n\nAnd finally, JP Morgan also repeated the same thing for 2021, saying that value stocks are poised to outperform once the global economy fully re-emerges. \nhttps:\/\/markets.businessinsider.com\/news\/stocks\/stock-market-value-rotation-previews-2021-action-strategy-outlook-jpmorgan-2020-11-1029798647\u00a0\n\nThe RISK, however\u2026is that things like this are NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE to time. We don\u2019t know how much is already \u201cpriced in\u201d to the market, we don\u2019t know how much demand there will be, or how long investors will sit on the sidelines to wait it out and see what happens. We also don\u2019t know if tech will just CONTINUE leading the way. \n\nSo, in terms of my overall recommendation here\u2026I\u2019m not just going to tell you to \u201cBUY THE INDEX FUND AND HODL!\u201d Because that\u2019s what I say every time\u2026I want to make this more interesting, and really leave the choice to you\u2026so here\u2019s what I have to say: \n\nFirst, if you want to go and buy hard hit recovery stocks in the restaurant, airline, energy, oil, or travel sector\u2026it\u2019s high risk high reward. JUST BECAUSE something is trading below its value LAST YEAR, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s automatically going to return to that same price, or that THAT is how much it\u2019s worth. \n\nSecond, for LESS risk\u2026you can invest in the broader markets through an index fund or ETF. The Russel 1000 follows the top 1000 companies in the United States, and tends to skew more towards large cap stocks - this would weight your investments slightly differently from the SP500, although not enough to miss out entirely if big tech keeps doing well. \n\nAnd THIRD\u2026you COULD just keep doing what you\u2019re normally doing, and stay invested in the SP500 and let the leaders continue to lead. There\u2019s been talks about the concern of the index being weighted too heavily on a few really large companies\u2026and there\u2019s certainly risk to that\u2026but, you also risk missing out on that growth in the event they continue to do well. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

TRACK YOUR SPENDING. \nI have to say, if there\u2019s just ONE point throughout this ENTIRE video that you chose to follow\u2026let it be this one, because I guarantee\u2026this will have the biggest impact on the rest of your life if you just stick with it. Sign up for a budget tracking software like Mint.com or PersonalCapital.com, which are both completely free to use\u2026and then, pay CLOSE attention to how much money you\u2019re making, and how much you\u2019re spending. I want you to SEE how much you spend on things you don\u2019t even realize, or how quickly those small expenditures add up over the week and month. \n\n2. ONLY BUY THE ESSENTIALS \nI challenge you to start getting in the habit of CAREFULLY considering everything you want, and ONLY buying something when you can afford it outright, after thinking it through, and once you\u2019ve prioritized your other investing and savings goals. We\u2019ve all heard the saying: don\u2019t put the cart before the horse\u2026and this applies here, just like you shouldn\u2019t put the brand new car ahead of your emergency fund. \n\n3. MAKE YOUR MONEY INVISIBLE\nAs soon as YOU get paid, or as soon as money goes into your account -  IMMEDIATELY move it into investments, put it in a savings account you don\u2019t touch, that way it's out of sight, and out of mind. You get the immediate \u201cReward\u201d of saving - and that makes you feel like you\u2019re working towards something tangible, because you can \u201cSee\u201d that savings right in front of you. Two, you\u2019re FORCED to live off less because your invested money is completely out of reach. And three, you get USED to living on less - and you get USED to saving more - that you won\u2019t WANT to break this habit once you see it working. \n\n4. DON'T INVEST IN ANYTHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND\nThe people who are GOOD with money don\u2019t just PANIC FOMO into investments because \u201cpretty soon it\u2019ll be too late to get in\u201d - the truth is that, there will ALWAYS be new opportunities in the future that will be just as profitable as some of the best ones today, and there will never just be one SINGLE thing that you could strike rich at. \n\n5. DO NOT TIME THE MARKET. \nI\u2019ve seen this type of pattern over and over and over again, and what I\u2019ve noticed is that - the type of person who waits for a drop, is the same time of person who refuses to buy in when there ACTUALLY is a drop. It\u2019s like, they\u2019re always waiting for it to go lower - and even if it goes lower, they hold out for it to go EVEN lower\u2026and once it starts going up, then it\u2019s always going to be too expensive. \n\n6. UNDERSTAND HOW TAXES WORK\nThis is the step that I would recommend fully immersing yourself in once you have the groundwork finished with everything else\u2026so, once you\u2019re tracking your spending, once you cut back on wants, once you make your money invisible, once you invest in things you understand, and once you\u2019re not timing the market\u2026THEN, really learn the tax code and make the most of the money you have left over. \n\nAnd, finally\u2026that little cherry to top all of this off\u2026is just CONSISTENCY. Not only do you actually have to work on everything I just talked about\u2026but, you also have you keep doing it, day after day, in order for it to work. Shortcuts rarely ever last, and more often than not - if you look for the quick and easy fix, you\u2019re soon back to where you originally started, except now - you\u2019re further behind where you could\u2019ve been, had you just followed the right path from the very beginning. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

This is money in checking accounts that could basically be converted to cash, or spent, at a moments notice. \n\nAfter that, we have M2\u2026this includes money sitting in savings accounts, money market funds, and other accounts that people hold on to with less than $100,000, but don\u2019t use for day-to-day spending. This ALSO includes all of M1\n\nAnd finally, we have M3\u2026this covers investment accounts, retirement accounts, and other \u201clong term holdings\u201d that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily spend instantly, but - you COULD get access to money if you needed to. And just like the others, M2 also includes all of M2.  \n\nFirst, there was a big shift of money moved from Savings Accounts and into Cash and Checking Accounts\u2026or, to put it more appropriately\u2026there was a big influx of M2 money supply moving into M1, where it could be more easily spent. The thinking is that this is AROUND the time where many mortgage forbearance plans were expiring, we weren\u2019t sure if rental protections would be extended beyond December 31st, and end of year financial obligations may have caused a big move into the M1 Money Supply. \n\nSecond, this MIGHT have something to do with proposed tax plans on long term capital gains for those earning over $1 million per year. There have been quite a few proposals for an increase in tax rates and transfers, and because of that - many wealthy people have shown interest in locking in their profits, or cashing out by the end of the year to avoid a potentially HIGHER tax in the future. \n\nThird, as people save more money and refuse to spend it - more money is going to end up in savings and cash, further inflating this amount you see here. \n\nOr, in other words - OVERALL, YES - more money was introduced through the Trillion Dollar Cares Act, people had to save because there were fewer places to spend their money, low interest rates promoted more borrowing so people could have access to more money, the velocity of money dropped because that money wasn\u2019t spent, and because of that - there was a large influx of money into SAVINGS AND CHECKING ACCOUNTS than we\u2019ve seen during any other time in history. That\u2019s why the money supply saw a HUGE initial increase. \n\nRegardless, though - YES\u2026a LOT of more money IS in circulation\u2026a LOT of that was because people have fewer places to spend it, so they keep it in their accounts\u2026and, until there\u2019s sufficient demand - there\u2019s not much concern for inflation. In the future, that might be a different story as stock and real estate prices continue to go up\u2026but, at least now you know more about it, and how the supply of money affects you and your wallet. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Well, even though the stock market has so far peaked at its recent all time high - according to history, that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t go even higher, and when we compare ourselves to the 2001 tech bubble - we\u2019re still much more \u201creasonably\u201d priced.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand this because, the more we know about the markets, the more comfortable we should feel to invest, and the less likely we are to panic when the market drops 1% and people post comments on reddit asking if they should sell everything.\n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make with this video is just this: you can ALWAYS find reasons to believe what you think the market will do. If you think it\u2019s over valued, there are certainly indicators that you could find to prove that correct\u2026or, if you think it\u2019s undervalued, there are certainly OTHER indicators you could find to prove THAT correct. It\u2019s just like the thinking: higher corporate taxes will lower stock prices, but higher stimulus will boost stock prices\u2026either way, the market is what it is, and things tend to rise over time. \n\nSo, sure - maybe we COULD see prices coming down, but - we could also continue to see prices continuing to go up, ESPECIALLY in areas that are starting to get more attention, like in Green Energy. But, if I have any piece of advice when it comes to this - it\u2019s just this: \n\nKeep a 3-6 month safety fund at all times, and just keep investing. I realize it\u2019s difficult to plow money into the SP500 when it\u2019s at an all time high, or worrying that maybe things are downhill from here - but, over the long term, the price you pay today isn\u2019t going to make a massive difference. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Housing\nIt's important to live below our mans, reduce what isn't necessary, and don't overextend ourselves in terms of where we live. This can be reduced by renting out unused space, buying a property with a guest or rental unit, and investing in real estate long term to offset the monthly cost. \n\n2. Transportation \nMy recommendation is just this: UNLESS you need a \u201cnice\u201d car for professional use\u2026go and get the most affordable, reliable, good on gas used car you can - and then drive it until it doesn\u2019t run anymore. \n\n3. Taxes\nOne of the BEST ways to cut down on your tax bill, AND invest at the same time - is to make sure you\u2019re taking advantage of your Employer 401K. This is a tax-advantaged retirement account that allows you to contribute up to $19,500 per year of PRE-TAX money, meaning - every $1 you contribute to a 401k will reduce your taxable income by that very same $1, so that way - you owe less in tax, and have more money left over to invest.  \n\n4. Dining Out \/ Restaurants\nIF you\u2019re dining out, or going to a restaurant, or getting food delivery - AVOID doing that out of laziness. BUT, if you\u2019re idea of a good time is going out and ordering a nice meal once a week with friends and family - THEN, sure - I think that\u2019s a worthwhile experience. \n\n5. Insurance \nI think you would be surprised how much you could save with an hour of work, calling around, and comparing personal insurance rates!\n\n6. Debt Repayment \/ Credit Cards\nTake the approach of cutting back as much as you can, in every possible area - and throwing ALL of that money at the debt with the highest interest rate above 5%. \n\n7. Clothing \/ Apparel \nPeople are spending, on average, $133 per month on apparel - if this is you, go and take a look at your closet, and notice how many clothes you REALLY end up wearing on a regular basis. Stop shopping, or cut down your clothing budget by HALF. That would equate to another $65 per month of savings. \n\n8. Other \nEven though this is only $64 per month according to the study\u2026.unless there\u2019s some sort of unknown benefit to you here\u2026chances are, this is entirely a waste. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Wealthfront Advisers LLC (\u201cWealthfront Advisers\u201d) and Graham Stephan have an agreement in place to promote Wealthfront products and services.

Two, there\u2019s a massive shortage of inventory. And third, they simply just can\u2019t build enough homes to satisfy demand. \n\nI would EXPECT to see more inventory coming on the market in 2021, but - as long as interest rates remain low - real estate prices should continue to hold fairly well. I believe the BIGGEST risk to real estate, RIGHT NOW - is interest rates. When the FED does EVENTUALLY raise rates, it\u2019s going to squeeze affordability on buyers - and prices might subsequently begin coming down. \n\nFor those of those of you who DO want to invest this year, here\u2019s my advice: \n-Wait for the right deal.  \n-ONLY buy if you\u2019re planning to hold the property for at least 5-8 years. \n-The VALUE of your home should come SECOND to CASHFLOW. \n\nSTOCK MARKET INVESTING FOR BEGINNERS: \nI\u2019m going to quote something super cheesy that people hate hearing, but it\u2019s the truth: \u201cThe stock market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\u201d In other words, that means: the stock market can, and always will, outlast whatever you think it will do. \n\nSo, given that\u2026as long as you have an investment timeframe of longer than 10 years\u2026the best thing you can do is just ignore the noise and keep investing. My plan this year is to invest about 85% of my money in an SP500 index fund and that\u2019s it.\n\nThe other 15% of my stock-market money will likely be invested in individual stocks that I believe in long term. Lately, I\u2019ve invested smaller amounts in solar and other green energy companies, because not only do they help a cause that I believe in - but, I think they\u2019ll do really well as more people embrace renewable energies. \n\nSo, overall\u2026practically, here\u2019s my investing plan for 2021 and exactly what I\u2019m doing with my money, with some takeaways that will also apply to you:\n\nFirst, I\u2019m keeping a large cash reserve JUST IN CASE anything happens. \nTo me, this is my peace-of-mind to sleep well at night knowing that, IF anything were to happen - I\u2019d have enough to fall back on to be okay. \n\nSecond, I\u2019m re-investing about 85% of my left over money BACK into the stock market. \nI\u2019m doing this just by consistently dollar-cost-averaging into the markets, and that\u2019s it. \n\nThird, the other 15% is investing in the \u201cother category\u201d \nThis includes individual stocks, startup ventures, starting other businesses, or - a very, very tiny 1% portion in bitcoin \/ ethereum. \n\nFourth, if I use the cash position - it would be for an unbelievable opportunity. \nThis might mean buying real estate, it might mean an angel investment, it could be buying more stocks - I\u2019m leaving this one up to opportunity,\n\nAnd most importantly - DON\u2019T SELL, even if we see things go down. The best thing you can do is stay the course, keep to the plan, stay consistent, and keep buying. Study after study have shown that those who hold their investments and keep buying, long term, end up making the most money...as long as you smash the like button. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

But, as the overall video-game market began outgrowing the store, and more and more people shifted towards online downloads versus shopping in outdated malls with nothing left. \n\nIn June of 2020, GameStop announced that they saw a 519% jump in online sales when they were forced to shut down their physical locations. \n\nIn August of 2020, The Billionaire Co-Founder of Chewy.com, announces that he bought a 9% stake in the company, and plans to turn it into an Amazon Rival through his active involvement and re-management of the company. \n\nAfter that, they announced a multi-year strategic partnership with Microsoft, with plans to expand both their physical store - AND, their digital store. \n\nSure enough, digital sales increased - and the Chewy.com co-founder increased his stake in GameStop to now 13%. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when, about 4 months ago\u2026users on WallStreetBets discovered a little-known secret of the stock that would cause it to skyrocket exponentially, just given the right conditions\u2026.and, sure enough, he was right, and EVERYTHING he said 4 months ago is coming true\u2026 \n\nHe explained that GameStop was one of the most SHORTED stocks on the market, with almost 90% of stockholders betting the price will GO DOWN. In fact, it was SO SHORTED, that MORE SHARES WERE SHORTED than actually exist in the market for sale\u2026so, that\u2019s turning out to be the perfect storm to cause this price to SKYROCKET as soon as there\u2019s ANY GOOD news.\n\nThis user theorized that - because SO many people were short on GameStop - EVENTUALLY, all this good news is going to cause those short sellers to EXIT their positions, causing them to BUY BACK those shares at higher prices, and when that happens - the price of the stock goes up, and when THAT happens - MORE people close out their positions by buying back shares at a higher price - and that continues until the price of GameStop goes to the moon.\n\nNow, as for where this goes from here\u2026it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. At this point, it has NOTHING to do with the fundamentals of the company AT ALL\u2026BUT, it has to do with a unique situation of a limited quantity of shares available, combined with short seller interest, combined with WallStreetBets, which causes more people to pile in\u2026and it\u2019s a perfect storm, when those people refuse to sell what they\u2019ve just bought. \n\nThis is probably one of the riskiest, most speculative bets I\u2019ve ever talked about here on the channel\u2026so, as my word of caution here: DON\u2019T DO IT. \n\nMore importantly, though - this DOES represent a BIG SHIFT of power away from large, corporate institutional investors\u2026and into the hands of retail traders, or groups like WallStreetBets. I honestly think the power of retail traders have been GROSSLY underestimated for quite some time, and THIS is a good example that WallStreetBets should NOT be taken lightly.

AND\u2026they ended it by saying \u201cTo be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.\u201d\n\nNow, to be fair to Robinhood - this DID happen to other platforms, as well, who happen to use APEX Clearing to process their trades, and several brokerages, including TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, placed heavy restrictions on the stock by increasing their margin requirements \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m trying to be as neutral as possible when it comes to this, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to just point your finger at Robinhood, when there\u2019s a LOT more to the situation than most of us realize\u2026but, it\u2019s certainly going to require more research to get to the bottom of exactly what\u2019s going on. \n\nBut\u2026the way I see it, this event will ALMOST CERTAINLY cause there to be further regulation to prevent something like this from happening again. \n\nFor business or one-on-one real estate investing\/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com\n\n*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.

Unlearn: An Entrepreneur's Journey from Iranian Revolution to American Dream\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nOfficial HD Movie\n\nPatrick Bet-David presents a short film about the American Dream.  From a young age, all of us are taught a defining picture of what makes a successful life. We are told by our parents, our teachers and the media that if we follow the rules, excel in school and get a job, we will find happiness and success. But why is it that many hard working individuals never really find that success? Why do so many people get left behind despite following the rules and doing what they're told?\n\nSometimes we must UNLEARN some of the \"truths\" we've been taught in life in order to alter the status quo of our lives.

For as long as I can remember, I've had a passion for great movies. I remember as a kid in Iran watching movies from \"He-Man\" to \"Rocky\" and even \"Love Story\" over and over again.  \n\nMy wife and I have a tradition of going to the movies on Friday nights and this last Friday we watched \"Far from the Madding Crowd\".  It's a novel written by Thomas Hardy in 1874, about Gabriel Oak who's a great Shepherd that ends up losing all his fortune. Prior to losing his fortune, he falls in Love with Bathsheba Everdene, a very proud young beauty that ends up inheriting a great amount of wealth. What makes it even more painful is that he asks Bathsheba to marry him and she proudly says NO.  The story gets even better when two other men ask to marry her, one a wealthy man and the other a soldier.  I won't ruin the story for you.\n\nThere were many great lessons in the movie but one key point stuck with me.  Her pride and ego almost ended up costing her everything.  She couldn't use the 4 letter word that could've freed her from everything and that simple word was HELP.  HELP is by far one of the most difficult words to use because to many of us it means that we're not good enough to do something on our own. We confuse being independent with not needing help.  Some of us have a hard time committing to someone because we don't want our partner to know that we need them or we need any kind of help from them. This affects many relationships.  Many amateur and proud entrepreneurs don't make it in business because they have a hard time asking for help.  Many proud siblings have a hard time asking their brother or sister for help.\n\n\nThe kind of help I'm talking about is asking someone that's ahead of you or knows more about a subject than you to help you speed up the learning curve.  I'm not talking about asking someone for money although if you're running a business that may be the case at times when you're trying to raise capital.  \n\nThe point is, don't let your ego and pride of not knowing everything get in the way of not asking for HELP. You don't know everything and you're not great at everything, and that's OK.  Just be sure to say \"Thank you\" when someone does agree to helping you.  \n\nTweet me or send me a message if you do decide to watch \"Far from the Madding Crowd\".  I'm curious to know what you get out of the movie.\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/","publishedAt":"2015-05-18T16:57:54Z","tags":["Far From The Madding Crowd (Book)","Far From The Madding Crowd (Film)","I need your help","how to build an empire","patrick betdavid","assyrian entrepreneur","www.patrickbetdavid.com","startup entrepreneur","whystartup"],"title":"Most common phrase used by entrepreneurs who build an empire","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i3EVvqHMPbI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i3EVvqHMPbI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i3EVvqHMPbI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/i3EVvqHMPbI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"18","dislikeCount":"2","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"297","viewCount":"5461"}},{"id":"SAvJj2vrA6k","snippet":{"description":"You only get 24 hours and that 24 hours,  makes all the difference.

The process of going from being an under achiever to over achiever is extremely painful, challenging, and annoying but the final product is priceless.\n\nHere are 10 reasons why you should never give up.\n\n1.        It\u2019s easy to find a reason to quit.\n\nNo matter how good or bad your life is going, you can always find an excuse to give up. But it works the other way too.  If you look for a reason to keep going, you can find that too.\n\nSolution: There are 3 people we go to during tough times. Click here to find out the 3 types of people.  \n\n2.        When you quit, you send the message that you never thought you could do it in the first place.\nActions speak louder than words. In the end no matter what they hear you say, people will watch what you do.\n\n3.        Believe it or not, some people will be glad that you quit.\nThey may not say it, but unfortunately many people you know will hope for you to give up. This is for the simple reason that your dedication to your goal will remind them of their own unrealized potential. Rather than proving your doubters right, let your dedication inspire.\n\nSolution:  Here\u2019s a video about the haters in your life.  \n\n4.     You\u2019ll never know what would have happened if you stuck it out.\nYou know what happens if you give up \u2014 you end up right where you started. The hard part is having the vision to see the reward that lies at the end of the race.\n\n5.     The consequences of quitting are a lot higher than sticking it out.\nNo matter how high a price you\u2019ll pay to keep going, the price of abandoning your dreams carries the greater cost.\n\n6.     When you quit, you set a mental precedent to quit again.\nThink about a person who has tried to diet and failed several times. Their belief in their ability to lose weight is actually diminished by each abondoned attempt. Quitting and perseverance are both habit forming. Which habit do you want to develop?\n\nSolution:  Read this article from business insider on the 11 ways rich people think differently than average people.  \n\n7.     Anything worthwhile takes time, sacrifice, and effort.\nThe more difficult the challenge, the more rewarding the victory. The most meaningful accomplishments in life are those that don\u2019t come quickly or easily.\n\nSolution:  Watch the life of an entrepreneur in 90 seconds.  \n\n8.    You\u2019re a lot closer than you think you are.\nSadly, many people give up not realizing that success is right around the corner. There are not always clear markers in achieving a difficult goal.  The finish line could be just around the next bend.\n\n9.     The process shapes you before success rewards you.\nSetting difficult goals will stretch you, teach you perseverance and ultimately build your belief in yourself. It is the process that develops you. Greatness doesn\u2019t come overnight, but it is forged by every inch of progress we fight for in pursuit of a worthwhile goal.\n\n10.   Life is a lot more fun when you\u2019re in the hunt for something.\nWe only get one life to live. When you\u2019re fighting for a cause, a dream, or something greater than yourself you will find the enthusiasm, passion and joy that makes life a great adventure. The key is identifying your cause.  Read 25 laws for doing the impossible to identify your cause.

These are two words that are searched on Google regularly. One word is \"money.\" The other word is \"happy.\" Which of these two words do you think is searched more on Google, money, or happy?

Why are there so many bitter people who are unable to enjoy themselves?\n\nSo today, I want to explain this in a way that makes sense to you, and I'll promise you one thing.

When that happens, the fire inside you turns off, and when it comes to creation, everything is wiped out.\n\nI wanted to talk about this today because if you think about and study entrepreneurs, regardless of their age, the best entrepreneurs are childlike.

Michael Jordan WANTED Adidas but they FUMBLED the opportunity.\n\nConverse: The king of basketball was about to fall off the throne.  They had Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Dr. J \u2013 but they were slipping and not innovating at a time when fashion was coming to athletic shoes.  They were CONTENT to offer Michael Jordan the standard NBA player deal \u2013 but he wanted to see innovation and fresh ideas.\n\nNike: The leader in running shoes had recently told Wall Street that it had a financial loss.  Worse, the 1984 Olympics saw Carl Lewis will gold medals in flashy Nikes but that didn\u2019t translate to sales.  They NEEDED Michael Jordan and they knew it.  The incredible part is that Michael Jordan didn\u2019t even want to go to the Nike meeting \u2013 his parents were talked into it by his agent!\n\nGrab your notebook, take notes and join the conversation as Valuetainment brings you case studies with The Biz Doc.  \n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nPlease subscribe to Valuetainment, comment and share to help educate entrepreneurs from all over the world.\n\nSubscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\n\nAbout Tom Ellsworth: THOMAS N.

She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset!

She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there.

Subscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nWho is Kelly Nishimoto: \nhttp:\/\/www.kellynishimoto.com\/\n\nKelly Nishimoto was born in the back woods of Macon, Georgia to a Scottish Irish craftsman\/chemist\/musician father and a Japanese American jewelry designer mother. She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there. Kelly Nishimoto debuted her Spring\/Summer 2006 collection at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in March 2006. Feeling that fashion had no soul...she set out to make a full collection of things that were missing from her own closet. Simple elegance is how she described the flowing collection that graced the runway. Her Fall\/Winter\/Holiday 2006 collection was a perfect balance of her heritage...Scottish plaids and Japanese printed silks. Fresh off the runway is her Spring\/Summer 2007 collection she describes as women in the bedroom.\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nValuetainment- The best channel for entrepreneurs.","publishedAt":"2017-04-15T13:59:09Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","Kelly Nishimoto","cute booty lounge","how to brand","branding tips","how to brand yourself","lexi pantera lean on"],"title":"How to Brand Yourself & Your Company","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lQAjtU052LQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lQAjtU052LQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lQAjtU052LQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lQAjtU052LQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lQAjtU052LQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M25S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"110","dislikeCount":"32","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"1081","viewCount":"24324"}},{"id":"3-Vfd5bN_Yo","snippet":{"description":"In Case Study #22 I take a look at the debacle United Airlines (Fly the UNfriendly Skies) found itself in when a customer was, literally, dragged from a flight by airport security.\n\nWe all saw the videos (See link: https:\/\/youtu.be\/dASATLLvGRM) and the images were shocking.  It started when United offered four customers $1,000 in flight credit in exchange for being bumped from a flight, which happens in air travel.   United did not want to inconvenience four customers, but they needed to get four crew members to the next city because 200 passengers were at risk of being stranded on a flight in that other city.  So, in order to take care of 200 customers in another city, they were forced to bump four customers - but United wasn't saying \"tough luck,\" they offered $1,000 in flight credits.  Usually, college students traveling alone rush to the front of the line to take these deals.  It's basically free travel in exchange for drinking at the airport and hanging out for several hours and taking the next flight.\n\nIn this case, three customers had taken the deal \/ been bumped (peacefully) and United has no choice but to choose a 4th passenger.  This is usually done by evaluating frequent flyer status, who has checked luggage and ticket purchase factors to determine the \"odd man out.\"  Keep in mind, the selected person is going to get the $1,000 flight credit.  So United approaches Dr. David Dao and he says \"no thanks\" - but United says \"Sorry sir, this isn't a choice.\"  He then refuses to cooperate, which is understandable.  United explains further and Dr. Dao won't budge and United is now tweaked.  \n\nThat's when things go reallllllly bad.  \n\nBy not cooperating with United, they then had no sympathy for him and he wasn't going to change the fact that he was being bumped.  My take: United could have and should have moved on to the next customer and Dr. Dao was NOT SMART.  So now, United staff is thinking, \"OK, this guy is now being a pain - let's call security.\"  Dr. Dao then gets difficult with airport security which is NEVER prudent as we all know airport security and TSA have THEIR OWN SET OF RULES.  Dr. Dao actually told them \"you will have to drag me.\"  So they did and the rest is history and permanently memorialized here on YouTube.\n\nThis Episode includes a \"How to\" case study on the 5-steps of crisis communications that you (and United Airlines) can use in the future:\n\n(1) The Impacted People Must Come First\n     - Express sympathy and empathy.\n(2) Get Your Facts Straight - QUICKLY!\n       - Immediately interview the people on your team who were there - not their managers!\n(3) Be Transparent & Available to the Media\n      - By getting facts straight, you can give a truthful story ONCE and NEVER change it (which makes things worse).\n(4) OWN IT\n     - Accept that it happened at your company, you don't need to take legal responsibility if is not your fault. - but it happened at your company and you must own that part.\n(5)  Offer Solution\n     - You or your industry can learn from this and do something positive, and you can lead that effort.\n\nCome learn every Friday and take your company to the next level \u2013 subscribe to the Valuetainment channel on YouTube: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nValuetainment- The Best Channel for Entrepreneurs!","publishedAt":"2017-04-14T12:45:55Z","tags":["United","Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","Tom Ellsworth","biz doc","United man gets kicked out"],"title":"United Airlines - Fly the UNfriendly Skies.

What's her brand? Look up Cute Booty Lounge. In this video she covers 9 Ways to Overcome Catastrophic Events as an entrepreneur.

She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there. Kelly Nishimoto debuted her Spring\/Summer 2006 collection at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in March 2006. Feeling that fashion had no soul...she set out to make a full collection of things that were missing from her own closet. Simple elegance is how she described the flowing collection that graced the runway. Her Fall\/Winter\/Holiday 2006 collection was a perfect balance of her heritage...Scottish plaids and Japanese printed silks. Fresh off the runway is her Spring\/Summer 2007 collection she describes as women in the bedroom.\n\nValuetainment- The best channel for entrepreneurs.","publishedAt":"2017-04-08T13:57:56Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","kelly nishimoto","cutebooty lounge","cute booty lounge","something borrowed something new","best advice for female entrepreneurs","lexi pantera twerk","lexi pantera middle"],"title":"9 Ways to Overcome Catastrophic Events with Kelly Nishimoto","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tHUFtQlUTlU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tHUFtQlUTlU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tHUFtQlUTlU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tHUFtQlUTlU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tHUFtQlUTlU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT16M30S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"162","dislikeCount":"12","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"840","viewCount":"14000"}},{"id":"9lvlKBJ1Tss","snippet":{"description":"In Case Study #21 Tom Ellsworth, aka: The Biz Doc,  shares the story of Harley Davidson and how they don't just sell motorcycles, they sell admission to the badass club. \n\nHarley Davidson- A Cult Brand\n\nGrab your notebook, take notes and if you see something interesting, please leave a comment or share the video on social media along with your thoughts \u2013 join the conversation.\n\nCome learn every Friday and take your company to the next level \u2013 subscribe to the Valuetainment channel on YouTube: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nValuetainment- The Best Channel for Entrepreneurs!","publishedAt":"2017-04-07T13:06:44Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","valuetainment","patrick bet david","Harley Davidson- A Cult Like Brand","history of harley davidson","tom ellsworth","biz doc"],"title":"Harley Davidson Case Study - How A Cult Brand Was Made - A Case Study for Entrepreneurs","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9lvlKBJ1Tss\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9lvlKBJ1Tss\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9lvlKBJ1Tss\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9lvlKBJ1Tss\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9lvlKBJ1Tss\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT22M44S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"183","dislikeCount":"18","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"757","viewCount":"27954"}},{"id":"5dhOoGPuK7A","snippet":{"description":"Valuetainment has OFFICIALLY crossed over 250,000 subs.

Whether they are employees, contractors, partners, sales force or customers, you need to know how to deal with these different types of bully scenarios. Subscribe http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nWho is Kelly Nishimoto: \nhttp:\/\/www.kellynishimoto.com\/\n\nKelly Nishimoto was born in the back woods of Macon, Georgia to a Scottish Irish craftsman\/chemist\/musician father and a Japanese American jewelry designer mother. She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there. Kelly Nishimoto debuted her Spring\/Summer 2006 collection at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in March 2006. Feeling that fashion had no soul...she set out to make a full collection of things that were missing from her own closet. Simple elegance is how she described the flowing collection that graced the runway. Her Fall\/Winter\/Holiday 2006 collection was a perfect balance of her heritage...Scottish plaids and Japanese printed silks. Fresh off the runway is her Spring\/Summer 2007 collection she describes as women in the bedroom.\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nValuetainment- The best channel for entrepreneurs.","publishedAt":"2017-05-27T13:01:40Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","kelly nishimoto","How to Deal with Bullies in Business by Kelly Nishimoto","how to deal with bullies","how to fight bullies"],"title":"How to Deal with Bullies in Business by Kelly Nishimoto","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ptVZWGCMxAQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ptVZWGCMxAQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ptVZWGCMxAQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ptVZWGCMxAQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ptVZWGCMxAQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT9M34S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"94","dislikeCount":"16","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"516","viewCount":"10649"}},{"id":"U-_awGPbbt8","snippet":{"description":"How to Make \"Content\" Your Product by Tom Ellsworth aka \"The Biz Doc\" brings you case study #28.

At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap.

With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there.

She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there. Kelly Nishimoto debuted her Spring\/Summer 2006 collection at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in March 2006. Feeling that fashion had no soul...she set out to make a full collection of things that were missing from her own closet. Simple elegance is how she described the flowing collection that graced the runway. Her Fall\/Winter\/Holiday 2006 collection was a perfect balance of her heritage...Scottish plaids and Japanese printed silks. Fresh off the runway is her Spring\/Summer 2007 collection she describes as women in the bedroom.\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nValuetainment- The best channel for entrepreneurs.","publishedAt":"2017-05-06T15:14:21Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","valuetainment","patrick bet david","9 Ways to Balance Your Business & Personal Life"],"title":"9 Ways to Balance Your Business & Personal Life","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xecg0XiSJbg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xecg0XiSJbg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xecg0XiSJbg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xecg0XiSJbg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Xecg0XiSJbg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT13M39S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"114","dislikeCount":"22","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"600","viewCount":"13304"}},{"id":"tuRLpDMOHT0","snippet":{"description":"The balanced skills of leadership and how they are critical for every CEO to have.

At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment.

Subscribe http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nWho is Kelly Nishimoto: \nhttp:\/\/www.kellynishimoto.com\/\n\nKelly Nishimoto was born in the back woods of Macon, Georgia to a Scottish Irish craftsman\/chemist\/musician father and a Japanese American jewelry designer mother. She was exposed at a very early age to design and construction using a variety of materials. Her first wedding gown at age 13 was made of trash bags and a glue gun. At 19, after trading in GA's laid back country living for the frenetic night life of Miami's South Beach, Kelly created her first collection which included corsets, ball-room gowns, double breasted jackets, and handbags, all made using colored Reynolds Wrap. The line was a huge hit garnering her such accolades as \"Top Ten Designers to Watch\" by the Miami Herald.\n\nAfter 5 years in Miami's fashion circuit, Kelly ventured west in search of new inspiration. She found it immediately upon arriving in Los Angeles. Noticing everything she saw in the clothing market was shabby-chic and grunge, Kelly saw the perfect opportunity to bring back elegance, sophistication, and femininity by revisiting one of her favorite pieces...the corset! With lush fabrics and a more comfortable structure, Kelly breathed fresh air into an age-old garment. They quickly made a stir on red carpets across the country, Kelly Nishimoto corsets have already graced the bodies of Marley Shelton, Rumor Moore, Gwen Stefani, Anastasia, Natasha Hendstridge, Jenna Jameson, and yes...even Dave Navarro.\n\nThis self-taught designer didn't stop there. Kelly Nishimoto debuted her Spring\/Summer 2006 collection at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in March 2006. Feeling that fashion had no soul...she set out to make a full collection of things that were missing from her own closet. Simple elegance is how she described the flowing collection that graced the runway. Her Fall\/Winter\/Holiday 2006 collection was a perfect balance of her heritage...Scottish plaids and Japanese printed silks. Fresh off the runway is her Spring\/Summer 2007 collection she describes as women in the bedroom.\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nValuetainment- The best channel for entrepreneurs.","publishedAt":"2017-06-03T13:19:41Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","valuetainment","patrick bet david","How To Be Taken Seriously As a Female Entrepreneur","how to be taken serious","women in business","rise of female entrepreneur","famous female entrepreneurs","successful women in business","how to have investors take me seriously"],"title":"How To Be Taken Seriously As a Female Entrepreneur","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n12AV-3sA0s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n12AV-3sA0s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n12AV-3sA0s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n12AV-3sA0s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/n12AV-3sA0s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT10M23S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"87","dislikeCount":"58","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"466","viewCount":"13396"}},{"id":"AfkLmpqnjuQ","snippet":{"description":"The Biz Doc discusses How Cable is Getting Killed and how the new world of content will ride on OTT services.

It manufactures eponymous action cameras and develops its own mobile apps and video-editing software.\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nFrom the Biz-Doc: THANK YOU to everyone who made a comment about Karma.  You are correct!\n\n1.  I probably should have added that in detail - Karma was the drone that was (1) very late to the market - launched in October 2016; (2) performed badly and got recalled a month later when the battery suddenly would fail and it would crash and (3) got it\u2019s butt kicked by DJI who was already in the market.\n\n2.  The core issue of trying to be a Media Company in 2014 was the strategic distraction to the company - and this distraction caused them to spend a TON of cash and directly caused them to lose focus on their core products.

My mum, Lozza, is a great cook, in particular a phenomenal baker, and I would watch her every move while she baked. I am very partial to her corn and bacon muffins so she makes these for me whenever I visit. I still call on her regularly for advice when I\u2019m developing recipes \u2013 thanks Lozza! \n\nI was 4 years old, just a little tucker, when I had my first, truly memorable food experience. I tried my granny\u2019s Yorkshire fudge and it was one of the first really sweet things that I\u2019d tasted. I just couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Whenever I went to granny\u2019s place, from that first taste forward, we\u2019d get busy in the kitchen and make fudge together. It was our thing.\n\nIt was also around this ripe age of 4 that I tried my hand at cooking. I love to eat. I've always been a greedy little monster who can't get enough food. Learning how to cook was sort of an extension of always wanting to eat. My best mate's dad was a chef. He sort of lived this rock star lifestyle: He'd come in late from work and he had long hair and tattoos and he didn't conform to my dad's social circle where they all wore suits. I wanted what he had\u2026 \n\nAbout Valuetainment: Founded in 2012 by Patrick Bet-David, our goal is to impact entrepreneurs around the world through value and entertainment.

I would be doing a disservice if I didn\u2019t give some of the history about this estate.  In 1679 Simon van der Stel was appointed by the Dutch East India Company to govern the Cape of Good Hope. After years of loyal service, he requested land from the Company. He periodically sent out riders to collect soil samples and in 1685 he found a potential wine-growing area that had magnificent scenery situated behind Table Mountain. Over the years the wines produced on the estate caught the attention of influential people across the globe \u2013 clearly due to its impressive quality. Global aristocracy made sure that they had enough stock of this acclaimed and precious product. The estate was named \"Constantia\" after the Latin word for constancy or steadfastness. These attributes he valued greatly and today the winemaker, Boela Gerber and staff follow in his footsteps to uphold his enduring legacy of perfection at Groot Constantia.\n\nFollow Bradford:\nwebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beer_wine_sp...\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jeff-Bradfor...\nLinkedIn: http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfor...\n\n\nFilming and Editing by: Yoel Kamara: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2Im2Qi0\nYoel Kamara instagram: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2IooBgY\n\n\nAbout Beer, Wine & Spirits: This channel is a Valuetainment Production with Jeff Bradford as the host.

Subscribe to the Valuetainment channel on YouTube: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nABOUT ROBOKIND\nRoboKind is a Dallas-based company whose mission is to create cost-effective and inclusive education for all. Working with experts in the autism community and school systems around the world, RoboKind has developed two products, Robots4Autism and Robots4STEM, to give children opportunities to realize their potential and pursue their passions for all things tech related.\n\nWorking closely with the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) community, RoboKind has developed Robots4Autism and Milo, a socially advanced robot, who\u2019s proven effectiveness with learners with ASD is over 80 percent as opposed to the 3 percent for traditional therapy. Milo never gets tired, never gets frustrated, and is always consistent, which is important when teaching through repetition.

Now he turns to the most important subject of all - understanding people's drives and motivations, even when they are unconscious of them themselves.\n\nWe are social animals. Our very lives depend on our relationships with people. Knowing why people do what they do is the most important tool we can possess, without which our other talents can only take us so far. Drawing from the ideas and examples of Pericles, Queen Elizabeth I, Martin Luther King Jr, and many others, Greene teaches us how to detach ourselves from our own emotions and master self-control, how to develop the empathy that leads to insight, how to look behind people's masks, and how to resist conformity to develop your singular sense of purpose. Whether at work, in relationships, or in shaping the world around you, The Laws of Human Nature offers brilliant tactics for success, self-improvement, and self-defense.\n\nAbout Robert Greene: Robert Greene is an American author known for his books on strategy, power and seduction. He has written five international bestsellers: The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law and Mastery.\n\nSubscribe for more awesome interviews - http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nMusic selection used through agreement with Epidemic Sound http:\/\/bit.ly\/2B8DxK1\n\nAbout Valuetainment: \n\nFounded in 2012 by Patrick Bet-David, our goal is to impact entrepreneurs around the world through value and entertainment.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019. I truly believe Valuetainment will be known as the brand that inspired the next generation of great leaders, minds, innovators and Entrepreneurs around the world.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019.

Changiz is a Special Forces legend. He also happens to be the first Muslim Green Beret.\n\nChangiz served this country starting with Operation Eagle Claw in 1980, when he entered Tehran on a one-man mission to spy on Iranian soldiers guarding the US Embassy where 52 US diplomats were being held hostage. Three years later, he was in Beirut, Lebanon when a suicide car bomb exploded in front of the US Embassy killing 83 people. Weeks after that, he was shot by Hezbollah terrorists on a night mission.\n\nIn Operation Iraqi Freedom, he led a convoy that was ambushed on its way to Fallujah. He was clearing houses in Mogadishu, Somalia on October, 1993 when a US Black Hawk helicopter was shot down 50 feet away from him in the incident that inspired Black Hawk Down. In 2002, he dressed as a farmer and snuck into Eastern Afghanistan and located Osama Bin Laden for the CIA.\n\nAlong the way, Changiz earned numerous commendations, including the Special Forces Legion of Merit, Purple Hearts, and many others. Last year he was nominated for induction in Military Intelligence Hall of Fame and cited as \u201cthe finest noncommissioned officer to ever serve in Special Forces.\u201d\n\nTweet your thoughts:\n\nPatrick: https:\/\/twitter.com\/patrickbetdavid\n\nAbout Valuetainment: \n\nFounded in 2012 by Patrick Bet-David, our goal is to impact entrepreneurs around the world through value and entertainment.

How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019.

Now, they\u2019ve partnered once again to bring you entrepreneurial content Michael\u2019s never shared on any other platform. Michael will be speaking at The Vault Conference about \u201cHow to Be a Boss in Business\u201d this May in Dallas, TX.\n\nHe\u2019ll be announcing a NEW PROJECT exclusive to those who attend the VAULT.  \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already registered, click the link in the video or in the comments.

At this event, you'll learn how to:\n\nRECREATE YOURSELF\nYou are where you are based on the way you view money, success, relationships and yourself.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country.

How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019.

Tickets selling out! To register visit: https:\/\/thevaultconference.com\n\nGuest speakers: Michael Franzese and more being announced soon!\n\nThe Vault is a 3 day conference with Patrick Bet-David that will be held in Dallas, TX aimed to help Entrepreneurs, CEO\u2019s and Executives get clear on what they need to do to reach their individual capacity. At this event, you'll learn how to:\n\nRECREATE YOURSELF\n\nYou are where you are based on the way you view money, success, relationships and yourself. In order to recreate yourself, you will need a set of tools, strategies and mindsets to help you take that quantum leap to the next level.\n\n\nIDENTIFY YOUR NEXT 3 MOVES\n\nYour next 3 moves may be different than someone else\u2019s. At The Vault, we will identify your BEST next 3 moves in both your personal and business life.\n\n\nSCALE IN GOOD OR BAD TIMES\n\nMany know how to win during good economic times but only a few know how to win during a recession or an economic collapse. The Forbes 400 is made up of leaders who knew how to anticipate, adapt and adjust swiftly to capitalize during bad times.\n\nA MESSAGE FROM PATRICK BET-DAVID\n\nDear Entrepreneur,\n\nOver the years, many of you have asked me why I create content and openly share my strategies with you. The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019. I truly believe Valuetainment will be known as the brand that inspired the next generation of great leaders, minds, innovators and Entrepreneurs around the world. I will also be unveiling the vision of Valuetainment at the conference.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019. I truly believe Valuetainment will be known as the brand that inspired the next generation of great leaders, minds, innovators and Entrepreneurs around the world. I will also be unveiling the vision of Valuetainment at the conference. We are in search for leaders around the world and I can\u2019t wait to meet many of you face to face in Dallas.\n\nMuch love,\n\nPatrick Bet-David (Tweet: @patrickbetdavid)\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for your entrepreneur gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nAbout Valuetainment: \n\nFounded in 2012 by Patrick Bet-David, our goal is to impact entrepreneurs around the world through value and entertainment.

This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs on a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  These are stories of entrepreneurs in the beer, wine, and spirits industry,  and we can learn a lot from the way other founders have started their breweries, wineries and distilleries and see the world with Jeff Bradford. \n\nWhat an honor and experience it was to sit down and talk to Yves K\u00fcbler.  The legalization of absinthe in Switzerland and the United States is largely due to Yves K\u00fcbler's lobbying efforts.  The United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) approved the formula for K\u00fcbler Absinthe in 2004, and approved the product for sale in the United States in May 2007 after three years of discussions among K\u00fcbler, Food and Drug Administration, TTB, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These discussions proved to be instrumental in opening the door for many brands of absinthe to be legally sold or produced in the United States.\n\nThe history of K\u00fcbler \n\nK\u00fcbler was launched in 1863 by J. Fritz K\u00fcbler in M\u00f4tiers, Switzerland. M\u00f4tiers is the capital of the Val-de-Travers, the birthplace of absinthe. This region sits near the eastern border of France. Fritz opened the Blackmint Distillery in 1875, and received numerous awards and medals in competitions around the European theater before the Swiss government banned absinthe in 1910.\n\nIn 2001, the Swiss ban was lifted and the brand was revived by Fritz's great grandson Yves (a fifth generation K\u00fcbler), who runs the distillery only a few miles from its original site in the Val-de-Travers.\n\n\u201cK\u00fcbler Absinthe\" (well known by connoisseurs as F\u00e9e Verte\" or \"Swiss La Bleue\") falls back on the long tradition of the KUBLER dynasty who distilled this famous product from 1863 until its prohibition on October 7, 1910. After 93 years of slumber, K\u00fcbler Absinthe was reborn thanks to the decision of the Swiss Parliament in 2003.\n\n\nLinks to K\u00fcbler Absinthe: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.blackmint.swiss\/en\/absinthe\/real-absinthe\n\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/kublerabsinthe\/\n\nInstagram: @kublerabsintheusa\n\nLinks to Jeff Bradford:\n\nWebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\nInstagram: @beer_wine_spirits\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/beerwineandspirits\/\nLinked: http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfor...\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nFilming and Editing by: Yoel Kamara: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2Im2Qi0\nYoel Kamara instagram: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2IooBgY\n\nAbout Beer, Wine & Spirits: A Valuetainment Production with Jeff Bradford as the host.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019. I truly believe Valuetainment will be known as the brand that inspired the next generation of great leaders, minds, innovators and Entrepreneurs around the world.

This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs on a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  These are stories of entrepreneurs in the beer, wine, and spirits industry,  and we can learn a lot from the way other founders have started their breweries, wineries and distilleries and see the world with Jeff Bradford. \n\nWhen you think of Switzerland the first thing that doesn\u2019t come to mind is it\u2019s Whiskies.  Locher, one of the local Appenzell beer breweries, started making whisky back in 1999. In 2010, whisky expert Jim Murray named the Appenzeller S\u00e4ntis Malt \u201cDreifaltigkeit\u201d European Whisky of the Year.\n\nThe single malt whisky is named after mount S\u00e4ntis, the highest peak within the Alpstein mountains in Appenzell. \n\nAfter successfully selling their whisky in a few mountain inns, the idea of a whisky trek was born. Barrels of whisky were carried up the mountains to the 26 inns spread throughout the Alpstein. Thanks to the different barrels used, the height and climate situation of each inn, every whisky tastes different.\n\nWhen you hike up to one or more of these mountain inns, you can reward yourself with a glass of this special whisky while enjoying the amazing views. You can also buy a small bottle (100 ml) to take home. Once you are there, you may want to ask the host, cask keeper, to show you the barrels.\n\nLocher came up with two whisky tours that you can purchase at their shop. There is a short tour, which includes nine bottles, or the full tour, including all 26 bottles. With the purchase you will get a voucher booklet.  At every mountain inn, you exchange one coupon for one small collector bottle at each location. \n\nSome of the hikes are easier than others. If you are not familiar with the area, I would definitely check your planned route with the local tourist office before to make sure all paths are open and the level of difficulty is matching your current fitness level.\n\nLinks to S\u00e4ntis Malt: \nhttps:\/\/www.saentismalt.com\/en\/whiskytrek.html\n\nhttps:\/\/instagram.com\/saentis_malt_swissalpinewhisky?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=1n8qmavb93bqj\n\n\nWebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\nInstagram: @beer_wine_spirits\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/beerwineandspirits\/\nLinked: http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfor...\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nFilming and Editing by: Yoel Kamara: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2Im2Qi0\nYoel Kamara instagram: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2IooBgY\n\nAbout Beer, Wine & Spirits: A Valuetainment Production with Jeff Bradford as the host.

The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019.

Originally from California, Brian holds a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and moved to England sixteen years ago to be an investment banker in the City of London.\n\nAfter finding success in the world of banking, Brian had an epiphany while staying at Richard Branson\u2019s chalet in Switzerland: he hated his work, his life, and himself. So he resigned and created London Real. But it wasn\u2019t that simple: his journey was fraught with self-doubt, peer-pressure, and life-defining struggles. \n\nSince then London Real has broadcasted conversations with over 500 top influencers, released three feature-length documentary films, graduated over 3000 students from the London Real Academy, and become an internationally recognised brand known for the power of honesty, vulnerability, empowerment, and transformation.\n\nVisit London Real's website: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2I6l9q5\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for your entrepreneur gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nFounded in 2012 by Patrick Bet-David, our goal is to impact entrepreneurs around the world through value and entertainment.

At this event, you'll learn how to:\n\nRECREATE YOURSELF\nYou are where you are based on the way you view money, success, relationships and yourself. In order to recreate yourself, you will need a set of tools, strategies and mindsets to help you take that quantum leap to the next level.\n\n\nIDENTIFY YOUR NEXT 3 MOVES\nYour next 3 moves may be different than someone else\u2019s. At The Vault, we will identify your BEST next 3 moves in both your personal and business life.\n\n\nSCALE IN GOOD OR BAD TIMES\nMany know how to win during good economic times but only a few know how to win during a recession or an economic collapse. The Forbes 400 is made up of leaders who knew how to anticipate, adapt and adjust swiftly to capitalize during bad times.\n\nMESSAGE FROM PATRICK BET-DAVID\n\nDear Entrepreneur,\n\nOver the years, many of you have asked me why I create content and openly share my strategies with you. The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn\u2019t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I\u2019d create a brand called \u201cValuetainment\u201d that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.\n\nI got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.\n\nI got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.\n\nI got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.\n\nI got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.\n\nThis is why \u201cThe Vault\u201d is an event you must attend in 2019. I truly believe Valuetainment will be known as the brand that inspired the next generation of great leaders, minds, innovators and Entrepreneurs around the world. I will also be unveiling the vision of Valuetainment at the conference. We are in search for leaders around the world and I can\u2019t wait to meet many of you face to face in Dallas.\n\nMuch love,\n\nPatrick Bet-David (Tweet: @patrickbetdavid)\n\nVisit the official Valuetainment Store for your entrepreneur gear: https:\/\/www.valuetainmentstore.com\/\n\nAbout Valuetainment: \n\nFounded in 2012 by Patrick Bet-David, our goal is to impact entrepreneurs around the world through value and entertainment.

Why Beer, Wine and Spirits? This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs in a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  \n\nGood vintage (Dobra berba) was established in 2013 by Sa\u0161a \u0160tula who has always been driven by enthusiasm and desire to offer something new and different to the market.  Besides making quality wines in Croatia, His first breakthrough product was a winter cooked wine presented at Advent in Zagreb where it was recognised as an innovative and high quality product.  Through the years this product has become a staple for all winter events all across Croatian cities and even now to surrounding countries.\n\nIn 2017, \u0160asa has his mind set on another innovative product.  A sparkling wine known as Piena.  Through the technological and enological guidelines, charmat method and production from the local varieties of the Jason\u2019s region proved to be an excellent choice for this new Croatian sparkling wine.  Since then, Piena became a hit as soon as it was placed on the market. \n\n\nLinks to Dobra berba:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.dobraberba.hr\nhttp:\/\/zimskokuhano.com\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/zimskokuhano\/\n\nInstagram: @piena_sparkling\n                    @zimskokuhano\n\n\nFollow Jeff Bradford:\nwebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\n\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beer_wine_spirits\n\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jeff-Bradford-Beer-Wine-and-Spirits-351945165297488\/\n\nLinkedIn : http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfordstrategicleader\n\n\nFilming and Editing by:  Yoel Kamara\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.ymkfilms.co.uk\/\n: http:\/\/ www.instagram.com\/","publishedAt":"2019-05-25T12:45:00Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","valuetainment","Wine Making - Most Important Step of the Process","wine","jeff bradford","wine making","wine process"],"title":"Wine Making - Most Important Step of the Process","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V02AIEBLmZE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V02AIEBLmZE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V02AIEBLmZE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V02AIEBLmZE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/V02AIEBLmZE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT5M41S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"33","dislikeCount":"20","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"191","viewCount":"6448"}},{"id":"iBzHesG9j8M","snippet":{"description":"Patty McCord shares a series of stories from her time as Chief Talent Officer of Netflix at the Valuetainment conference - The Vault 2019 with Patrick Bet-David.

This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs on a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  These are stories of entrepreneurs in the beer, wine, and spirits industry,  and we can learn a lot from the way other founders have started their breweries, wineries and distilleries and see the world with Jeff Bradford.\n\nNeven is a name you will know about in a few years when discussing fruit brandy.  His attention to detail, respect to nature, and passion for distilling is something I truly admire and respect. I am so glad I got to learn from him and even more proud to call him my friend.\n\n He distilled his first fruit brandies with his father, when he was eight or nine years old. He learned to make whiskey on an ADI internship at the Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher Iowa and plans to open a distillery in his native Croatia.  Below is an excerpt from his article that was published in the distiller magazine: \n\nMy father and I were distilling pear brandy (home distilling is legal in Croatia) and we got in an argument about cuts, and I was educating him about the chemistry of distillation. You should have seen the look on his face.\n\nMy family has a generations-long tradition of distilling, with knowledge and skills passed from father to son. I have been distilling since the age of 8 or 9, when one autumn I first helped my father and my uncle to make fruit brandy. We produce various organic fruit brandies, primarily plum and pear, from the family\u2019s orchards. Every year since then I have either assisted or run the still myself. One day I started thinking: Why not start my own commercial distillery? That is something I would actually enjoy doing. The spark was there. The twinkle reappeared. I knew deep down that this was it.\n\nNeven is on his journey of making his dreams come true and Im looking forward to rooting for him and coming back to do a story about his distillery.\n\n\nLinks to NevenVorkapic:\nhttps:\/\/distilling.com\/distillermagazine\/living-the-dream-on-an-adi-internship\/    \nInstagram: @nevenvorkapic\nFacebook:  @Spirited Club               \n\nFollow Jeff Bradford:\nwebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\n\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beer_wine_spirits\n\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jeff-Bradford-Beer-Wine-and-Spirits-351945165297488\/\n\nLinkedIn : http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfordstrategicleader\n\n\nFilming and Editing by:  Yoel Kamara\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.ymkfilms.co.uk\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yoelkamara\n\nAbout Beer, Wine & Spirits: A Valuetainment Production with Jeff Bradford as the host.

Schlenkerla has become a magic word for a long time, but many do not know where this word originated. In this episode Jeff Bradford visits Bamberg Germany to talk about how they founded their brewery. \n\nWhy Beer, Wine and Spirits? This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs on a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  These are stories of entrepreneurs in the beer, wine, and spirits industry,  and we can learn a lot from the way other founders have started their breweries, wineries and distilleries and see the world with Jeff Bradford.\n\nBamberg and Smokebeer (the Germans call it \"Rauchbier\") belong together, a liaison which was not without consequences. The greatest of which is the Schlenkerla: the most productive, most visited and most traditional Smokebeer source in Bamberg, Germany. It originates in the middle of the old town, directly underneath the mighty cathedral, from a half-timbered house on which the geraniums effusively glow in the summer. Anyone who did not come here and try the strong, unmistakable taste of Original Schlenkerla Smokebeer (in German: Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier) cannot claim to have been to Bamberg.\n\nSchlenkerla has become a magic word for a long time, but many do not know where this word originated. Its roots lie within the Frankish vernacular, in which \"schlenkern\" is an expression for walking not straight - just like a drunken person does. Allegedly one of the former brewers had a funny way of walking due to an accident, or maybe due to the beer, and so he was called the \"Schlenkerla\" - the little dangler. The ending -la is the typical diminutive for the Frankish dialect. After a while, the residents of Bamberg also called the tavern Schlenkerla, and even though the sixth generation of brewers now taps the beer, the name has remained. Even in the phone book and the internet you can find the brewery under the name Schlenkerla. Today it stands for the tavern, the brewery and, most importantly, for the Smokebeer.\n\nSmokebeer from Schlenkerla is a dark, aromatic, bottom fermented beer with 13.5 percent original extract, which is equivalent to an alcohol content of 5.1 percent. No doubt: there are stronger beers, but nevertheless, one should not underestimate.\n\nThe connoisseur drinks it slowly with relish, but steadily and purposefully. He knows, that the second \"Seidla\" (half-liter) tastes better than the first, and the third even better than the second. He drinks during the morning pint and during the afternoon break.

As much as three quarters of the Slovenian hop fields are found in the region. A small part of produce is used for medicines, and the large rest is used for beer brewing.\n\nWhy Beer, Wine and Spirits? This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs on a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  These are stories of entrepreneurs in the beer, wine, and spirits industry. We can learn a lot from the way other founders have started their breweries, wineries and distilleries and see the world with Jeff Bradford.\n\nIntro continued:\n\nThe modern hop cultivation in the Savinjska Valley began in 1876, and in 1886 the first experiments with a sort from England were carried out. The results were good and the sort remained in the region ever since, known as the \u201cSavinja golding\u201d.  Varieties that are grown traditionally here are known as STYRIANS.\n\nSome of the hops grown on the Rojnik farm are the Styrian Golding, Styrian Wolf, Styrian Fox, and Styrian Dragon.  \n\nStyrian Wolf has a sweet tropical fruit character, aromas of mango, cassis, berries, and hints of violet.  \n\nStyrian Fox is another Slovenian hop that is citrusy, tropical fruit, and spicy-herbal top-notes. \n\nMy personal favourite hop name, Styrian Dragon, named for the mythical creature that adorns the bridge of the same name in Slovenia\u2019s capitol, Ljubjana, exhibits fleshy fruit, berries, passion-fruit, melon and sweet pepper.  All 3 three, are quite interesting and complex, but with a subtlety and finesse characteristic of old world cultivars.  Brewers around the globe will enjoy and get creative with these amazing hop varieties.\n\n\nLinks to Rojnik Hops and Green Gold Brewing: \n\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/pg\/hopsrojnik\/about\/?ref=page_internal&mt_nav=0\n\nhttps:\/\/www.greengoldbrewing.com\n\nhttps:\/\/m.facebook.com\/Ggbrewing\/\n\nInstagram: @greengoldbrewing\n\n\nFollow Jeff Bradford:\nwebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\n\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beer_wine_spirits\n\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jeff-Bradford-Beer-Wine-and-Spirits-351945165297488\/\n\nLinkedIn : http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfordstrategicleader\n\n\nFilming and Editing by:  Yoel Kamara\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.ymkfilms.co.uk\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yoelkamara\n\nAbout Beer, Wine & Spirits: A Valuetainment Production with Jeff Bradford as the host.

The festivities began October 12, 1810, and lasted nearly a week until October 17, ending with an exciting horse race. After such a spectacular party, the couple decided that the same type of festival should be continued annually. In the following years, the festivities were repeated every October and they eventually moved forward into September due to better weather.\n\nToday, Oktoberfest is the largest festival in the world, with an international flavor that is extremely characteristic of the 21st century. More than 6 million visitors from all over the world take part in Oktoberfest every year.\n\n\nHofbr\u00e4uhaus History in Munich\n\n1589- The Foundation of the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus\nOn September 27th 1589, Duke Wilhelm V. Founded a brewery on the site of the Munich residence - the ancient court ( der Alte Hof).  This first Hofbr\u00e4uhaus existed until 1808 and was only a few paces distance of today\u2019s Hofbr\u00e4uhaus.  They brewed brown beer.  Only the foundation document is preserved.\n\n1828- The Hofbr\u00e4uhaus for Everybody \nTo the regret of the innkeepers and private brewers, they feared a decrease in guests.  King Ludwig I. declared by decree the royal beerhall to become a public beerhall.  Even today regular guests of the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus recall this memorable event by a toast. \n\n1879- The registration of the trade-mark HB\nDuring the 19th century ambitious brewers loved to copy the successful sign of the then already worldwide known brand \u201cHofbr\u00e4uhaus\u201d This plagiarism only stopped when the trade-mark, which consisted of a crown and letters HB was declared trade-marked by the imperial patent office of Berlin in 1879.\n\nThe Hofbr\u00e4uhaus with it\u2019s history of more than 400 years, offers many stories which you can experience at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus exhibition.  Open daily from 9am - 1700 on the gallery of the historic festival hall (2nd floor).

Like many families in the region, he started to make his \"clandestine\" absinthe at home, fighting for space in the laundry with his wife!  \n\nLinks to La Clandestine Absinthe: \n\nhttps:\/\/www.laclandestine.com\/en\/laclandestine.html\n\nFacebook:  La Clandestine Absinthe\n\nInstagram: @laclandestineabsinthe\n\nWhy Beer, Wine and Spirits? This is a different segment that highlights companies and entrepreneurs on a different way of story telling - travel documentary.  These are stories of entrepreneurs in the beer, wine, and spirits industry,  and we can learn a lot from the way other founders have started their breweries, wineries and distilleries and see the world with Jeff Bradford.\n\nCont...\n\nStarting in 2000, he soon gained a reputation that began to spread beyond Switzerland. Using a recipe that dated back to 1935, he developed a new absinthe that he dedicated to its creator, Charlotte. Americans discovered his \"Clandestine La Bleue\" (or CLB as some called it) through various .... \"channels of distribution.\"\n\nAnd then in 2005, as absinthe developed throughout the world, Claude-Alain became the first distiller in the town where absinthe had been born to \"go legal.\"\n\nSince 2005, Claude-Alain's absinthe has become popular with absinthe lovers in Europe, North America and Asia. As it comes to the USA through more normal channels of distribution, some have asked whether, now that it is legal, it is now really \"Clandestine.\" By keeping its traditional name, it honours those who kept the absinthe fairy alive in Switzerland during the twentieth century and welcomes a new generation of drinkers.\n\nHow is La Clandestine different from most other absinthes? In fact, it is the ONLY absinthe hand-crafted in the village where absinthe was first born.\n\nEvery stage of the process used to distill and bottle La Clandestine is hand-crafted. Choosing the best plants, distilling each small batch, bottling and labelling.\n\nTrue to the traditions and now to the laws of Switzerland, La Clandestine absinthe is distilled (rather than just macerated as are some cheaper absinthes). None of the family of La Clandestine absinthes have any added artificial colour. All are 100% natural.\n\n\"Hand-crafted in the birthplace of absinthe,\" La Clandestine need no longer be a secret pleasure!\n\n\nFollow Jeff Bradford:\n\nwebsite is: http:\/\/www.jeffbeerwinespirits.com\n\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/beer_wine_spirits\n\nTwitter is: http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/jeffbradfordbws\n\nFacebook: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Jeff-Bradford-Beer-Wine-and-Spirits-351945165297488\/\n\nLinkedIn : http:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/jeffreybradfordstrategicleader\n\n\nFilming and Editing by:  Yoel Kamara\nWebsite: https:\/\/www.ymkfilms.co.uk\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/yoelkamara","publishedAt":"2019-06-08T12:45:01Z","tags":["Entrepreneur","Entrepreneurs","Entrepreneurship","Entrepreneur Motivation","Entrepreneur Advice","Startup Entrepreneurs","valuetainment","patrick bet david","how to drink absinthe","absinthe","switzerland","where is absinthe made","the best absinthe","the green fairy","How To Drink Absinthe"],"title":"Truth Exposed on How To Drink Absinthe","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WmW6vxh0TfE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WmW6vxh0TfE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WmW6vxh0TfE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WmW6vxh0TfE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WmW6vxh0TfE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}}},"contentDetails":{"duration":"PT7M22S"},"statistics":{"commentCount":"59","dislikeCount":"32","favoriteCount":"0","likeCount":"287","viewCount":"9892"}},{"id":"HTGzUVH9LsA","snippet":{"description":"Patrick Bet-David and Jonathan Tepper dive deep into the topic The Myth of Capitalism in this interview.

With my friend and partner Turi Munthe, we founded Demotix, a citizen-journalism website and photo agency that received photographs from freelance journalists and amateurs and marketed them to the mainstream media. We sold Demotix in 2012 to Corbis, a company owned then by Bill Gates.\n\nI\u2019m the author of the The Myth of Capitalism: Monopolies and the Death of Competition, Endgame: The End of the Debt Supercycle, and Code Red, a book on unconventional monetary policy.  Ocassionally I speak at investment conferences (you can enquire here.)\n\nEarlier in my career, I worked as an equity analyst at SAC Capital and as a Vice President in proprietary trading at Bank of America.\n\nAs a kid, I was a bit of a nerd.  Some things don\u2019t change very much.  I earned a BA with Highest Honors in History and Honors in Economics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a M.Litt. in Modern History from Oxford University.  I am a Rhodes Scholar and am Chairman of the Rhodes Scholars in Britain.\n\nI grew up in San Blas, a neighborhood of Madrid that had one of the highest rates of drug use in Europe. My parents started Betel International, a drug rehabilitation center that has grown from one addict in 1985 to over 2,300 addicts in 25 countries.

A significant focus of his career was directed toward investigating Middle East hijackings in which American citizens were victimized.\n\nBehind the Story: In 1993, a 51-day standoff took place at the Mount Camel compound in Waco, Texas between the FBI\/ATF and religious cult, the Branch Davidians. Upon the FBI\u2019s suspicion that the group, led by David Koresh, was illegally stockpiling weapons, a timeline of events led to a tragic fire that killed 76 members of the Davidians, including its leader and 20 children.\n\nSubscribe to Valuetainment for weekly videos http:\/\/bit.ly\/2aPEwD4 \n\nPBD Instagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/patrickbetdavid\/ \n\nPBD Twitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/patrickbetdavid \n\nPBD Linkedin: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/patrick-bet-david-3731553\n\nIntro song : \u201cSweet Victory\u201d by R-Mean.
